"@jljacobson and arguing its self evident is a little ingenious. I'd say if anything, the claim that fetus != person is a leap of faith"
"@jljacobson i view abortion as a moral right/wrong, don't care about politics/economics of it. and i support contraception/sex ed."

"@jljacobson anyways, that's always where this dialogue gets stuck, lol."
"@jljacobson  aborting a fetus is making a medical decision for that human/fetus, like you say."
@jljacobson right but the prolife contention is an unborn person has rights too. And like you note..
"submitted a paper for pub last night after a crazy week of work. basically took today off, gonna play some star wars rebillion"
"@jljacobson agreed. And most pro-life people would argue the complement as well, that mother's rights don't overrule the fetus'"
@jljacobson and thanks for the kind words for the fam. really just a long slowburn senility..tougher for my stepmom.
@jljacobson fetus is equivalent to killing somebody who has cancer or some terminal illn. My question is why don't u consider them the same?
