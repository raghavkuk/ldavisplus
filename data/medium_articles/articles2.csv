I also know you do this because nobody not doing it is reading this. We are the troubled, and we read things like that and know it‚Äôs for us, because we know it‚Äôs true. I say we because I do it too, from time to time ‚Äî I think ‚Äúheartbreak‚Äù is the most beautiful human emotion and I wallow on occasion ‚Äî and I tell you there‚Äôs no shame, because there isn‚Äôt.
But we also all have a choice, and many of us are choosing.
Stop thinking you‚Äôre not worth happiness and emotional wellbeing, because it‚Äôs a basic need to which each person is entitled ‚Äî if they only pause and claim it.
Stop blaming yourself for every failure.
Stop blaming others as well.
Stop ruminating on finding who‚Äôs to blame for anything that goes wrong; stop obsessing on where it should be placed.
Stop hanging onto history; stop flinging the windows open into the cold front; stop leaving glass panels hanging on their hinges in the wind.
Love yourself ‚Äî first ‚Äî the way you want to be loved. Nobody is going to love you more, and if anybody other than your mom swears otherwise, run.
Speak kindly to yourself. Speak to yourself with positivity and care. Accept and embrace yourself the way you want your partner to.
Reconnect with the most positive spirits in your life, where you can make forward progress, rather than obsessing over the past.
Be your own best friend, your own cheerleader, your own soulmate.
Speak with words of love and encouragement. Speak with patience and kindness. Speak forgiveness and optimism for all you‚Äôve learned, and what‚Äôs to come.
Treat yourself with love, and do not bind yourself in heartbreak.

John Gorman|162K|4|https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-3-keys-to-becoming-irresistible-d2f689ea4bf1?source=---------1---------------------|The 3 Keys to Becoming Irresistible ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"There‚Äôs a routine question asked in job interviews, first dates, table games and so on: What is the most important thing you look for in other people?
There‚Äôs variations on this format (i.e. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the most attractive quality you look for in a potential partner?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your greatest strength?‚Äù And so on) but, in general, the answer remains the same: The character trait you hold above all. When pressed, I‚Äôve often stumbled and resorted to something trite and probably not true: honesty, humor, confidence, charisma, etc. Those are fine answers but they‚Äôre not in my estimation the correct ones.
And so one day I sat down on my pleather couch, brewed some holy basil tea, queued up some Anderson Paak on the Spotify and really, truly tried to whittle down the essence of what makes truly admirable, special people exactly that. I analyzed people I looked up to, people I was attracted to, and people I just couldn‚Äôt dream to be without. And I found that the answer could never be just one thing, and that many of the things I think I admire are manifestations of other, deeper things I admire more. Here are the three components that, when taken together, create a spellbinding supernova of a person ‚Äî one who can command a room and control their destiny, one who can be both altruistic and intelligent. And so I give them to you and make a case for each.
This trait is the root of all growth, learning and kindness. It‚Äôs the belief that you are not yet so great that your mind cannot be opened, and it‚Äôs the presence of mind to remember that we are all interconnected equals, and that injustice against one is an injustice against all. It is, flatly, an absence of entitlement. People who exhibit humility let their work speak for itself, they remain stoic in the face of their own suffering, and they remind themselves ‚Äî and others ‚Äî that life is fragile and therefore valuable. Humility quells ignorance and cultivates grace. I want this in the people I hold dear.
Without curiosity, you cannot be enthralling or even engaging, nor ‚Äî most rudimentary of all ‚Äî successful. It is frankly impossible. Curiosity drives an insatiable quest for knowledge, culture, novelty, experience, beauty, art and connection. It is the bedrock upon which you can build a life filled with stories, memories, accomplishments and relationships. People who exhibit curiosity can become masters, or polymaths, or auteurs ‚Äî but they must first always have an open mind. They first seek to listen, to absorb, to immerse, to traverse. The world is too large and their time on it too short to ever remain fully satisfied in their pursuit of whatever new ideas pass in front of them. I want people around me to remain curious, routinely examining the world through fresh eyes, and using their eyes to find fresh corners of the world.
This trait is the miracle drug of humanity (and elephants, and dolphins). It is the simplest, sweetest attribute one can possess, and the most worthwhile one worth cultivating for social success. Empathy brings people closer, and makes others feel understood and less alone inside. And if there is one thing we‚Äôre all looking to become a little less of, it‚Äôs alone. When I see truly empathetic people, I see people who genuinely care, but also people who remind us that sometimes it‚Äôs okay to be still with someone else and not invade their space or encroach their boundaries. This unique ability to understand the world through others‚Äô eyes and cut to the heart of what others are feeling and experiencing. Empathy breeds compassion, connection and love. It is an important precursor for honesty.
You may have noticed the three are closely related. This is no mere accident. In fact, when you stack humility, curiosity and empathy, you can easily see how they amplify each other.
Humility is the soul. Curiosity is the mind. Empathy is the heart.
Humility is how you value yourself. Curiosity is how you value your others. Empathy is how you value the bonds between yourself and others.
Humility is the soil of knowledge. Curiosity is the water that helps it grow. Empathy is the sunlight that shows us which way to bend.
And if you take any two without the third, you‚Äôre missing a crucial component: Humble, curious, apathetic people are slothful. Humble, disaffected, empathetic people are sensitive but not very interesting. Brash, curious, empathetic people are exhausting. But when you bring them all together, you create a benevolent triad.
These three traits are the key to becoming warm, smart and memorable. They‚Äôre irrepressible and irresistible. They‚Äôre my favorite qualities in others: the most attractive, the strongest, the most admirable. And whether I‚Äôm hiring them, dating them or learning from them, these are the qualities I look for above all others.

He flies under the radar compared to other men. You‚Äôre not that attracted ‚Äî he‚Äôs irritatingly intellectual, a total nerd, somewhat of a killjoy.
But you reconnect later. Maybe it‚Äôs days later, maybe it‚Äôs a year.
He reaches out because of something interesting you wrote. It‚Äôs your writing, it‚Äôs always your writing that draws them in.
He‚Äôs not your usual type, so you have no plans to fall in love.
You discover: he‚Äôs interesting, he‚Äôs fascinating, he might very well be a genius. When he talks about data sets, somehow it‚Äôs poetry to your ears. His hobbies are unexpected and wide-ranging: philosophy, fishing, tango.
He was a terrible student in high school, yet highly accomplished outside of it. Maybe he traveled across Europe for chess tournaments, or around the U.S. for tennis championships, or spent long hours sketching art in a black sketch book.
There was one teacher in particular that believed in him, and that made all the difference.
He‚Äôs extraordinarily successful, astonishingly well-connected. If he was bored in school, he‚Äôs been challenged like no other in his career. He has driven an original idea or ambition to completion, with a discipline and willpower you can only imagine, achieved what most humans could only dream of.
And yet the more successful and brilliant he is in a particular area, the more awkward and incompetent he is in the most basic of others: he forgets to eat, he can‚Äôt pick out his own clothes, he can‚Äôt boil an egg.
But you smile when you learn of these quirks. You find them endearing.
He finds himself talking to you a lot, telling you things he has never told anyone else. You both conclude this must mean your connection is special. He cares about his mom, and his brother or his sister, but he fought a lot with his dad. His dad was narcissistic and cruel, and it‚Äôs an emotional scar that still wounds him today.
He‚Äôs got a penchant for logic games, and he speaks multiple languages. French, German, Japanese ‚Äî you will be entranced the first time you hear him speak another language, amazed by the worlds he floats effortlessly into that you could never know.
He‚Äôs a mathematician, analytical, an engineer, a hacker ‚Äî but above all, he loves to solve problems. There‚Äôs no problem he can‚Äôt solve or won‚Äôt try. To hack his brain, simply suggest a hypothetical problem and watch his mind spin in search of a solution.
He admits that he works a lot, he doesn‚Äôt meet a lot of women, but he‚Äôs looking for the right woman: smart, driven, beautiful. Not one for online dating or apps, he hates dating, and he‚Äôs frustrated and clueless.
You‚Äôre puzzled as to why. There is an aura of mystique that surrounds him when you meet, a kind of power and presence in his energy that he isn‚Äôt even aware of, and that is exactly what makes him so intriguing.
He may unexpectedly sweep you off your feet with his depth, his intensity, his thoughtfulness. Watch him when he‚Äôs lost in thought, for that faraway yet intent look in his eyes.
Suddenly you will find yourself in love with this strange but brilliant man.
When it comes to smart, introverted men, you may very well be the only woman they have liked in awhile. Fatally shy, they may never ask you out.
But if they do, each and every one of them will be almost comically nervous around you. Their hearts will race like crazy the first time they hold your hand, walking along the city‚Äôs waterfront under a starlit night sky.
You will hear the same words over and over from them: You are amazing, you are beautiful, you are gorgeous. Your skin is so soft, you feel so good, we fit so well together.
They say that they love you and that they care a lot about you. Perhaps you decide, against your better judgment, yes, why not, you would like to go on a crazy journey together.
Congratulations: you will know a depth and intensity of a connection few would think possible.
Every time, it‚Äôs the little things that make you love him even more. He‚Äôs attentive to detail, gracefully anticipates your needs. Oddly neurotic in the strangest of ways: afraid of heights, of germs, sensitive to sounds. You‚Äôve never met someone with his sleep patterns: he sleepwalks, he needs very little sleep, he‚Äôs out like a light.
Mostly, he just wants to make you happy. He loves to be with you, just to hear you talk.
You will laugh together, play together, dream up inspiring futures together. In the span of a few minutes, you can shift easily from giggling like silly 4-year-olds to discussing the troubling impact of AI on our species.
You‚Äôll make love. You‚Äôll fuck. Relax blissfully into each other‚Äôs arms. Lulled into a sense of home.
You will know a oneness that transcends worlds, and words.
One day, he will decide to leave you. It will be sudden and swift with no warning.
Troubled at last by doubt, terrified that committing any further will hurt you, triggered by personal traumas, he will decide, quietly, independently ‚Äî because that is how he has solved every problem ‚Äî that it‚Äôs over.
He‚Äôll miss your insights. Your freewheeling conversations. But that‚Äôs it.
His willpower and discipline means you will never hear from him again. The linearity of his mind means he will conclude, like a logic game, you were not meant to be.
He will not look back, QED.
You will never really know why. You will be haunted for days, months, even years. Till the end of time.
When you meet such a man, do not fall in love. You will be demolished, devastated, systematically destroyed, yet again, by yet another smart, introverted man.
Every single time.

Harry J. Stead|3.1K|8|https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-truth-about-finding-fulfilment-in-life-3df8ed42e4ae?source=---------3---------------------|Truth About Finding Fulfilment In Life ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"In 1985, the writer Joseph Campbell sat down with interviewer Bill Moyers for a lengthy discussion about Campbell‚Äôs ideas on comparative mythology and the ongoing role of myth in human society. The interviews were edited and reduced to six one-hour episodes. Each were broadcasted on PBS in 1988, shortly after Campbell‚Äôs death, in what turned out to be one of the most popular series in the history of public television.
Afterwards, the transcript of the entire unedited conversation was published in a book called ‚ÄòThe Power of Myth‚Äô. The book is a true spectacle, a roaring celebration of human history and experience; the depth of Campbell‚Äôs knowledge was remarkable and the enthusiasm in his words bring joy to the hearts of all. It is one of few books that I find myself returning to repeatedly.
The most rewarding part of the discussion, the part that brings the most impact deals with the idea of living a fulfilling life, or, as Campbell would put it, ‚Äòfollowing your bliss‚Äô. During the interview, Campbell quotes from Sinclair Lewis‚Äô novel ‚ÄòBabbit‚Äô:
‚ÄòBabbit‚Äô tells the story of a man who is dissatisfied with the promises of ‚ÄòThe American Dream‚Äô. He feels empty in his home town called Zenith, a typical American city where the chief virtue is conformity.
And so, Babbit tries to pursue a meaningful life through various acts of nonconformity and deviance. The novel shows how he eventually, after many failed disgruntled wanderings, returns to tired conformity; however, Babbitt never quite loses hold of the sentiment that there awaits a life more meaningful and fulfilling that he has yet to grasp.
Babbit, Campbell believed, is a character who has never experienced what it is like to be truly alive; he is a man who has never lived with rapture, a man not conscious of himself, nor aware of the great fire that he holds within himself.
The ‚Äòfollow your bliss‚Äô philosophy attributed to Campbell after the original broadcast of The Power of Myth comes from the Hindu Upanishads, a collection of ancient texts of religious and philosophical nature, written in India probably between c. 800 BCE and c. 500 BCE.
Campbell studied such texts with great persistence and passion when he was a young man. Indeed, before he became a professor, he lived in a small, rented shack in Woodville, New York, and consumed his days engaged in rigorous and intensive independent study, reading ancient scriptures and mythology of all kinds, from across the globe. This routine carried on for five years before he became a teacher at Sarah Lawrence College. Clearly, Campbell had found his own bliss in the study of myths and folklore.
He came across the idea of bliss when he was learning the language of Sanskrit. Sanskrit is an ancient Indian language and it is the predominant language of most works of Hindu philosophy as well as some of the principal texts of Buddhism and Jainism. Here, Campbell highlights three words that carried Campbell to the idea of bliss:
‚ÄòThere are three terms that represent the brink, the jumping-off place to the ocean of transcendence: Sat, Chit, Ananda. The word ‚ÄòSat‚Äô means being. ‚ÄòChit‚Äô means consciousness. ‚ÄòAnanda‚Äô means bliss or rapture.‚Äô
He follows this explanation by showing how he used these three words to guide his own life, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know whether my consciousness is proper consciousness or not; I don‚Äôt know whether what I know of my being is my proper being or not; but I do know where my rapture is. So let me hang on to rapture, and that will bring me both my consciousness and my being.‚Äô
And so, Campbell held onto his love of mythology and religion with faith that his bliss would guide him to where he was supposed to be. This willingness to live with the questions, to bathe in uncertainty was indeed daring. But, for Campbell, the adventure of living alongside his bliss was its own gift.
In 1934, Campbell accepted a position as Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence College. In the Power of Myth, he explained how the school used a system whereby each student was assigned a teacher to talk with for half an hour about how they were getting along. This meeting occurred once every two weeks.
And Campbell would ask his students about each of their classes, what kind of books they had been reading and what they enjoyed outside of their classes. The school was trying to speed up the process of self-discovery because they understood that their reputation depended on the consciousness of their students.
During the conversation, Campbell, quite suddenly, touched upon a particular topic that caused the student‚Äôs eyes to light up and widen with enthusiasm. In an instant, the student sat up and began talking with eagerness and emotion, sometimes so fast they forgot to breathe. Life had reignited within the spirit.
This short meeting served as a sacred space for the students, a chamber that allowed for uninterrupted reflection and personal discovery, without haste or pressure. Such a meeting encouraged the students to move within, to scramble amongst their depth and question who they really were.
But this meditation requires a state of reflective solitude, a peaceful harmony where no one is able to speak into your thoughts, telling you what is or what is not the truth. And Campbell allowed his students this sacred space by only asking questions, never twisting their answers, and allowing them time to think through their hearts, to reach into their true self, even permitting the students to go home and think about the question more thoroughly before returning the following week. Over time, the students became ever more so aware of who and what they were.
Solitude and self-reflection, then, allows you the freedom to feel the vibrations of your own soul and the direction it wants to carry you towards. It is in solitude that you are able to hear the little patters of intuition that are trying to tell you where your bliss might lay.
The students, by speaking about a topic that fulfilled them, opened their hearts and revealed a small glimpse into who they truly are. They unfastened their arms and, entirely defenceless, touched upon a consciousness that no sensible person ought to get themselves involved with.
For a brief moment, they became overwhelmed with love and passion, and entered into a world of their own, singing the chorus of their spirit. And Campbell sincerely hoped his students would hang onto this rapture with all their love. For life and possibility had opened up to the student when they had allowed this love to wash over them.
When you are in love, you are in touch with the divine; you have the sensation that you are standing in the centre, that you have discovered what has been waiting for you all this time. Those who know better understand that they ought to trust this feeling even when, especially when, it seems irrational or foolish. For love has the power to create heroism from timidity, to make even the most uncertain path feel certain.
And this love belongs to you ‚Äî it exists for no one else but you. It cannot be taught, nor manufactured, nor even helped. It is spontaneous, as you are also. For love only serves as a reflection into yourself. You cannot find it everywhere, and to believe so would be to lessen the true miracle of the word.
You only discover its power when you see some part of yourself in another that you did not recognise before. And when you discover this love, this shattering rapture, you also discover yourself. Hang onto this passion and, Campbell believed, you will gradually become who you truly are.
You are not your own puppet, you cannot create from the sheer thin air your own values. You have a nature, a belonging, a desire to understand what you are. And you pursue this yearning with great pain and frustration. You will fall over, bite your own lip, break your own heart, and all the while you are discovering who you are, following, with a great appetite, that which calls your name, all the lights and sounds of your soul.
This is your calling, your responsibility, your deepest burden. But you refuse such a duty at your own peril. Because you are not merely following your bliss, but also your blisters, everything that compels you to become who you actually are.
And if you just follow your heart, that strange turmoil that is happening within, you will see that you are more than you are. You will grow to become conscious of your being ‚Äî who and why you are ‚Äî and living the life you ought to be living.

Ditch Loyalty ‚Äì Jessica Wildfire ‚Äì Medium|"Love triangle didn‚Äôt quite cover it. We were more of a pentagram. My best friend had told my fiance a secret. One that he wouldn‚Äôt share with me. Until I threatened to dump him.
That‚Äôs when he told the truth. My best friend had slept with my second best friend‚Äôs fiance. Seven times.
So there I was, caught between the most important people in my life. They were all going to make me choose.
It‚Äôs the kind of thing that can make your head explode.
Or your heart. If you have one.
My fiance didn‚Äôt like the ultimatum. He said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre making me do this. She made me promise not to tell anyone.‚Äù
Long term, none of that mattered. My fiance and I split less than a year later. So did my second best friend and hers.
We‚Äôve all grown apart since then. Not just because of the betrayal and sabotage. People move away. Start families. New priorities rise up. Something else always comes along to claim your loyalty.
The concept means almost nothing. Other words do a way better job at describing our relationships. Responsibility. Duty. Trust. Respect. Mutual interest. Personally, that one‚Äôs my favorite. No bullshit there. People work together toward a common goal.
You know you can trust someone when you both stand to benefit. Nobody‚Äôs going to screw you if it means screwing themselves.
Sound jaded? Don‚Äôt worry, throwing away the idea of loyalty will make you happier. You don‚Äôt need it.
Loyalty carries a lot of baggage, along with words like obligation and sacrifice. I mean, come on. If you really want to spend your life with someone, then you‚Äôre not sacrificing anything.
You‚Äôre making a choice about what you want more.
In a perfect world, everyone who decides to become a spouse or parent would stick with it. In my worst moments, I‚Äôve never wanted to actually leave my family. And I can‚Äôt think of a situation where that would change.
Meanwhile, I‚Äôve known enough shitty husbands and dads. Wives and moms. People who ruin their families, or just walk away.
My advice: let them.
The last thing you want is someone hanging around only due to a false sense of loyalty, pride, or obligation. Screw that.
You deserve better.
Mutual interest does a lot more legwork than you think. It was the only thing that convinced my fiance to tell me the truth.
My friend had sought his loyalty. I, on the other hand, simply told him it was impossible to trust someone who kept secrets. Especially if they also told me they were doing it ‚Äî apparently to seek my sympathy.
That‚Äôs right. He wanted me to feel bad for him, for choosing to keep a secret from me, for my own best friend.
My fiance had to make a choice about what he valued more. His weird, misplaced loyalty to my friend. Or me.
He chose me, that time.
You know, I probably should‚Äôve just dumped him.
After that, I had to decide what to tell my second best friend. A lot of thought went into my options. Ultimately I told her nothing. Loyalty offered no guidance here. In the end, it just wasn‚Äôt my place to get involved. Staying silent felt disloyal. But it felt right.
Telling my friend would‚Äôve been self righteous. After all, who was I to decide what should happen?
Loyalty usually offers nothing but a couple of trinkets and a t-shirt. It takes everything, though. Blind trust. Allegiance. Sacrifice. Someone who wants your loyalty doesn‚Äôt give a shit about you. They want you to serve them. Or a higher purpose. Watch out for those, too.
Some people love to pledge their loyalty. The word conjures up lofty images and makes us feel important. But it really only applies to a small handful of situations. I‚Äôm thinking of a secret service agent who takes a bullet. Or a soldier who gives up their life to save their unit.
Yes, that‚Äôs loyalty.
Most of what we do in the civilian world never approaches that level of commitment. So let‚Äôs lay off. Stop abusing the word.
We over-apply loyalty to relationships. Say what you want about the institution of marriage, but people have broken their vows ever since it was invented. Infidelity doesn‚Äôt pose a mortal threat to anyone.
It just sucks.
People cheat on each other and abandon their families all the time. A single mom or dad struggles on.
Responsibility makes a lot more sense when it comes to every aspect of our lives, including family and marriage. For example, every couple shares responsibility for the basic stuff ‚Äî food, shelter, clothing. Transportation. Bills. If you think you‚Äôre loyal for contributing to your family, get over yourself. You‚Äôre really just meeting the bottom tier.
Congratulations, you‚Äôre not a shit bag.
You can take a small amount of pride in carrying your weight as a regular, decent human being.
We owe our spouses honesty. As in we‚Äôre not supposed to sleep with someone else, without telling them. And so on.
Beyond that, relationships aren‚Äôt that hard. You get what you put into them. Some of my friends of yore have wanted too much from me, and others didn‚Äôt give enough. We couldn‚Äôt meet in the middle.
So our friendships ended.
Same thing applies to life partners. Right now, I‚Äôm in a relationship where we give and take equally. We don‚Äôt feel compelled to tell each other absolutely everything. But we don‚Äôt hide, either.
I‚Äôm not sure loyalty is the right word to describe what we have. More like long term mutual interest with benefits. We like having sex with each other, and in addition to that we trust each other‚Äôs judgment.
That doesn‚Äôt sound very romantic. But it works really well. And it‚Äôs a lot harder to find that than you think.
Loyalty makes us do stupid things. It carries an unfair sense of expectations. You can‚Äôt show loyalty to everyone. So stop trying.
None of my advice means you should only act out of self interest. A mature adult realizes that there‚Äôs no such thing. Your values and goals always get tangled up with other people‚Äôs.
Strop trying to be loyal. Cultivate honesty and fairness. Nothing comes in the form of lifelong guarantees. Build your friendships on mutual interest and respect, and you can‚Äôt go wrong.

It comes with sacrifice as much as joy. It comes with times of unbelievable laughter and that of exquisite loneliness. It comes with uncertainty coupled with hope, and new experiences hidden behind doors that feel like a magic you never believed in.
I had left love. My career. The future I thought I would‚Äôve settled for, and the people I knew always had my back. I had left everything I‚Äôd told myself I was certain of, and somehow I hadn‚Äôt walked out on any of it.
They don‚Äôt tell you how to recognize which moment means you‚Äôre almost there, and the sorts of moments that become evidence that it‚Äôs gone on too long. They don‚Äôt lead you to understand that you‚Äôre asking the wrong questions, rather than losing control.
Your experiences become tasks, and your giggles become sounds you don‚Äôt believe in. You start to question who you are, and suspect that this is all there is. You start to lose faith in the idea of purpose. And assume ‚Äúpassion‚Äù is a word for the privileged.
And you begin to thread together stories. Ones of how you‚Äôre not cut out for a different life, or how your current one isn‚Äôt so bad. You create excuses that sound like crashing trees in a burning forest. And you lose yourself, in the hope that everything will work out like it‚Äôs supposed to.
The betrayal between you and yourself. The betrayal of looking into the mirror and seeing someone you don‚Äôt recognize. The betrayal of wanting to love your life and not knowing how.
The advice will seem obvious. Leave the job you don‚Äôt love. Walk away from the man who hurts you. Become the woman of your dreams.
What they don‚Äôt tell you ‚Äî what they fail to mention, is that it doesn‚Äôt happen that way.
To the untrained eye, I left my stable job, consistent income and comfort of my home, in a day. To the outsider, I packed as much as I could into a suitcase and effortlessly purchased a one-way ticket. To those who didn‚Äôt know me, I was brave, and adventurous and didn‚Äôt care about my career.
But they‚Äôre all wrong.
I began by leaving my job every day. For months. Until parts of me were so far removed, they had become capable of doing the work without asking what it was I was doing. I started packing in my mind long before I moved each piece of clothing from my closet to my suitcase. I started saying goodbye well before anyone even knew I was leaving.
And it wasn‚Äôt courage that led me to that place. It was holding my breath. It was jumping in before I was ready, and continuing to swim after it was too late to turn back.
I think when it‚Äôs chalked up to bravery, it simplifies all the anguish. It casts a shadow over the uncertainty. It neglects the days and weeks and months of nothingness before I felt like my heart was beating again.
And I wasn‚Äôt brave, but I‚Äôm capable of bravery. I wasn‚Äôt sure. But I‚Äôm capable of surviving uncertainty. I wasn‚Äôt ready, but looking back, I‚Äôve never been.
The ‚Äòdoing‚Äô is rarely the outcome of deciding.
Because deciding comes after the instances you chose to ignore. It follows the circumstances you allowed to play out. It‚Äôs right behind the bargains you made with destiny, and the ‚Äúone more chance‚Äù after you said ‚Äúno more.‚Äù
Deciding buys you time on your journey to doing. Deciding gives you space to hash out every possible thing that could go wrong. Deciding is a remedy for sitting still, but it isn‚Äôt the guarantee of a better life.
I recognized it was time to go when I was standing in front of the mirror asking myself if the person I was becoming was the person I wanted to be, and the answer made me tremble. I recognized it was time to walk away when I realized the people I loved were not the ones receiving my love, and I had forgotten how to let them in. I made a choice between the fear of the unknown and the fear of what I knew would destroy me.
And I learned. I learned that I needed plenty of days to get it wrong and only one to get it right. I learned that only I could create the answer I was looking for, regardless of to whom I asked the question. And I learned that the things you were never meant to leave, will still be there if you come back. Because sometimes leaving is an obligation ‚Äî and that makes it a duty, not desertion.
If you enjoyed this post, I‚Äôd love if you hit that clap.. And if you have thoughts, stories or questions I‚Äôd love to hear them.

Because it‚Äôs mostly shit advice.
Here‚Äôs a small sampling:
This is infatuation.
If someone‚Äôs ‚Äúalways‚Äù on your mind, you‚Äôre not focused on other Really Important Things. And that‚Äôs a problem.
Real love fits into real life, rather than usurping it. It‚Äôs calm, not overwhelming.
See above.
Ditto.
Well, I mean, damn. You fantasize long and hard enough, you can see anything in your future ‚Äî like I could imagine moving to Switzerland to be a goat farmer. That doesn‚Äôt mean I should.
The problem is that we‚Äôve made ‚Äúlove‚Äù into a game of escapism, and measure potential partners by how they fit into that fantasy. That‚Äôs not love.
So, sure, see them in your future ‚Äî but not because they ‚Äúcomplete the picture.‚Äù
See above.
Ha. Hahaha. Clearly you have never been in a (healthy) long-term relationship.
You should usually want to see bae. But love isn‚Äôt always wanting to. Sometimes you need a minute. Sometimes you need to work or do other things. Or, damn, just be.
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs not love just because sometimes you want space.
Well. That‚Äôs scary.
Y u tryin so hard? Loving isn‚Äôt ‚Äúimpressing.‚Äù
Healthy love doesn‚Äôt involve fear of loss. That‚Äôs attachment.
It also doesn‚Äôt involve fear of ‚Äúnever being with another woman.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know what that is. Low self esteem? Lack of conviction?
This is attachment again, not mature love.
This is self-love, not love. (Also: you‚Äôre an idiot.)
Well. Glad you‚Äôre getting your emotional needs met.
But this just means that they are deserving of love. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you are loving them.
Well. Thanks for the most unhelpful advice ever.
To everyone who‚Äôs ever said this: y tho? pls stahp.
Don‚Äôt perpetuate nonsense and call it ‚Äúromance‚Äù just because you don‚Äôt have suitable answers.
The difference here is probably what the rest of your day looks like.
Good: If you‚Äôre happy with your life and your partner adds to it, then congrats. You win.
Bad: If you‚Äôre unhappy and using your partner as an oasis, then you need to get your shit together.
Good: you actually care about their wants and needs, and prioritize them in a way that doesn‚Äôt tear you down
Bad: you compromise your own wants and needs, or base your value on your ability to ‚Äúkeep them happy.‚Äù
Rad for them
Congrats, there may be hope for you yet.
Great. I want happiness for most people.
You found someone with whom you‚Äôre comfortable, and whose company you enjoy. Good on you.
Role models have that effect on us, too. That doesn‚Äôt mean we love them.
You don‚Äôt feel love. You DO it. It‚Äôs an act, not a feeling. It‚Äôs a moment by moment decision and re-commitment. You know because it‚Äôs deliberate and conscious.
You invest. You exert effort.
You don‚Äôt knowingly do harm. You aren‚Äôt vengeful, petty, manipulative, or jealous. Their needs never seem irritating. You aren‚Äôt grabby with them, their time, or their affection in return. You are secure without demanding constant reassurance.
You prioritize their viewpoints. You learn their love language. You think in terms of their interests, not yours, and their needs are your own. You support them. You back them. You care and take care. You accept, and you allow.
Because everyone thinks they‚Äôre in love when it‚Äôs clear skies and calm waters, but watch them when the storm hits.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre pissed. It‚Äôs love if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúfight;‚Äù you disagree.
You love if your objective is reaching an agreement, not picking a winner.
You love if you don‚Äôt get defensive, insecure, or manipulative. If you don‚Äôt keep score. If you don‚Äôt hold grudges. If you don‚Äôt ‚Äútake back your love‚Äù as punishment.
You love if you seek to understand before being understood; listen and honor what they share ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt double down with your own issues. If you act like you‚Äôre on the same team. You listen. You compromise. You apologize. You forgive.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre hurt. Especially honoring and respecting their wants and needs even when they include ‚Äúbreaking up.‚Äù
We like to differentiate between ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù and ‚Äúloving‚Äù someone. But ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù is infatuation, and infatuation means nothing in getting real love.
So if what you want is real love, then ‚Äúhow to‚Äù is all that matters.
You ‚Äúknow‚Äù because you decide. It‚Äôs love when you do it. All the time.

Jessica Rosales|3.6K|3|https://psiloveyou.xyz/how-do-we-know-when-to-give-up-on-a-relationship-ef25bb6333d5?source=---------7---------------------|How do we know when to give up on a relationship? ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"‚ÄúWhy are you giving up on us so soon?‚Äù my boyfriend asked me.
I was taken aback.
The thought of breaking up entered my mind long before we had this conversation. I had so many doubts about him and our relationship. He was impatient, belligerent, and refused to back down from a fight, even if he was the one at fault. He had a terrible temper that flared up at the smallest of provocations. And no matter how gently (i.e. non-aggressively) I touched on a problem or issue, it was almost always met with hostility ‚Äî hostility that I didn‚Äôt deserve.
I responded to his aggression with patience, and I countered his hostility with reason.
It wasn‚Äôt easy; it takes a lot of energy to be patient with someone who has wronged you yet refuses to acknowledge their faults.
His aggression was slowly chipping away at me, but I remained hopeful he would change. And while I did see some improvements here and there, they were temporary and minor; they didn‚Äôt last and they never actually resolved the bigger issues. (Band-aids on bullet holes, if you will.)
I no longer had the mental and emotional capacity to indulge his aggression. I raised my voice. I got angry. I fought back. And he could not, for the life of him, return the patience and understanding I had shown him all those times. It was then that I realized I was fighting an uphill battle all on my own.
Despite this, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder: Could he still change? Could we still get this relationship to work? Maybe with a little more time and effort...
And then it hit me.
Time and time again, he pleaded for another chance ‚Äî he promised he would change his ways, make amends, and do right by me. But time and time again, he did not deliver on those promises. We were stuck in a never-ending cycle of ‚Äúsecond chances,‚Äù one that I perpetuated by granting him chances that he didn‚Äôt deserve. I felt like I was hanging onto the ledge of a building that was about to crumble down.
If he wanted the relationship to work out, things would have changed by then, but they didn‚Äôt.
Could he have still changed for the sake of the relationship? Up until the very last moments preceding the breakup, I honestly wasn‚Äôt sure. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to predict what someone is capable of doing when given a second chance ‚Äî I still believed he could have changed.
At my core, I knew that I had given it my all. And if that wasn‚Äôt enough, then at least I can move forward without any regrets.
Was I giving up too soon? In retrospect, I wonder why I hadn‚Äôt given up sooner.

John Gorman|20K|7|https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-art-of-intimacy-75bd969f6b4b?source=---------9---------------------|The Art of Intimacy ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"Some time ago, I read ‚ÄúThe Opposite of Loneliness,‚Äù by Marina Keegan, a 22 year-old writing prodigy, killed in a car accident upon graduation from Yale University. She opened her award-winning essay, which spawned an extraordinary, posthumous bestselling book of the same name, with perhaps the most succinct distillation of human suffering ever articulated in print.
There are two profound tragedies of the human condition: Loneliness is one. Impermanence is the other. Loneliness is a tragedy of space. Impermanence is a tragedy of time. Humans are felled by their bodies ‚Äî prisons that confine us to only where and when we exist. Today, we‚Äôll focus exclusively on trying to subvert loneliness. We‚Äôll explore loneliness in an attempt to find its ‚Äúopposite.‚Äù
To find the word for the opposite of loneliness, we first need to define the word itself. Loneliness is commonly articulated as the sensational byproduct of being physically, mentally or emotionally alone. For example, if you had moved to a new city, or started a new job, and maybe the others would initially look at you like you‚Äôd grown a second head, as a curious interloper from another planet thrust into a foreign culture. That‚Äôs almost loneliness, but still not quite right. Real loneliness runs deeper than that. It‚Äôs feeling alone even when you aren‚Äôt actually alone.
Have you ever had the overwhelming sense of being alone, despite a venerable cornucopia of people you could call to knock back a cocktail or 12? Do you, perhaps, go out, and then stumble home at 3 a.m. and choke half to death on your own self-loathing? Each early morning ending exactly as the day began, no closer to those you‚Äôd gallivanted around with, and your cat silently judging you, while your friends text you and say ‚ÄúMan, that shit was epic?‚Äù Yet you still feel apart? Grand loneliness can arrive cloaked in a long con of community. Succinctly: Loneliness isn‚Äôt feeling like you don‚Äôt really know anybody. It‚Äôs feeling like nobody could ever really know you. How does this manifest itself?
When you‚Äôre with people, you speak and receive faint nods of approval, off-hand laughter, and pithy responses to zingers or outside-the-box thoughts. You might share a common ground, a common goal or a common interest. You disperse to bond another day. And yet you‚Äôre still left wondering why it isn‚Äôt clicking. You may describe your relationship with the world as a car in second gear, a fire-hose bulging and bursting from the inside-out, yet a mere mist when sprayed at its target. Loneliness is an unfulfilled desire for connection with others, a loathing and resignation that‚Äôs directed inward ... the electrical voltage that sparks connection reversed and turned upon itself, paralyzing you the way a Taser would. You‚Äôve watched your authentic self wall itself off from others; the communication with the outside world is tense and terse.
Guarded sharing is risk mitigation applied to social settings. It‚Äôs a series of quick-win verbal habits that are designed to be snackable content IRL. Everyone loves a biting wit, a compliment or good news. Bring enough of it to enough people and you‚Äôll make them feel warm and fuzzy all over. These are oral slap-singles, and they‚Äôre nearly a bulletproof way to be likable. Maybe you‚Äôve done this. I‚Äôve done this often. In fact ... it is my default setting. Make people smile and laugh and then vanish into the ether.
I don‚Äôt suppose I need to tell you this makes me a hit at parties, and also, surprisingly awkward. And here‚Äôs the stinging truth: A lot of likable people are completely lonely. Picture a homeless man who smiles, says ‚ÄúI love that shirt,‚Äù and wishes you ‚Äúa blessed day‚Äù before retreating to the solace of his overpass shelter. And you can also see examples of this scrolling through your your apps.
Let‚Äôs talk about social media for a minute. We craft these burgeoning social networks, and (supposedly) gleefully over-share in the hopes that somebody, anybody, will relate to us. Perhaps you‚Äôve widened your network to one, two, three thousand people that you consider friends, or sought out an avalanche of hearts and likes on a professionally candid photo, or a status that doubles as an epic depiction of your success, or a meme articulating distrust of the government. Perhaps you‚Äôve occasionally received that validation and it momentarily made you feel less lonely inside. Perhaps the words and pictures were so good and rang so true that they could not, nor shall not, be ignored.
But when all reaction is currency, and all reaction is cursory, self-loathing and self-doubt and the other two horsemen of the self-pocalypse ride into our virtual town. What your writing and posting and taste in YouTube videos say about you is, ultimately, that you‚Äôre worth listening to. I‚Äôve experienced this on Facebook, in response to cross-posting my many Medium pieces. But is that a precursor for becoming less lonely?
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so vulnerable,‚Äù my friends would tell me. ‚ÄúIt takes so much strength, courage and guts to bleed onto the keyboard for all to see.‚Äù
Ahhh ... but the masses have been duped. For what I share with anyone isn‚Äôt indicative of any sort of emotional vulnerability. I am broadcasting ‚Äî a far less personal or emotionally risky endeavor than conversation. Broadcasting things may make you someone worth listening to, but only conversation can confirm to people that you‚Äôre someone worth truly knowing. Those two ideas, and those two classes of people, are poles apart. Becoming someone worth knowing requires reciprocity and vulnerability. It requires actual investment of emotional capital into people you wish to know. And there‚Äôs only a fixed amount allotted for distribution, in a deeper way than taking 15 seconds to ‚Äúlike‚Äù and comment, anyway.
Keeping up an actual friendship requires resources. To be someone worth knowing requires real human interaction: conversing beyond quips and quick-hits, seeing and sharing activities beyond Buzzfeed links, expressing differences, changing minds, passionately defending the points that define our character, coming through when it matters, asking for (and offering) favors. This is what makes this life worth living. When we‚Äôre lonely, what we‚Äôre really craving is more connecting, not more connections. Stumbling home after 3 a.m. exhausting every truth we have in our arsenal, armor laid at the feet of our social sparring partners. And that leads us back to the opposite of loneliness.
The opposite of loneliness is intimacy ‚Äî the act of revealing your whole self to someone else and having them reciprocate. It is something you can only do one-on-one, face-to-face, soul-to-soul. When we stop taking hacks at softball pitches and start swinging for the fences, our acts and ideas first clear, then crumble, the walls we‚Äôve built to protect ourselves. Intimacy is an act of love, an act of self-love, and an act of defiance all in one. It‚Äôs gritty, emotional, raw, unfiltered, unabashed, unpretentious and unguarded. It‚Äôs more than talking about things together. It‚Äôs being and becoming about things together.
For what are we in this world if not connectable, interlocking parts? What is this joy, suffering, talent and wisdom, if not to be shared and imparted? How much has gone wasted or unremedied due to our inability for intimacy, our own tight-lipped, tightly-wound tendencies? A soul is not a silo, a mind is not a mine. We worship, learn, aid, sing, watch, call, visit, fuck, create, talk, love, try, read and write to bring ourselves closer. To make whole what we lack in the emptiness of loneliness. Each deeper connection creates deeper character, with more room to grow, more to lose and more to become. A heart unbroken is a life unwagered. A dream undashed is a life unlived. To play safe, to play solo, is to play a fool‚Äôs game ‚Äî we may find success in rising above the rest, but we may only win by lifting up others. This requires intimacy. There are no workarounds.
Indeed, we‚Äôre only unburdened when we let our heart hang out the window to dry ‚Äî when we let it be warmed, broken, run over by a semi, lifted, toyed with, and embraced. Intimacy requires the courage to make enemies as easily as we make friends, and watch the world dare to stand with us.
This is how we beat back the gray twilight of loneliness and find ourselves in the company of those we‚Äôve challenged to truly see and accept us for who we are. It‚Äôs that feeling of two (or more!) human vessels for unchecked, unabashed, unmitigated joy reciprocating that truth, love and splendor between each other, a game of emotional and intellectual catch where neither drops the ball. It is the transcendence of body as prison, and it is the momentary defeat of our uniquely human tragedy.
We don‚Äôt have a word for that feeling yet, but if we did, I could say that‚Äôs what I want in life.

Lola Phoenix|7.6K|28|https://medium.com/@thelolaphoenix/thirteen-things-i-wish-id-learned-before-choosing-non-monogamy-ce3533cbd525?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|Thirteen things I wish I‚Äôd learned before choosing non-monogamy|"When you first learn about polyamory or non-monogamy, what most people call ‚Äòopen relationships‚Äô, you‚Äôll likely be directed to several publications: The Ethical Slut, Opening Up, and the website More Than Two. And these were things I read when I started my journey into non-monogamy.
Quickly I found though that there were several lessons I had to learn the hard way that these sources either didn‚Äôt teach me clearly enough or actually got in my way of learning these lessons.
So here are the 13 things I wish I‚Äôd learnt earlier about non-monogamy:
When you first start reading about non-monogamy, the emphasis on the unhealthiness of jealousy is drilled into you to the point where, at least for me, not being one of those jealous people you hear about that implode their own relationships by trying to control their partners‚Äô every move becomes your personal mission.
Beginner reading on non-monogamy over-hypes jealousy to the point where people go into non-monogamy assuming any negative feeling they have about a person their partner is dating is inherently jealousy and any attempt to express that feeling is automatically controlling, abusive behaviour.
In my first non-monogamous ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô, I had spoken to this guy for a year (I lived in the US, he in the UK and I was moving to the UK within a few months) when he suddenly began dating a person he‚Äôd never mentioned before. This person seemed relatively cool and similar to me so I offered to friend them on Facebook to get to know them. The guy immediately banned me from speaking to them on the grounds that he felt more comfortable with us talking in person first.
Given I was about to be in the UK in 6 months and I didn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòcontrolling‚Äô, I obliged. He said he‚Äôd told this person about me, even that they wanted to have a threesome with all of us. But unsurprisingly, he hadn‚Äôt so much as breathed a word to this person about me.
In hindsight, I never would have agreed to not speak to his new partner. That would have been a red flag. But I was so anxious to be seen as ‚Äòjealous‚Äô, I ignored my own feelings assuming they were monogamous baggage.
But they weren‚Äôt. Negative feelings are sometimes a result of your needs not being met. If your partner refuses to take you to your favourite restaurant and then takes someone new out on a date to that same restaurant, any rational human being is going to feel not so happy about that. Negative feelings and yes, even the scary green eyed monster of jealousy, can be justified and understandable.
What beginner sources of non-monogamy fail to communicate is that it‚Äôs not so much jealousy or negative feelings that are the problem ‚Äî it‚Äôs what we do with them that can make things implode.
When I started out in polyamorous communities, I was immediately drawn to those ‚Äòexperienced‚Äô people who seemed confident in what they were doing. Those people were not only attractive to me but seemed like the best bet. Obviously confident people communicate clearly, right? Obviously when you‚Äôre just starting out in something, someone who has. had loads of relationships and many partners is a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô bet, right?
Wrong.
Unfortunately, I found that confident people made me feel like I was being heard and listened to but that was rarely actually the case. Confident people can make you feel special and looked after, but when it actually comes time to devote emotional energy and resources to you, these people, in my experience, are rarely up for the task. Their ability to make you feel special is part of that confidence, but it isn‚Äôt actual human compassion you‚Äôre seeing.
Not to mention, just because someone has had many relationships, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre better at them. Relationships aren‚Äôt a game where playing gives you more experience. It‚Äôs about an individual exchange and if they have always come up a little short handed, it might be what is showing.
Another thing that beginner non-monogamous sources fail to really discuss is the fact that non-monogamous setups where an individual doesn‚Äôt spend a long time with any one individual but sees them rarely can allow for people who would normally be toxic and difficult to be around to have plenty of ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô relationships. If you only see someone once every two weeks and your time with them is great, you don‚Äôt necessarily see or have to deal with some of the more dubious aspects of their personality.
So sometimes having more partners than you know what to do with isn‚Äôt inherently a sign that you‚Äôre amazing at non-monogamy and beginners shouldn‚Äôt assume so.
Most relationship advice for anyone regardless of relationship style often boils down to this: Talk to your partner.
Like most advice, it‚Äôs much easier to give than it is to follow. And what non-monogamous beginner resources fail to really take into account is that communication is actually really really hard, but not for the reasons they assume.
As an autistic person, recognising my own emotions and understanding them can be really difficult. As a person with an anxiety disorder, my immediate response to my own fear is to not take it seriously or examine it with a fine toothed comb. And when embarking on something that you‚Äôre completely new to, sometimes you don‚Äôt really know or understand what you need until you‚Äôre not getting it and it hurts.
Pain is the body‚Äôs way of telling us something is wrong. And sometimes you have to experience emotional pain before you really understand that you have a boundary or you have a need that isn‚Äôt being met.
But admitting to your partner that you have a need can be an extremely emotionally vulnerable place. Most beginner non-monogamous resources are written, usually, by white people who more likely than not come from a specific socio-economic background. It‚Äôs not to say that white middle class people never have any problems, but I usually find that if you‚Äôve been treated poorly systemically by society or have a history of being abused, it can be really difficult to feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable with anyone.
I found myself in my relationships trying to manipulate situations so that I got what I really wanted without having to ask for it because asking directly for something you need and being told by someone you care for greatly that they refuse to do it is absolutely gut-wrenchingly horrifying. And the greater my need for any one thing, the less likely I was to ask directly for it.
Imagine if you were heading to a funeral at the same time your partner wanted to go to an event that they were excited about. Imagine asking directly for your partner to be there for you at the funeral and having your partner either say no to you or seeing them huff at the idea of supporting you in a vulnerable place in your life. Even if it‚Äôs not directly a cause for breakup, having such an important need be either not met or complained about by your partner can damage the intimacy you feel with them. If you can‚Äôt be vulnerable and ask for help from them... then it begs the question of what your partnership is.
Talking to your partner is scary. Asking for something you need is scary. And especially because we live in a society that encourages us all to be independent beings that don‚Äôt need anybody, especially if you‚Äôve been encouraged by society to see yourself as ‚Äòclingy‚Äô or worry about being so, and especially because non-monogamous resources reinforce the idea that you shouldn‚Äôt need anyone too much, it can be that much harder to want anything from anybody.
I wrote about how a relationship is not a skill in great detail, but to summarise, I often believed, like many monogamous people even do, that breaking up or not having a good relationship was a bad reflection on myself.
The reason I said above that having loads of relationships isn‚Äôt inherently a sign of someone good at relationships is because likewise having a bunch of exes isn‚Äôt necessarily a sign of being ‚Äòbad‚Äô at relationships either. It feels like non-monogamous communities especially encourage the idea that un-amicable breakups and ‚Äòdrama‚Äô are a sign of people just being bad at relationships. And therefore some of the confident people I mention might have loads of relationships, but a lot of quiet exes.
The aforementioned guy who suddenly ended up dating someone new and forbade me to speak to them ended up being a jerk outside of this and when I confronted him on it, blocked me on all forms of social media. I was tempted after this to tell his other partner about him blocking me on everything when confronted because I had come out of my haze and also had the sneaking suspicion that they knew nothing about me ‚Äî but avoided doing so for fear of looking like the ‚Äòjealous and crazy ex‚Äô.
And I think many people who have poor experiences with people are so ashamed that their relationship has ‚Äòfailed‚Äô they think it‚Äôs due to their lack of skill, or they are worried it will appear so, that they keep mum even when they think the person they dated is particularly toxic or abusive. No one wants to start ‚Äòdrama‚Äô or be seen as ‚Äòbad at relationships‚Äô.
But relationships are not skills. They are partnerships and co-ops. And just like getting in a car accident doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre inherently a bad driver, ending a relationship or having to end it doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre bad at relationships. There are relationship skills you can certainly improve like communication and compassion.
You can be really good at knowing your own boundaries or not so good. But ultimately sometimes you can‚Äôt be good enough for two people and sometimes two people, as nice and as great at they are at communicating, just don‚Äôt fit that well together.
Maybe if people saw breaking up less as a sign that someone is ‚Äòbad‚Äô at something, people would be less worried about looking like a ‚Äòbad ex‚Äô.
I‚Äôd read so much information about non-monogamy before I started that I felt like I knew exactly how to handle things. And my first experience being negative, I approached things with a sense that I‚Äôd even learned well from that. One of the things I insisted on after my first experience was trying to be friends with my partner‚Äôs partners.
You will often hear ‚Äòthere is no one right way to do polyamory‚Äô as a beginner and yet you will hear about ‚Äòcompersion‚Äô, which is meant to be the opposite of jealousy, whereby you hear about your partner having a good date or a good time with someone and you‚Äôre filled with happiness and feel glad for them.
Although people say there is no one right way, an ideal is communicated through this and many attitudes. The ‚Äòbest‚Äô way to do non-monogamy is clearly one where you experience ‚Äòcompersion‚Äô, no jealousy, no negative emotions, and never have any problems.
And this level of happiness is not expected within monogamy. In fact, in monogamy an unhappy marriage is almost expected. Countless male identified comedians have made entire careers over the idea that marriage and sexual monogamy is the end of their ‚Äòfun‚Äô and although monogamy (read: heterosexual, white monogamy) is a standard encouraged by this society, the idea that it‚Äôs not a picnic and not always fun and happy is also something that‚Äôs widely accepted.
And yet, non-monogamous people, because people so often blame a failed open relationship on opening it up in the first place and assume that it fails because non-monogamous relationships don‚Äôt work, are often so encouraged to be good PR for the non-monogamy community that they are expected to attain a level of relationship happiness monogamous people never have to match up to.
And this is an expectation reinforced within communities without monogamous people present. I‚Äôve seen countless people in polyamorous communities feel so anxious by the idea that their forum is filled with people confused and asking for help that they post positive and happy stories to almost reassure the outside world. Monogamous people are allowed to be unhappy and that not reflect badly on monogamy necessarily, but non-monogamous people, not so.
This pressure on me to be happy with my partner‚Äôs other relationships and to be friends with metamours (the people your partner dates) made me anxious and unhappy. I forced myself to socially interact with people beyond my personal means.
I forced myself to be friends with people I had nothing in common with and it made me sarcastic towards them. Instead of just accepting that maybe I don‚Äôt really need to be friends with metamours, I forced myself into it which inevitably made the situation tense and difficult anyways.
Furthermore, I felt like my indifference to my partner‚Äôs romantic exploits made me heartless and even somehow ‚Äòjealous‚Äô. And in fact, listening to details of my partner‚Äôs exploits stood my hair on end ‚Äî not because I was jealous or bothered ‚Äî but because the fear that I would become jealous was so intense it made me just as uncomfortable as jealousy would ‚Äî maybe even MORE uncomfortable. I would only realise later that my discomfort in being a voyeur had a lot to do with the sexual abuse I‚Äôd survived and nothing to do with feeling jealous at all.
I had to accept that compersion just might not be something I felt and hearing the details just made me anxious about being jealous ‚Äî and that was okay. I didn‚Äôt have to feel compersion to be happy for my partner on a wider scale. And I didn‚Äôt have to get along with or even like my metamours for things to be okay between any partner I had. Obviously, yeah, if we were to be friendly and when I am friendly with a metamor it is nice... but forcing myself to be friends with anyone in any situation is never comfortable and that‚Äôs just fine.
Compersion isn‚Äôt compulsory.
Non-monogamous beginners hear multiple times a day that ‚Äòlove is infinite‚Äô and it‚Äôs not necessarily wrong. While you may be able to love an infinite number of people, you only have so much energy in a day. As a person with a disability that affects my energy levels and social anxiety, I quickly realised that going out on a new date every night wasn‚Äôt something that I could physically do, and that‚Äôs okay.
I also found that a lot of people who espoused a ‚Äòlove is infinite‚Äô philosophy had many privileges they took for granted that I didn‚Äôt have. They had careers (or the ability to live fine without one) with flexible time options, the money to spend on activities, the mental and physical energy to socially interact with people without going to a breaking point.
One time I can recall, I went to an open relationships event in a new city and the conference involved a lot of intense interpersonal social interaction. After being invited to a party, I accepted, despite being exhausted. I ended up in a very loud, strange, unfamiliar house without any proper place to sit away from the huge crowds of people and became so sensory overloaded, I ended up crying. I felt ridiculous, un-fun, ashamed of my inability to go with the flow of everyone else until I eventually realised that my resourses just weren‚Äôt where others were.
You can love however many people you want, but there are only 24 hours in a day. Not all of us can afford to live within walking distance of all of our partners or afford a job that doesn‚Äôt run us ragged most of the week. It would be great if time and resources were as infinite as love, but they just aren‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs helpful to realise that.
As I mentioned before, there is an unhealthy expectation on non-monogamous people to be happy about everything going on within their relationships. You‚Äôre put under this expectation, especially due to some of the beginner material you read, to enjoy every aspect of non-monogamy, to be fine with all of the activities your partners have with others, and to be fine on your own.
But sometimes, you can be lonely ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay. Sometimes when my partner who lives with me is out visiting someone else I may in theory be very happy for them, but I am alone at present. And sure, I have found out the best way to resolve this issue is to try and make plans at the same time so I have company, but that‚Äôs not always possible.
Time isn‚Äôt infinite, as I said before, and ultimately agreeing to a non-monogamous relationship means agreeing to a relationship structure where any individual you partner with does not and cannot reasonably spend all of their time with you.
Monogamy also has this type of setup when one partner has a time consuming job like being a lawyer or doctor. But within non-monogamy it‚Äôs guarantee that part and parcel of what you‚Äôre agreeing to is for your partner to not devote all of their time and energies towards you.
And this can get lonely. Especially if you‚Äôre in the very likely scenario that one person has loads of dates and the other doesn‚Äôt. It can get sad. And I think we spend so much time trying to stay happy for our partner that we shove this loneliness down, don‚Äôt talk about it, and then it ends up blowing up in our faces. Especially given the polyamorous community crab bucket mentality of, ‚Äòoh no, there‚Äôs to many stories about people struggling with non-monogamy, let‚Äôs talk about how awesome it is‚Äô.
Statistically, the more relationships you have the more likely it is for you to encounter heartbreak. And although that is a hazard of the trade, it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to pretend like you‚Äôre not heartbroken if and when you are or that you‚Äôre not scared of it.
Sometimes it‚Äôs not awesome. Sometimes you‚Äôre lonely. The important thing to remember in this case is the benefits you ultimately get out of non-monogamy as a choice and to take steps to try and handle that loneliness. Steps that acknowledge and recognise your feelings rather than shoving a grin on your face and trying to feel okay with it all. Because eventually, if our partners aren‚Äôt spending enough time with us for us to be happy, we won‚Äôt actually be able to realise that if we‚Äôre trying our best to not be unhappy and lying to ourselves about it.
Monogamy, specifically heterosexual monogamy, is encouraged by the society we live in. And when you‚Äôre just starting out having open relationships, you can feel a bit isolated. You will have experiences where people will judge you for it (specifically if you‚Äôre read as female) and a lot of times people can feel this combination where they are shunned by society, admired by some while simultaneously feeling that what they are doing is ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô.
You get a lot of mixed messages as a beginner in non-monogamous communities: It‚Äôs more natural than monogamy and yet it‚Äôs scorned and hated and yet it‚Äôs seen as ‚Äòcool‚Äô and ‚Äòhip‚Äô. And that in turn can make things somewhat confusing, especially when the same sorts of conventions you see in monogamy seem to be still at play within non-monogamy.
For example, in a lot of non-monogamous settings I know, I see a lot of self-identified women in polyamorous families doing the majority of the child rearing or sharing child rearing between women partners while the men go out and do what they‚Äôd like. I see a lot of women stretching themselves providing emotional support for multiple people and getting nothing for themselves. I see a lot of situations where older men are using non-monogamy as an example of their ‚Äòfeminism‚Äô, dating multiple people who are much younger than they are and no one in their actual age bracket. You‚Äôll find a lot of convention within unconventionality.
Also, I find that people tend to have selective memories about history. Even within monogamous people, you have this concept that 50s era 2.5 kids with picket fences zeitgeist family is ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô and has been happening for years and years ‚Äî but this just isn‚Äôt true.
Romantic love and the idea that it‚Äôs not a sickness that needs to be cured is a relatively new idea in human history. Marriage being a symbol of love and not an exchange of property between families is a relatively new idea. Partnerships in life in decades past were not usually about love and sex, they were about wealth and power.
And in some cases even today people practice arranged marriage situations which aren‚Äôt necessarily problematic whereby a marriage is secured and a partnership forms out of a common need rather than what we would consider ‚Äòtypical‚Äô now of two individuals meeting and falling in love.
And ‚Äòaffairs‚Äô have not historically been a problem. Having multiple ‚Äòpartners‚Äô within socially sanctioned monogamy has been possible for wealthy men for hundreds of years. Maybe someone had a ‚Äòmarriage‚Äô, but that has never always meant sexual exclusivity. Or even if it has, that sexual exclusivity has purely been imposed on the person read as a woman within that exchange ‚Äî but very rarely for the men.
Not to mention, so many beginner non-monogmous guides are written from the perspective that the nuclear family was a reality for all of the individuals reading it while many poor and immigrant individuals may have never had that experience or expectation. Living jointly with family members, especially elders, is a common practice for a lot of people. So this idea that non-monogamy is defying all of the traditional conventions... well, it just isn‚Äôt.
Which is not to say feelings of loneliness aren‚Äôt valid or that there aren‚Äôt people who genuinely will dislike you for being non-monogamous. I will say though that ‚Äòopen relationships‚Äô aren‚Äôt necessarily completely unknown to mainstream culture and although there may be many misconceptions about them, there is yet to be a slur developed specifically for non-monogamous people.
And in my experience the vast majority of individuals who experience negative consequences for dating multiple people tend to be experiencing those consequences because they are read as women. People read as men can be judged by other men for ‚Äúallowing‚Äù their wives to sleep with other men, but this isn‚Äôt an anti-male consequence as the roots of this judgement stem from the idea that men need to be sexually dominant of the women they date and that women are subduing men by owning their own sexuality ‚Äî which is misogyny and ultimately about putting women back in their place, not about hating men or open relationships.
So the point of this is that, even while non-monogamy may be ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô, there are still plenty old conventional habits that pop up within it.
Eurocentric/white societies in general reinforce the idea of the individual as more important. We are encouraged in many ways to shine on our own, pull ourselves up by our ‚Äòbootstraps‚Äô, and not rely on others for help. Within non-monogamy, the reinforcement of the idea of being independent and allowing your partners to have independence means you often have this concept re-ingrained into you.
The advice so often given to beginners about jealousy is that they have to work it out themselves. In many cases, I find myself trying to handle everything on my own because I am worried about not only being a burden to my partners but also worried about making them feel I rely on them too much. I‚Äôve been encouraged to be self-sufficient to the point where asking for help becomes really difficult.
Sometimes it feels like it‚Äôs so not okay to have needs of your own, especially emotional ones, that it becomes another obstacle in asking for what you need. Because you don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòclingy‚Äô or be seen in a negative light within non-monogamy. Where monogamy is often characterised as unhealthy co-dependence, anything that seems to echo or reflect that can often be seen as just as negative. And when your relationships aren‚Äôt following an already culturally defined script of boundaries and what means what, you‚Äôre often left wondering who you can really ask for emotional support.
No one is actually an island though. We‚Äôre social creatures, even me who‚Äôs about as un-social as you can get. Sometimes we need help. And the people we feel comfortable enough to be romantic with are sometimes the people we feel safe asking for help from, moreso than others. And that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not clingy to have needs. And while your partners may not be your therapists and relying on any one individual for all of your emotional support may not be fair, ultimately you can‚Äôt help the things that you need. And pretending like you can take care of yourself all alone isn‚Äôt actually going to work.
When I first started out within non-monogamous communities, I was, like most people, nervous and hopeful I would make a good impression. I also had a bit of rose tinted glasses, hoping to be around people who understood me and the choices I wanted to make. I barely recognised until it was a little too late that the communities that I particularly entered were full of people who had completely different life experiences than me.
Some communities of non-monogamous people, and indeed many other communities you‚Äôll find, aren‚Äôt always the most diverse places and that can often leave you comparing yourself and your life to people who just don‚Äôt share the same experiences and understanding as you.
In my experience, feeling like I was the only non-binary person for example, was harsh. My feelings about being misgendered were often dismissed and glossed over. I‚Äôve heard within a meeting of non-monogamous people that polyamorous people just don‚Äôt have the time to concern themselves about transphobia and transmisogyny because they‚Äôre too busy with other things.
Diverse non-monogamous communities exist, but you have to sometimes go looking for them. If you find yourself feeling a bit isolated in yours, that may be for a reason. Take a look around and ask yourself if the only thing you really have in common is non-monogamy and if that‚Äôs actually going to hinder you instead of helping you.
If jealousy is the scarlet ‚ÄòJ‚Äô of non-monogamy, then insecurity is definitely its horrible cousin. People often will advise newcomers to work on their insecurities, to challenge them and to reassure themselves that they are worthy and worthwhile.
And this approach... might work. But what so many non-monogamy beginner guides leave out is the idea that being insecure can be a completely logical reaction to a given scenario and they very often assume insecurity is self-hate, when the two are not one in the same.
Insecurity is just that ‚Äî a lack of feeling secure. And when you‚Äôre starting a new relationship with someone, you may feel very insecure about the relationship and what you mean to each other. That makes a lot of sense. Feeling insecure in that situation doesn‚Äôt mean you assume that the person you‚Äôre starting the relationship with doesn‚Äôt like you, but that you‚Äôre not feeling secure about your relationship.
Likewise, I‚Äôve seen so many situations where people are kicking themselves for feeling insecure in a relationship (and ‚Äòjealous‚Äô) when it‚Äôs totally rational for them to feel insecure.
For example, say one partner has repeatedly broken promises to the other and then found a new hookup and the other partner is insecure about the new hookup. And the entire reason for that is because their relationship isn‚Äôt stable. If you have a partner who is not doing anything to make you feel valued and wanted or is in fact proving that you aren‚Äôt valued through action, you can tell yourself how awesome you are all you‚Äôd like ‚Äî it still won‚Äôt solve the actual problem or insecurity.
Insecurity isn‚Äôt something that happens always because you hate yourself or you think you‚Äôre unworthy. An Olympic athlete could feel insecure about their performance but still understand that their athletic performance is above average. Someone can have 50 Oscars for their acting work but still feel insecure when they go to an audition. We fear the unknown. We fear bad things happening. And that fear can cause insecurity. And we often mistake fear and insecurity for jealousy when it isn‚Äôt.
Self-hate is when you tell yourself that you‚Äôre not good enough, that your partners secretly hate you, and all of the other negative things that people sometimes experience. And the solution to this is to try and talk to yourself positively and stop attacking yourself. And self-hate can and does indeed cause you to feel insecure in a lot of things, relationships included. But not all insecurity is caused by self-hate.
It‚Äôs complicated because if your partner, for example, is neglecting you, you may hate yourself for feeling like you need more time with them. You may talk yourself down and say that you‚Äôre too clingy, too needy and that you need to pull yourself together. But maybe your partner isn‚Äôt actually spending as much time as you as an individual need from them. Maybe your partner missed an important birthday.
So you may feel temporarily better by trying to remind yourself of how much you are loved and how much you matter... but if your partner is neglecting you and not meeting the needs you have, you‚Äôre just going to be stuck in a cycle of just trying to stay afloat. Assuming your problems are all insecurity that needs to be dealt with by you reassuring yourself and not an inherent problem within the relationship of an unmet need or even neglect will just cause you to stay trapped in this cycle forever.
Don‚Äôt assume that your insecurity is always about self-hate. Sometimes it‚Äôs a sign that your needs aren‚Äôt being met. And even though not all people have the same needs and maybe you do in fact need more than others in some situations, if your relationships are going to work, your partners need to be willing to meet those needs if they can.
You may have to come to the conclusion that you‚Äôre not as compatible as you‚Äôd like to be, but it‚Äôs better to come to that conclusion than to perpetuate a relationship where you, at the end of the day, aren‚Äôt getting what you want and instead are just trying to pep talk your way through it.
‚ÄòI don‚Äôt need no stinkin‚Äô rules‚Äô, as you might have heard. Also hierarchies where you have a primary partner reflect non-monogamy and end up giving ‚Äòcouples privilege‚Äô to two people, hurting the secondary. All of this is bad, bad, bad, baaaaaad.
Except not.
It‚Äôs ironic how many people who say they don‚Äôt need rules expect their partners to practice safe sexual practices as a rule, but somehow don‚Äôt seem to see using barriers and getting tested as ‚Äòrule‚Äô, but instead ‚Äòcommon sense‚Äô. And yet an individual‚Äôs idea of what is ‚Äòrisky‚Äô sex can really vary wildly between people.
Especially given how so many people are just uninformed about sexual health risk that they are unaware that STI transmission is STILL possible, even using condoms. One of the reasons sex educators are saying ‚Äòsafer‚Äô sex instead of ‚Äòsafe‚Äô sex is precisely because of that misunderstanding.
I tend to take the Jack Sparrow approach to non-monogamy. The only rules that matter are these: What you can do and what you can‚Äôt do.
I can let my partners date whomever they like, but I can‚Äôt say that if they were to date someone who‚Äôs been abusive and nasty to me it wouldn‚Äôt affect my feelings towards them.
I can let my partners do whatever they‚Äôd like, but I can‚Äôt pretend like missing my birthday or something that‚Äôs important to me wouldn‚Äôt make me upset.
I can let my partners define their own boundaries, but I can‚Äôt, for example, see my partner abuse or hurt someone else and pretend like I‚Äôm fine with that.
Everyone has individual needs within their relationships, and that goes for all things. Any parent would tell you that each kid they have (or even teacher) is different, each individual needing different things. Sometimes you need different things from different people, but those needs become your boundaries and things that you want to deal with.
And part of the reason rules and hierarchies aren‚Äôt inherently bad is because they can help support those needs ‚Äî so long as you aren‚Äôt trying to control the uncontrollable.
So for example, I enjoy doing domestic things with partners. I prefer to have a partner who lives with me and where we establish a life together, maybe by getting a house together. The ideal type of non-monogamy that works for me is one where I have a ‚Äòprimary‚Äô partner I can trust to ask for emotional support and where I have other partners who are more casual and who would give the same amount of emotional support I would expect a friend to give me. This is what works for me and more or less is what works for my primary partner, which is why we have that type of relationship.
My partner does have more of a drive for casual relationships whereas I‚Äôm not as bothered if I don‚Äôt go out on a date for months. This is a situation that works for us both. And we communicate that to other people so we manage expectations. And in many cases, both in my experience as a primary partner and as a secondary who‚Äôs been discarded the moment I became inconvenient, having a clear understanding of expectations is what made things a lot better. Especially as an autistic person who needs clarity.
The problem with rules and hierarchies and why so much of the beginner non-monogamy advice will rail against them is because often people use rules and hierarchies to solve other problems that rules cannot solve.
You‚Äôll often find situations where one person has convinced their partner to do non-monogamy and they create a hierarchy and rules (e.g. you can‚Äôt sleep with someone until I say you can or we can‚Äôt have dates until both of us have one) to try and protect themselves against the fear of the unknown. And that‚Äôs understandable but the problem with rules is that the more you make, the more likely it will be that someone will forget and break one or that situations in life will create problems.
What beginner non-monogamy advice should do instead of unilaterally saying all rules and hierarchies are bad is instead expand on those rules which are likely to blow up in people‚Äôs faces.
For example, creating a rule that your partner has to check with you before sleeping with someone new is something I always advise against. Anything where one person gives ‚Äòpermission‚Äô creates a lot of pressure not only on the person giving permission to say yes to please their partner but also can create resentment if permission isn‚Äôt given.
And sometimes when casual situations arise, you may end up deciding to sleep with someone new at 1 AM in the morning, in which case telling your partner that you‚Äôre going to sleep with someone new could create more problems than it can solve, especially if your partner is having a rough day. Imagine missing your train, spilling your lunch, ruining an outfit, missing your partner, eating dinner alone and then being woken up at 1 AM by your partner calling to tell you they‚Äôre about sleep with someone else.
Yeah. Not so great.
The fear behind making this rule is an attempt to try and make sure that partners check in with each other to make sure they‚Äôre okay. And that doesn‚Äôt need to happen just before and can happen after. Instead of making a rule to enforce this kind of behaviour, what one should do is trying and create an atmosphere where your partner does check in with you, regardless of new partners or not, and makes sure your mental health is okay and where you feel comfortable telling your partner when it isn‚Äôt.
A rule enforced like this will not automatically create that type of atmosphere, so the rule isn‚Äôt going to help and may instead create more problems than it solves. I‚Äôd advise people to think about why they are making the rule and examine the reasoning behind it.
Last but not least, the advice so often not given to newbies is plainly: maybe non-monogamy just isn‚Äôt for you.
A lot of beginner non-monogamy writing is made with rose tinted eye implants, practically. Non-monogamy has a way of defying some of the things that are inherent but not exclusive to monogamy. Sometimes it can be freeing to feel like you can flirt without ‚Äòcheating‚Äô or do what you‚Äôd like. And that in turn makes people feel like non-monogamy is inherently better, inherently more egalitarian, inherently more socially progressive than monogamy.
And it can get to the point where non-monogamous people refer to monogamy derisively, almost blaming it instead of structures like misogyny and heterosexism for the way monogamy has kept them in a box.
That in turn can make people feel like the only egalitarian, ethical and socially progressive choice people can make IS non-monogamy. And like communism, non-monogamy can seem great on paper, but not work in practice for many people ‚Äî AND THAT IS OKAY.
As I said before, accepting non-monogamy means ultimately accepting that any one partner you have will not spend the entirety of their time and resources on you and visa versa. And maybe that‚Äôs not setup you want. Maybe that doesn‚Äôt work for you. Maybe having more people is just too complicated. Or maybe you‚Äôre just too damn tired to date more than one person.
All of this is okay. Choosing monogamy doesn‚Äôt mean you choose everything that society can tack on with it. Choosing monogamy doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll flip out if your partner notices someone else. It doesn‚Äôt mean you have a problem with your partner having sexual feelings or romantic feelings for someone else. Assuming that someone just being monogamous means they endorse society‚Äôs ideas about what monogamy should look like is a huge false equivalency.
That‚Äôs like me assuming as a non-binary person that any binary identified human being, trans or cis, automatically by identifying as a binary gender endorses everything that society tacks onto that gender ‚Äî and it‚Äôs just not true.
You may try non-monogamy and find it isn‚Äôt what you want, and that‚Äôs cool. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre backwards or want to live in the 50s. It may just mean it isn‚Äôt your cup of tea. And you‚Äôd think among ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô people, even that would be tolerated but sometimes it isn‚Äôt.
So that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm sure there will be more when I think about it some more, but for now, if I had known this before I started out, it would have saved me a lot of heartbreak and I‚Äôm hoping that for some beginners out there it helps them too.

Because it‚Äôs mostly shit advice.
Here‚Äôs a small sampling:
This is infatuation.
If someone‚Äôs ‚Äúalways‚Äù on your mind, you‚Äôre not focused on other Really Important Things. And that‚Äôs a problem.
Real love fits into real life, rather than usurping it. It‚Äôs calm, not overwhelming.
See above.
Ditto.
Well, I mean, damn. You fantasize long and hard enough, you can see anything in your future ‚Äî like I could imagine moving to Switzerland to be a goat farmer. That doesn‚Äôt mean I should.
The problem is that we‚Äôve made ‚Äúlove‚Äù into a game of escapism, and measure potential partners by how they fit into that fantasy. That‚Äôs not love.
So, sure, see them in your future ‚Äî but not because they ‚Äúcomplete the picture.‚Äù
See above.
Ha. Hahaha. Clearly you have never been in a (healthy) long-term relationship.
You should usually want to see bae. But love isn‚Äôt always wanting to. Sometimes you need a minute. Sometimes you need to work or do other things. Or, damn, just be.
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs not love just because sometimes you want space.
Well. That‚Äôs scary.
Y u tryin so hard? Loving isn‚Äôt ‚Äúimpressing.‚Äù
Healthy love doesn‚Äôt involve fear of loss. That‚Äôs attachment.
It also doesn‚Äôt involve fear of ‚Äúnever being with another woman.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know what that is. Low self esteem? Lack of conviction?
This is attachment again, not mature love.
This is self-love, not love. (Also: you‚Äôre an idiot.)
Well. Glad you‚Äôre getting your emotional needs met.
But this just means that they are deserving of love. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you are loving them.
Well. Thanks for the most unhelpful advice ever.
To everyone who‚Äôs ever said this: y tho? pls stahp.
Don‚Äôt perpetuate nonsense and call it ‚Äúromance‚Äù just because you don‚Äôt have suitable answers.
The difference here is probably what the rest of your day looks like.
Good: If you‚Äôre happy with your life and your partner adds to it, then congrats. You win.
Bad: If you‚Äôre unhappy and using your partner as an oasis, then you need to get your shit together.
Good: you actually care about their wants and needs, and prioritize them in a way that doesn‚Äôt tear you down
Bad: you compromise your own wants and needs, or base your value on your ability to ‚Äúkeep them happy.‚Äù
Rad for them
Congrats, there may be hope for you yet.
Great. I want happiness for most people.
You found someone with whom you‚Äôre comfortable, and whose company you enjoy. Good on you.
Role models have that effect on us, too. That doesn‚Äôt mean we love them.
You don‚Äôt feel love. You DO it. It‚Äôs an act, not a feeling. It‚Äôs a moment by moment decision and re-commitment. You know because it‚Äôs deliberate and conscious.
You invest. You exert effort.
You don‚Äôt knowingly do harm. You aren‚Äôt vengeful, petty, manipulative, or jealous. Their needs never seem irritating. You aren‚Äôt grabby with them, their time, or their affection in return. You are secure without demanding constant reassurance.
You prioritize their viewpoints. You learn their love language. You think in terms of their interests, not yours, and their needs are your own. You support them. You back them. You care and take care. You accept, and you allow.
Because everyone thinks they‚Äôre in love when it‚Äôs clear skies and calm waters, but watch them when the storm hits.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre pissed. It‚Äôs love if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúfight;‚Äù you disagree.
You love if your objective is reaching an agreement, not picking a winner.
You love if you don‚Äôt get defensive, insecure, or manipulative. If you don‚Äôt keep score. If you don‚Äôt hold grudges. If you don‚Äôt ‚Äútake back your love‚Äù as punishment.
You love if you seek to understand before being understood; listen and honor what they share ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt double down with your own issues. If you act like you‚Äôre on the same team. You listen. You compromise. You apologize. You forgive.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre hurt. Especially honoring and respecting their wants and needs even when they include ‚Äúbreaking up.‚Äù
We like to differentiate between ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù and ‚Äúloving‚Äù someone. But ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù is infatuation, and infatuation means nothing in getting real love.
So if what you want is real love, then ‚Äúhow to‚Äù is all that matters.
You ‚Äúknow‚Äù because you decide. It‚Äôs love when you do it. All the time.

John Gorman|162K|4|https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-3-keys-to-becoming-irresistible-d2f689ea4bf1?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|The 3 Keys to Becoming Irresistible ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"There‚Äôs a routine question asked in job interviews, first dates, table games and so on: What is the most important thing you look for in other people?
There‚Äôs variations on this format (i.e. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the most attractive quality you look for in a potential partner?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your greatest strength?‚Äù And so on) but, in general, the answer remains the same: The character trait you hold above all. When pressed, I‚Äôve often stumbled and resorted to something trite and probably not true: honesty, humor, confidence, charisma, etc. Those are fine answers but they‚Äôre not in my estimation the correct ones.
And so one day I sat down on my pleather couch, brewed some holy basil tea, queued up some Anderson Paak on the Spotify and really, truly tried to whittle down the essence of what makes truly admirable, special people exactly that. I analyzed people I looked up to, people I was attracted to, and people I just couldn‚Äôt dream to be without. And I found that the answer could never be just one thing, and that many of the things I think I admire are manifestations of other, deeper things I admire more. Here are the three components that, when taken together, create a spellbinding supernova of a person ‚Äî one who can command a room and control their destiny, one who can be both altruistic and intelligent. And so I give them to you and make a case for each.
This trait is the root of all growth, learning and kindness. It‚Äôs the belief that you are not yet so great that your mind cannot be opened, and it‚Äôs the presence of mind to remember that we are all interconnected equals, and that injustice against one is an injustice against all. It is, flatly, an absence of entitlement. People who exhibit humility let their work speak for itself, they remain stoic in the face of their own suffering, and they remind themselves ‚Äî and others ‚Äî that life is fragile and therefore valuable. Humility quells ignorance and cultivates grace. I want this in the people I hold dear.
Without curiosity, you cannot be enthralling or even engaging, nor ‚Äî most rudimentary of all ‚Äî successful. It is frankly impossible. Curiosity drives an insatiable quest for knowledge, culture, novelty, experience, beauty, art and connection. It is the bedrock upon which you can build a life filled with stories, memories, accomplishments and relationships. People who exhibit curiosity can become masters, or polymaths, or auteurs ‚Äî but they must first always have an open mind. They first seek to listen, to absorb, to immerse, to traverse. The world is too large and their time on it too short to ever remain fully satisfied in their pursuit of whatever new ideas pass in front of them. I want people around me to remain curious, routinely examining the world through fresh eyes, and using their eyes to find fresh corners of the world.
This trait is the miracle drug of humanity (and elephants, and dolphins). It is the simplest, sweetest attribute one can possess, and the most worthwhile one worth cultivating for social success. Empathy brings people closer, and makes others feel understood and less alone inside. And if there is one thing we‚Äôre all looking to become a little less of, it‚Äôs alone. When I see truly empathetic people, I see people who genuinely care, but also people who remind us that sometimes it‚Äôs okay to be still with someone else and not invade their space or encroach their boundaries. This unique ability to understand the world through others‚Äô eyes and cut to the heart of what others are feeling and experiencing. Empathy breeds compassion, connection and love. It is an important precursor for honesty.
You may have noticed the three are closely related. This is no mere accident. In fact, when you stack humility, curiosity and empathy, you can easily see how they amplify each other.
Humility is the soul. Curiosity is the mind. Empathy is the heart.
Humility is how you value yourself. Curiosity is how you value your others. Empathy is how you value the bonds between yourself and others.
Humility is the soil of knowledge. Curiosity is the water that helps it grow. Empathy is the sunlight that shows us which way to bend.
And if you take any two without the third, you‚Äôre missing a crucial component: Humble, curious, apathetic people are slothful. Humble, disaffected, empathetic people are sensitive but not very interesting. Brash, curious, empathetic people are exhausting. But when you bring them all together, you create a benevolent triad.
These three traits are the key to becoming warm, smart and memorable. They‚Äôre irrepressible and irresistible. They‚Äôre my favorite qualities in others: the most attractive, the strongest, the most admirable. And whether I‚Äôm hiring them, dating them or learning from them, these are the qualities I look for above all others.

They are attachment, or infatuation, or flirtation ‚Äî or something just being nice.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it looks across a series of emotions, lukewarm to love.
Here‚Äôs normal stuff that normal people do ‚Äî and should do ‚Äî even with strangers. It doesn‚Äôt even mean they necessarily like you as a person ‚Äî they might just be polite. Especially in the south.
None of these are signs of someone liking you. This is just normal human being stuff, guys.
Congrats, they socialize well and you probably do too.
Again, these aren‚Äôt love. Tiffany Sun just wrote a great post on this ‚Äî ‚Äúthings I wish guys didn‚Äôt take as a mixed signal.‚Äù
But don‚Äôt necessarily love you.
And not only not you, but often in a way that‚Äôs harmful to you, not genuine self-care.
i.e., things people do ‚Äúfor others‚Äù that are really for them.
i.e., a prerequisite to being able to love someone else.
Regardless of any of the above.
Way too many people worry about being ‚Äúfriend-zoned.‚Äù This is a misplaced concern. It‚Äôs a lot easier to transition a friendship into romance than to wring romantic feelings out of not even liking each other as people.
The bigger concern ‚Äî and what‚Äôs really happening for a lot of frustrated daters ‚Äî is that they barely even like you as a person.
They don‚Äôt care about your goals, your values, your fears, or your love language.
The big one is if they have a checklist of qualities they wanted in a partner and you happen to hit them. Or they have a list of stuff they‚Äôve always wanted to do with ‚Äúsomeone,‚Äù and now you‚Äôre working your way through it together. When asked what they like about you, they list different things than how you value yourself (especially if the first one is superficial, like looks.)
They adapted very little to ‚Äúaccommodate‚Äù you into their lives, and if you disappeared tomorrow, they‚Äôd just go on living exactly the same way they always have.
They make you laugh only because they get off on ‚Äúbeing funny.‚Äù They invite you on their trip because they just really want someone to travel with. They share books and music and film and restaurant suggestions because they just get off on sharing or being in the know ‚Äî or they need for you to like the same things ‚Äî not because they care about your opinion. Or they do nice gestures just because they have a deep need to feel ‚Äúappreciated‚Äù and influence over your happiness.
Somehow nothing is ever for them to own ‚Äî and they don‚Äôt want to. Their primary reaction is always to defend themselves, and they‚Äôre never to blame.
I don‚Äôt mean the occasional drifting. I mean a general, persistent feeling of ‚Äúawayness.‚Äù
One day they‚Äôre whispering sweet nothings in your ear, and then they go missing for two weeks.
Like ‚Äúbeautiful.‚Äù
They still make long-term plans without discussing it with you. They still propose weekend plans by saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs where I‚Äôll be if you wanna come.‚Äù
Their ask about your day in a way that‚Äôs half-hearted. They barely care about your struggles, and rarely share your celebrations.
They care about you and your wellbeing separate from themselves and their own.
Nobody can love without self-love. People without self-love will be seemingly ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù and ‚Äúself-less‚Äù but are actually using generosity to mask their deep-seated insecurity and need to build their self esteem around others emotional dependence on them.
They love you if they never check in on you loving them back. They love you if the energy is truly give, not give and ‚Äúnow-where‚Äôs-my-love-or-appreciation-back‚Äù take.
Without strings attached. When they‚Äôre invested in deeply understanding you. And they go out of their way to make you happy.
They rearrange their lives to fit you in.
People love themselves and their own lives, so if they start forgoing any of that to be with you, that‚Äôs a good sign.
It doesn‚Äôt have to be all their free time. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be every day. And it certainly doesn‚Äôt have to be as much as you want, if your idea of ‚Äúenough time‚Äù is higher than theirs. But they do prioritize you.
When you‚Äôre together, you‚Äôre together. They aren‚Äôt zoning out or interrupting while you‚Äôre talking, or eager for a distraction. Their mind is on the moment.
They use words. It may not be the three words you want most to hear, but there will be communication.
They‚Äôre supportive of whatever is most important to you.
Especially their future plans.
Your pain is their pain. Your happiness is their happiness. Your day is their day. Your aspirations are theirs, too.
Theirs as well as your own.

Kris Gage|18.1K|6|https://medium.com/@krisgage/oral-sex-doesnt-matter-c56c14a7afc3?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|Oral Sex Is Not The Measure Of A Partner ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Music artist DJ Khaled recently admitted in a radio interview that he doesn‚Äôt perform oral sex on his wife, and now for some reason The World feels personally victimized by DJ Khaled.
Responses include but are not limited to,
Like, for real, he could‚Äôve said that he likes to leave all the lights on, or can only orgasm while listening to Kenny G, or has a weird, uncontrollable compulsion to constantly go down on his wife, and none of this makes any difference whatsoever to us, as people who do not personally have sex with DJ Khaled.
The only person who needs to like DJ Khaled‚Äôs opinion is DJ Khaled‚Äôs partner.
Somewhere along the way, we seem to have all decided that performing oral was some holy barometer of ‚Äúbeing a worthy partner.‚Äù
User @grownmanishpod polled,
In response to these results, user @JessLuvsDonuts declared,
And in response to that, user @OsamuonameO asked a pretty obvious question:
And yeah, I side with that.
Writer Dalyce Lazaris offered a guide on ‚Äúwhat it actually means to be the ‚Äòchill girl,‚Äô‚Äù (because we‚Äôre all stressin over such a thing, apparently.) She asserts that ‚Äúchill‚Äù can include things like ‚Äúbeing flexible about which movie to watch together‚Äù (oh thank god; at least we‚Äôve got the important shit covered), but draws an ALL CAPS line in the sand on the matter of oral sex by asserting:
Say what now? Says who? You? On what basis?
What if you prefer plain ole P-in-V vanilla? THEN WHAT, DALYCE???
And ‚ÄúSteve, 25‚Äù generously offered up this simple rule of thumb on oral sex as an easy measure of the relationship:
And, wow. I mean, that‚Äôs pure poetry...
Like ‚Äúoh, fuck ‚Äî that stranger on the internet said a dude isn‚Äôt into me if he doesn‚Äôt go down, so now that‚Äôs Another Thing I Have To Have. I can‚Äôt sleep at night until I can rest assured he loves me, as measured by his willingness to perform specific sex acts.‚Äù
GUYS, COME ON.
Not only that, but we‚Äôve made ‚Äúperforms oral‚Äù a barometer of a dude‚Äôs character overall.
I think we all recall Lisbeth Salander assessment of Mikael Blomkvist in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo:
Well, who the hell asked your opinion on his sex life, Girl Who Is Not (Yet) His Sexual Partner?
I mean, she is being asked to share her thoughts on the dude in this scene, but this is the most important thing she needs to share? This is what‚Äôs offered as summary of his character?
Or person.
I‚Äôve dated great partners who perform oral.
I‚Äôve dated dudes who loved performing oral sex (some even more than I cared to receive it, which was fucking weird and, frankly, pretty off-putting) and were fucking terrible partners.
And I‚Äôve dated absolutely amazing human beings who, for whatever reason, just don‚Äôt like doing it. And that‚Äôs fine.
My currently partner doesn‚Äôt go down on me, and I literally do not care. To be fair, it was never my favorite thing to begin with. But that aside, he is the best partner I‚Äôve ever had, and my measurement of satisfaction ‚Äî in bed and in general ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt hinge on a single sexual act.
That, and I respect his boundaries as a human being.
Doing so is just cheap, disrespectful and brimming with insecurity.
Maybe he is sexist. Maybe he is selfish. Maybe he does find it gross.
But forcing him to do it when he doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äî for whatever reason ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt actually resolve the underlying issue. It only covers it up and creates weird, abstracted problems. If you think your partner is selfish or sexist, then address the mindset, not the motions.
You want equality and kindness between genders? Then respect other people‚Äôs boundaries!
Stop and consider the obvious question here:
First of all: wanting or enjoying oral sex is not the same as demanding it. I have never once been with a partner who literally demanded oral sex (or swore he could only orgasm from oral.)
If you ARE with a dude who DOES demand it, then: That‚Äôs a respect problem that should be resolved on its own, not ‚Äúbalanced out‚Äù by you demanding oral as well. (And if he can‚Äôt get over himself, then you should leave.)
Either that is a lie, or you are completely out of tune with your own body.
Because saying that you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt orgasm without oral‚Äù means that you can‚Äôt bring yourself to orgasm during masturbation. Is that true?
Like, every time you‚Äôre aroused you have to beg or plead or hope that some other living person goes down on you? Come on!
If that‚Äôs truly the case, get your shit together, sister, and figure out how to give yourself physical pleasure, damn. Not being able to cum without cunnilingus is literally the opposite of okay. You have to be able to pleasure yourself, not put the responsibility for your pleasure solely in other people‚Äôs hands (or mouths.)
See above. You are out of touch with your own body.
Yes, it‚Äôs true that many women can‚Äôt orgasm from vaginal penetration alone. But ‚ÄúP in V‚Äù and ‚Äúoral‚Äù are not the only two sex acts, and there are other options that don‚Äôt involve coercing our partners.
I‚Äôm not surprised. But that doesn‚Äôt make me wrong.
Girl, no.
People with solid self esteem don‚Äôt need to subjugate their partners or have their status reaffirmed through specific sex acts.
Only cheap, flimsy ‚Äúpower‚Äù comes from shit like this.
‚ÄúGood partner‚Äù is about bigger things.
The real offense that DJ Khaled made was when he got into super sexist jargon like it‚Äôs 1951. But again ‚Äî we are not in his relationship. So whatever.
You do you, boo boo. Stay in your lane, and watch your shit. And when it comes to monitoring for good partners, watch for the right things.
Good partners care about their partner‚Äôs sexual satisfaction, yes. That is true. But good partners also care about their partners enough to treat them with the basic consideration that they expect.

Kris Gage|17.6K|6|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-you-know-it-isnt-love-56939a087080?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|How You Know It Isn‚Äôt Love ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Here are about a dozen ways to tell:
Don‚Äôt talk to me about peaks. Don‚Äôt talk to anybody about peaks ‚Äî not your partner, not your BFF, and especially not yourself.
Everyone experiences the elation of emotional peaks with their partners, and everybody wants to call these feelings ‚Äúlove,‚Äù especially early on. But these are fools gold, and even if you think ‚Äúthis one‚Äôs different, man,‚Äù I‚Äôll tell you again:love is never in the upside.
It‚Äôs in the valleys. And that‚Äôs where you know for sure.
What‚Äôs your gut reaction when things go south? What‚Äôs your lizard brain say when shit hits the fan? I‚Äôm not saying that you should listen to it ‚Äî lizard brains are notoriously stupid, and often need to be shushed and guided by more mature and developed thinking ‚Äî but I am saying you should notice.Because love is neither fight nor flight; love doubles-down, joins forces, makes it work. If your reaction is to throw punches or throw in the towel, it‚Äôs not love.
Look, just don‚Äôt talk about love in terms of feelings ‚Äî and this definitely includes ‚Äúinfatuation‚Äù or ‚Äúpreoccupation‚Äù or ‚Äúobsession‚Äù or ‚Äúcan‚Äôt live without‚Äù (see above.)
Talk about feelings all you want ‚Äî they are incredibly wonderful parts of the human experience ‚Äî and feel All Of The Feelings for your partner, because those are some of the juiciest. Just also understand that love is a choice, an active decision, and a series of investments and efforts and actions. Theproblem with defining love as ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù is twofold: 1.) it makes for immature relationships, and 2.) leaves us susceptible to one day ‚Äúnot feeling it‚Äù and folding.
Not just for a moment (because that happens to all of us) and also not as the result of depression (look into that to make sure), but rather a pervasivefeeling of not actually connecting.
This is different than feelings ‚Äúfading,‚Äù as mentioned above. You can still care deeply for someone but feel lonely every time you‚Äôre together. If you don‚Äôt actually connect, it will never be the making of a rich relationship.
I dated one dude for a while, when we were young and dumb and didn‚Äôt know what we didn‚Äôt know, and we thought this was well enough how love was supposed to look. But I can pinpoint the exact moment I realized we should break up. We were at the mall, killing time on another empty afternoon, not even walking around or actually shopping but just standing there, leaning on a railing and looking down at a lower level. And all of a sudden I was overcome with this immense loneliness ‚Äî not in the moment, but rather the sudden and undeniable realization that I was always lonely with him. We were never truly together; never really seeing each other eye to eye; instead just rushing around to distract ourselves from it. And once we stopped and stared at nothing long enough for me to see it, I couldn‚Äôt go back to unseeing.
Honestly, I either have no idea what ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù means or I just bundle it into other things (like ‚Äúintellectual companions,‚Äù and ‚Äúfriendship,‚Äù and ‚Äúconversation,‚Äù see below.)
But I guess it‚Äôs worth including because so many people do: if you continually come back to ‚Äúthe way your partner looks on paper‚Äù to defend the relationship to yourself, it‚Äôs probably going south.
This, as I said, is probably just my ‚Äúchemistry,‚Äù but either way it is, in my mind, a very important, stand-alone thing.
I dated a dude for five years who was plenty ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and successful in his own right, but he and I fundamentally operated in very different ways. I never felt as though I had an intellectual companion, and I spent years thinking, ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs fine ‚Äî we all make sacrifices in love. There is no perfect partner.‚Äù
But there‚Äôs a difference between rooting for different sports teams and being able to have the conversations you care most about. When I shared my most cherished thoughts or abstract questions ‚Äî like ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it interesting how people choose to build their lives?‚Äù ‚Äî looking to volley answers or even (dream big!) build a full-blown discussion, he would absentmindedly quell it with, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way things are ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt mean anything.‚Äù Full stop.
When it comes to a ‚Äúlife partner,‚Äù make sure they‚Äôre actually there for the ‚Äúlife stuff.‚Äù
Like if you share big news with your partner (you got promoted, won a deal, quit that job you hated, whatever) they shouldn‚Äôt sound as though you just said you grabbed milk on the way home.
Ditto for death.
They should hug you if you‚Äôre crying, offer to go to the services (and actually go, if you want them to and they can), and refrain from making jokes too soon or demanding brownie points if they order flowers. This is easy stuff, guys. Yet it‚Äôs amazing how many people eff this up.
After my brother died unexpectedly (and then a job offer fell through only after I‚Äôd quit my previous position), I came down with the worst cold (or flu) of my life ‚Äî the kind where your nose simply won‚Äôt stop running and you can‚Äôt manage basic functions and you‚Äôre so physically fatigued you can‚Äôt even go to the grocery to get drugs for it. My boyfriend and I lived together at the time, but he was so oblivious that after a day and a half I dragged myself, zombie-like, to the drug store two blocks away and bought my own meds, and was so exhausted by the time I got back that I crashed on the couch for hours afterwards.
For anybody who‚Äôs sitting there thinking, ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you just ask him?‚Äù Iseriously encourage you to reevaluate your standards of basic human decency and awareness. Normally ‚Äúasking‚Äù is correct. But damn, son.
With the biggest catalyst being ‚Äúmoving.‚Äù
When they move across the country (or the world) and you are in no way inclined to follow (except, perhaps, ‚Äúfor the adventure.‚Äù) Or, vice versa, when you feel compelled to move across the country but only half-care if they come.
If you think you love someone because they‚Äôre ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù or ‚Äúgiving‚Äù or ‚Äúmake you feel good‚Äù or some other self-serving pleasure, then you should realize: that‚Äôs not real love.
That‚Äôs not to say you don‚Äôt (or can‚Äôt) really love them, but ‚Äúthe pleasure they give you‚Äù (or, in codependent cases, the pleasure you give them) can never be the foundation.
Just go re-read the first section, honestly.
Mature love is based on healthy non-attachment
I don‚Äôt understand how anybody could ever think it‚Äôs ‚Äúromantic‚Äù for someone to declare, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to marry you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have kids with you‚Äù shortly after meeting them.
Gross. Get out of here with that grabby shit.
One dude I dated said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make you my wife‚Äù within a couple months of knowing me, and my knee jerk reaction was: ‚Äúwow ‚Äî does he not realize I have a say in this?‚Äù
The most interesting part was: I had come home from our first date feeling the same way. But the fact that he said it so matter of factly, without me ever verbally weighing in on the matter, turned me off so much it couldn‚Äôt be salvaged. It wasn‚Äôt cute and it wasn‚Äôt romantic ‚Äî even though our feelings had once aligned, because I realized that that fact didn‚Äôt actually matter to him.
It was presumptuous and off-putting and poor form. If you find this romantic, you really need to check your idea of personal agency and emotionalboundaries.
And that realization is, on the one hand, weird ‚Äî because I make decisions like this all the time with my partners (love is, after all, choice and commitment) so I‚Äôm not sure where the line is in whether ‚Äúdeciding‚Äù is love or ownership. Maybe it has to do with actually knowing the other person (as discerned by them, not you.) Either way, all I know is that when it aligns in the right way, it feels really good. And when it doesn‚Äôt, and they claim more of you than you offered or chose, it‚Äôs heart-wrenching. And it‚Äôs only worse if youdid choose or offer, only differently or less, because they don‚Äôt care and your left standing there with your heart in your hand.
Fear and love can‚Äôt coexist. If your primary anxiety around the idea of breaking up is ‚Äúfear of being alone,‚Äù it isn‚Äôt love.
Embracing each other as individual human beings with individual human being lives, who just happen to get along enough to bump down the road alongside one another.
Then, mutual investment and support in each other‚Äôs growth, especially when things get rough or scary. But always complementary, never to complete one another. And always with care and compassion.
Or clap or follow!

John Gorman|20K|7|https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-art-of-intimacy-75bd969f6b4b?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|The Art of Intimacy ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"Some time ago, I read ‚ÄúThe Opposite of Loneliness,‚Äù by Marina Keegan, a 22 year-old writing prodigy, killed in a car accident upon graduation from Yale University. She opened her award-winning essay, which spawned an extraordinary, posthumous bestselling book of the same name, with perhaps the most succinct distillation of human suffering ever articulated in print.
There are two profound tragedies of the human condition: Loneliness is one. Impermanence is the other. Loneliness is a tragedy of space. Impermanence is a tragedy of time. Humans are felled by their bodies ‚Äî prisons that confine us to only where and when we exist. Today, we‚Äôll focus exclusively on trying to subvert loneliness. We‚Äôll explore loneliness in an attempt to find its ‚Äúopposite.‚Äù
To find the word for the opposite of loneliness, we first need to define the word itself. Loneliness is commonly articulated as the sensational byproduct of being physically, mentally or emotionally alone. For example, if you had moved to a new city, or started a new job, and maybe the others would initially look at you like you‚Äôd grown a second head, as a curious interloper from another planet thrust into a foreign culture. That‚Äôs almost loneliness, but still not quite right. Real loneliness runs deeper than that. It‚Äôs feeling alone even when you aren‚Äôt actually alone.
Have you ever had the overwhelming sense of being alone, despite a venerable cornucopia of people you could call to knock back a cocktail or 12? Do you, perhaps, go out, and then stumble home at 3 a.m. and choke half to death on your own self-loathing? Each early morning ending exactly as the day began, no closer to those you‚Äôd gallivanted around with, and your cat silently judging you, while your friends text you and say ‚ÄúMan, that shit was epic?‚Äù Yet you still feel apart? Grand loneliness can arrive cloaked in a long con of community. Succinctly: Loneliness isn‚Äôt feeling like you don‚Äôt really know anybody. It‚Äôs feeling like nobody could ever really know you. How does this manifest itself?
When you‚Äôre with people, you speak and receive faint nods of approval, off-hand laughter, and pithy responses to zingers or outside-the-box thoughts. You might share a common ground, a common goal or a common interest. You disperse to bond another day. And yet you‚Äôre still left wondering why it isn‚Äôt clicking. You may describe your relationship with the world as a car in second gear, a fire-hose bulging and bursting from the inside-out, yet a mere mist when sprayed at its target. Loneliness is an unfulfilled desire for connection with others, a loathing and resignation that‚Äôs directed inward ... the electrical voltage that sparks connection reversed and turned upon itself, paralyzing you the way a Taser would. You‚Äôve watched your authentic self wall itself off from others; the communication with the outside world is tense and terse.
Guarded sharing is risk mitigation applied to social settings. It‚Äôs a series of quick-win verbal habits that are designed to be snackable content IRL. Everyone loves a biting wit, a compliment or good news. Bring enough of it to enough people and you‚Äôll make them feel warm and fuzzy all over. These are oral slap-singles, and they‚Äôre nearly a bulletproof way to be likable. Maybe you‚Äôve done this. I‚Äôve done this often. In fact ... it is my default setting. Make people smile and laugh and then vanish into the ether.
I don‚Äôt suppose I need to tell you this makes me a hit at parties, and also, surprisingly awkward. And here‚Äôs the stinging truth: A lot of likable people are completely lonely. Picture a homeless man who smiles, says ‚ÄúI love that shirt,‚Äù and wishes you ‚Äúa blessed day‚Äù before retreating to the solace of his overpass shelter. And you can also see examples of this scrolling through your your apps.
Let‚Äôs talk about social media for a minute. We craft these burgeoning social networks, and (supposedly) gleefully over-share in the hopes that somebody, anybody, will relate to us. Perhaps you‚Äôve widened your network to one, two, three thousand people that you consider friends, or sought out an avalanche of hearts and likes on a professionally candid photo, or a status that doubles as an epic depiction of your success, or a meme articulating distrust of the government. Perhaps you‚Äôve occasionally received that validation and it momentarily made you feel less lonely inside. Perhaps the words and pictures were so good and rang so true that they could not, nor shall not, be ignored.
But when all reaction is currency, and all reaction is cursory, self-loathing and self-doubt and the other two horsemen of the self-pocalypse ride into our virtual town. What your writing and posting and taste in YouTube videos say about you is, ultimately, that you‚Äôre worth listening to. I‚Äôve experienced this on Facebook, in response to cross-posting my many Medium pieces. But is that a precursor for becoming less lonely?
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so vulnerable,‚Äù my friends would tell me. ‚ÄúIt takes so much strength, courage and guts to bleed onto the keyboard for all to see.‚Äù
Ahhh ... but the masses have been duped. For what I share with anyone isn‚Äôt indicative of any sort of emotional vulnerability. I am broadcasting ‚Äî a far less personal or emotionally risky endeavor than conversation. Broadcasting things may make you someone worth listening to, but only conversation can confirm to people that you‚Äôre someone worth truly knowing. Those two ideas, and those two classes of people, are poles apart. Becoming someone worth knowing requires reciprocity and vulnerability. It requires actual investment of emotional capital into people you wish to know. And there‚Äôs only a fixed amount allotted for distribution, in a deeper way than taking 15 seconds to ‚Äúlike‚Äù and comment, anyway.
Keeping up an actual friendship requires resources. To be someone worth knowing requires real human interaction: conversing beyond quips and quick-hits, seeing and sharing activities beyond Buzzfeed links, expressing differences, changing minds, passionately defending the points that define our character, coming through when it matters, asking for (and offering) favors. This is what makes this life worth living. When we‚Äôre lonely, what we‚Äôre really craving is more connecting, not more connections. Stumbling home after 3 a.m. exhausting every truth we have in our arsenal, armor laid at the feet of our social sparring partners. And that leads us back to the opposite of loneliness.
The opposite of loneliness is intimacy ‚Äî the act of revealing your whole self to someone else and having them reciprocate. It is something you can only do one-on-one, face-to-face, soul-to-soul. When we stop taking hacks at softball pitches and start swinging for the fences, our acts and ideas first clear, then crumble, the walls we‚Äôve built to protect ourselves. Intimacy is an act of love, an act of self-love, and an act of defiance all in one. It‚Äôs gritty, emotional, raw, unfiltered, unabashed, unpretentious and unguarded. It‚Äôs more than talking about things together. It‚Äôs being and becoming about things together.
For what are we in this world if not connectable, interlocking parts? What is this joy, suffering, talent and wisdom, if not to be shared and imparted? How much has gone wasted or unremedied due to our inability for intimacy, our own tight-lipped, tightly-wound tendencies? A soul is not a silo, a mind is not a mine. We worship, learn, aid, sing, watch, call, visit, fuck, create, talk, love, try, read and write to bring ourselves closer. To make whole what we lack in the emptiness of loneliness. Each deeper connection creates deeper character, with more room to grow, more to lose and more to become. A heart unbroken is a life unwagered. A dream undashed is a life unlived. To play safe, to play solo, is to play a fool‚Äôs game ‚Äî we may find success in rising above the rest, but we may only win by lifting up others. This requires intimacy. There are no workarounds.
Indeed, we‚Äôre only unburdened when we let our heart hang out the window to dry ‚Äî when we let it be warmed, broken, run over by a semi, lifted, toyed with, and embraced. Intimacy requires the courage to make enemies as easily as we make friends, and watch the world dare to stand with us.
This is how we beat back the gray twilight of loneliness and find ourselves in the company of those we‚Äôve challenged to truly see and accept us for who we are. It‚Äôs that feeling of two (or more!) human vessels for unchecked, unabashed, unmitigated joy reciprocating that truth, love and splendor between each other, a game of emotional and intellectual catch where neither drops the ball. It is the transcendence of body as prison, and it is the momentary defeat of our uniquely human tragedy.
We don‚Äôt have a word for that feeling yet, but if we did, I could say that‚Äôs what I want in life.

After I broke up with my boyfriend of five years in 2014, my question was around ‚Äúpersonal agency‚Äù and ‚Äúreal love‚Äù ‚Äî specifically, whether someone can really love us if they see us differently (lesser and more superficially) than we see ourselves; if there is no ‚Äútrue‚Äù reality, then which version of ‚Äúus‚Äù is real? Do we get final say in who we are and how we want to be seen (and loved?) (Side note: after 3 years and countless books, Emma Lindsay‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúFish Love‚Äù is the closest and best answer I found.)
Last year, it was around emotional abuse ‚Äî and what constitutes it ‚Äî which lead to healthy vs. toxic love. (bell hooks had the best answers here.)
And that evolved into my big question this year, which is around ‚Äúemotional boundaries.‚Äù
If you don‚Äôt agree, it‚Äôs almost certainly because you don‚Äôt (yet) realize you struggle with them. Because pretty much the only people with healthy emotional boundaries are the ones who have conscientiously and deliberately put in the emotion work to build them.
We don‚Äôt learn them from our family. (In fact, if anything, we learn the opposite from our families, most of whom are either too invasive, too dependent, or too enabling and end up encouraging our dependency on them.)
We can‚Äôt learn them from media, which is so ill with bad relationship and love models it should all be regarded as satire at best.
And we don‚Äôt learn them from others, because everyone struggles with them (see above) and some even see ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù as being ‚Äúclosed off.‚Äù These people have a lot of emotion work to do, and should get their hands on some codependence reading.
This leaves the internet and books, but most of the advice there is equally bad.
A lot of relationship books don‚Äôt even address the concept of emotional boundaries (or emotional health) ‚Äî or worse, they actively encourage people to develop unhealthy ones, which sets everyone up for suffering.
Even books on boundaries beat around the bush, instead covering ‚Äúhow important they are‚Äù (great; duh) or ‚Äúhow to stand up for yourself‚Äù and ‚Äúsay no.‚Äù But those aren‚Äôt the real issue we have, evidenced by the fact that most of us sway erratically from one end of the spectrum to the other in attempt to find balance. We first find ourselves feeling ‚Äúwalked on‚Äù and then pick a fight over stupid shit to get even.
So far most books fail to address the real issue in emotional boundaries:
We all understand the logistics of how to not eat a cookie. (You say ‚Äúno thank you,‚Äù you don‚Äôt pick it up, you don‚Äôt take a bite. Done.) That‚Äôs not the hard part.
The hard part is discerning whether or not we really want to eat the cookie.
If we don‚Äôt eat the cookie, are we avoiding it from a position of peace, or self-punishment ‚Äî or pride? If we eat the cookie, is it with pleasure or lack of self-love? Do we actually want it? Will we regret it tomorrow? Do we want it because we‚Äôre bored, or we‚Äôve had a beer, or a stressful day, or our host is extending it to us on a plate and smiling at us with those eyes that plead, ‚Äúplease ‚Äî I spent an hour baking these.‚Äù Are any of those real desires? Should any of those be regarded as real desires? Is a cookie ever an appropriate vehicle for satisfying them? Is it ever appropriate to just say ‚Äúah, fuck it‚Äù and eat the cookie without identifying our real, underlying needs?
This is the hard part with boundaries ‚Äî understanding what we truly want, beneath the surface, and what‚Äôs healthy.
And a simple, innocent cookie bears like 1/1000th the weight of a person.
And if you think I‚Äôm maybe overthinking the cookie thing, I‚Äôll remind you: the cookie was a metaphor, bud. For boundaries. And if anything, we‚Äôre under-thinking those.
Before anybody gets pissy over that, let me clarify: you are entitled to feel your feelings. But that doesn‚Äôt mean your feelings are always reasonable or anybody else‚Äôs problem. And without emotion work, they can‚Äôt define emotional boundaries.
Resources on emotional boundaries often advise the reader to simply ‚Äúunderstand what upsets, hurts, or offends‚Äù us. One article said, ‚ÄúWhen you feel anger or resentment or find yourself whining or complaining, you probably need to set a boundary. Listen to yourself, determine what you need to do or say, then communicate assertively.‚Äù
What horrible advice.
I mean, maybe, sometimes that‚Äôs valid. But maybe (most times) you need to deal with your own emotions before putting them back on others. Maybe your reason for feeling anger or resentment or jealousy or insecurity is your own problem.
If everyone followed bad advice like the above, we‚Äôd all be running around with the emotional development of children, believing every whimper that crossed our tiny brains had to be validated and honored.
Guys, no. Part of being an adult (and developing emotional boundaries) is also about being able to discern which emotions are yours alone to deal with, and not project on others.
Sometimes people struggle to stand up for their feelings. Sometimes people struggle to understand the world isn‚Äôt responsible for soothing everything they feel. Most people struggle with discerning the difference, and bounce back and forth between the two.
So: the question here is on emotion work, really. How to manage our own emotions, and being able to appropriately discern what‚Äôs ours to fix (hint: most of it), and what‚Äôs valid / for other people.
Often these resources brush people off with advice like: ‚Äúknow your boundary and then say no.‚Äù And to that shit I‚Äôm like, thanks Barbara.
The problem is we‚Äôre all so bad at it, so we don‚Äôt have the privilege of trusting our own judgment yet. So who decides? Or, better yet: how do we know when we can? What if we don‚Äôt care? Should we?
I grab fries off my partner‚Äôs plate and borrow his clothes all the time without asking. I moved across the country for him. I listen when he jumps straight to ‚Äúproblem solving‚Äù when I share something.
Are those poor boundaries?? Even if neither of us cares, should we? Hell, even if we think we‚Äôre happy, should we be?
We are subconsciously socialized to empathize with other people‚Äôs feelings, but then we‚Äôre told not to take on other people‚Äôs feelings.
We‚Äôre told to ‚Äústand up for ourselves‚Äù but also ‚Äúsurrender to love.‚Äù We‚Äôre told to ‚Äúsay no‚Äù but never ‚Äúshut down.‚Äù
We‚Äôre warned against becoming ‚Äúemotionally exhausted‚Äù after talking to others, but we‚Äôre also warned against ‚Äúwithdrawing‚Äù or ‚Äúwalling others out.‚Äù
We‚Äôre told ‚Äúthe opposite of love is not ‚Äòhate‚Äô but ‚Äòapathy‚Äô‚Äù (or maybe ‚Äúfear?‚Äù), which means loving is caring ‚Äî but what‚Äôs too much?
We‚Äôre not supposed to sacrifice our dreams for relationships, but most dreams are fantasies anyway. (Would you reeaally move to a cabin in Vermont??)
When it comes to others‚Äô emotions, it makes sense: be open to others but don‚Äôt take on their emotions as your own. Fine. It‚Äôs not actually as clear it sounds, in practice, but it‚Äôs fine enough on paper. (Eat the cookie without becoming it. Eat the cookie without needing to identify as ‚Äúcookie eater.‚Äù Fine.)
But what about our own emotions, thoughts, preferences, ideas? And how should those two come together? How do we make this all work? How do we discern and compromise?
Like: it‚Äôs always bad when people try to change their partners. Except it‚Äôs not always bad, because there are caveats like: if their habit is objectively bad, like smoking. But what if it‚Äôs subjectively bad, or just sort of bad? Who gets to decide? Do they compromise? Should both have to give 50% if the habit is only regarding one person‚Äôs body or life? How much agency do we have over one another? And how does their agency affect our own?
It all comes down to better understanding of ‚Äî and responsibility for ‚Äî our own feelings and thoughts and what we truly want most, and expecting the same of people in our life.

It can be tempting to settle for second best. To settle for what‚Äôs here, in front of us, especially when it looks a whole lot better than loneliness.
It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm telling you that you have to wait around for someone who sees you as their Dream Partner. I‚Äôm not saying to wait around for your Dream Partner. In fact, I‚Äôm saying the opposite. I‚Äôm saying that we should have good values ‚Äî and we should find partners that have good values. And good values means not holding out for some idealized image of perfection ‚Äî or settling for someone who‚Äôs measuring us the same way.
I‚Äôm saying you deserve someone who‚Äôs got their head on straight and their values in the right place and wakes up each morning, looks at you ‚Äî in your utterly imperfect human-being-ness ‚Äî and still thinks to themselves, ‚Äúaww yeah.‚Äù
Maybe you care for each other. Or maybe you just want to care for each other. Maybe you want them, but you‚Äôd want them even more if only.
Don‚Äôt live your life that way. Don‚Äôt treat other human beings that way. And don‚Äôt let other human beings regard you that way. Don‚Äôt settle for a partner who looks at you across the table and internally sighs, ‚Äúnot perfect, but they‚Äôll do.‚Äù
Look for someone who smiles, ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî I want them.‚Äù And, equally important, be that person back.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if everything is there if they always hold ‚Äúperfection‚Äù over your head. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre their favorite person to talk to, or they‚Äôre secure with you, or they spend all their free time with you, and ‚Äúevery moment together feels as natural as anything you‚Äôve ever known.‚Äù
If they‚Äôre holding out for something ‚Äúslightly better,‚Äù run. That‚Äôs not to say that ‚Äúbetter‚Äù isn‚Äôt out there ‚Äî it‚Äôs to say that we shouldn‚Äôt settle for people who enter into relationships like they‚Äôre something to maximize.
Because there will always be someone more attractive, younger, smarter, more novel (obvs), more fun, whatever.
If they want to chase phantoms, fucking let them. Don‚Äôt settle for that shit.
Imagine how heartbroken you‚Äôd feel if you met someone absolutely incredible ‚Äî only to meet their partner and realize they regarded them as ‚Äújust okay.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs how someone out there will feel meeting you and your partner if you settle for someone who does this.
You deserve better. We all do.
If they are holding out for something, leave. If they aren‚Äôt sure, leave. If they have reasons ‚Äî timing, not being ready, busy, doesn‚Äôt want to ruin it, etc. ‚Äî then bounce. If they cared, they wouldn‚Äôt want to risk it. So leave if they do.
You deserve more than someone who isn‚Äôt sure.
Writer Lacey Ramburger wrote,
You are a person, not a throw pillow. You add value as a complex and imperfect human being.
Wait for someone who sees you as special, not a chore or checkbox. Let someone else step up and do exactly what you‚Äôve been hoping for ‚Äî choose you, right now. With whatever they have to offer.

Kris Gage|14.9K|5|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-to-connect-with-others-b5f2f1a77f0b?source=tag_archive---------9---------------------|How To Connect With Others ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Probably everyone who has ever met me would agree: sometimes I struggle to connect with people.
But probably everyone who has ever met me would also agree: deep down, I actually care a lot about them.
As an often-angsty, usually-isolated introvert, I was shocked when my mom, sister, and best friend ‚Äî happy-go-lucky extroverts, every one of them ‚Äî all used the word ‚Äúcaring‚Äù to describe me when I once asked in my mid-20s.
This is a quiet little struggle; a fine line many of us dance.
And not only am I an introvert, but I am also, as one professional coach described me (in a session for which I actually paid her), one of those ‚Äújudgy little shit‚Äù ones.
I stand at arms length from others and then tell myself (and them) ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need people.‚Äù I come off as ‚Äúcold,‚Äù and when asked whether I prefer logic over feelings, I‚Äôll claim ‚Äúlogic‚Äù up and down every time.
But what this really means ‚Äî and what it means for everyone ‚Äî is that I‚Äôm actually highly people-oriented, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt even care enough to judge or get mad about them or their ‚Äúlack of logic.‚Äù It means I find people confusing, my like of them even more confusing, and the cycle inherently difficult.
And I‚Äôve learned ‚Äî only by first being honest with myself, and only secondarily by realizing I‚Äôm not alone in this tendency ‚Äî that the more someone feels compelled to be seen a certain way, the more they‚Äôre posturing and overcompensating for an uncertainty or insecurity.
And when someone all but introduces themselves: ‚Äúhi, I‚Äôm Jess ‚Äî I‚Äôm very logical.‚Äù I just want to sad smile and then lunge across the table to hug them for a little too long. Because: okay, Jess. Okay. I know.
As someone who‚Äôs been there, I know that what you probably really want is: someone who gets it. Someone to listen. Someone to rant a little bit too, sure, but also someone to bounce ideas off of. Someone to agree. Someone smart to say ‚Äúhell yeah ‚Äî you‚Äôre absolutely right!‚Äù Someone who means it. Someone who picks up what you‚Äôre putting down and says ‚Äúyes‚Äù to you and your logic.
In other words: what you really want (and what I really want) is someone ‚Äî i.e., others.
But I am also an introvert who is unsure of them.
So: I know that a major solution to like 99% of my problems (many of which are caused by ‚Äúgetting stuck in my head‚Äù) is: connecting with others (and, to a lesser extent, ‚Äútaking action,‚Äù pursuing measurable external systems and, lastly, ‚Äúnew ideas,‚Äù the last of which does least for me.)
But every time I try to connect with them, I do this in one of two ways: either a.) passively listening (‚Äúmm hm ‚Äî oh, wow!‚Äù) or b.) trying to impart my Genius Insight, the latter of which, despite my sarcastic and self-deprecating capitalization, is actually quite dear to me but is rarely understood, the combination of which means every time I try to ‚Äúconnect with others,‚Äù it‚Äôs like having my ice cream knocked straight outta my clammy kid hands.
Sometimes people don‚Äôt want to hear what I think ‚Äî about people.
I had a whole ‚Äúmoment‚Äù (it was like a year+) where I was really tripped up on the fact that everyone has a different reality and part of our ‚Äúreality‚Äù includes others and ourselves ‚Äî meaning nobody will ever see you the way you see yourself. Which is all fine in well in everyday ‚Äúreal life,‚Äù but really bothered me in romantic relationships.
Because it begged the question: then can we ever really love?
If we‚Äôre always seeing one another differently and defining each other in ways they don‚Äôt see themselves, can you really love that person?
The answer is: I don‚Äôt know. Yes. No. It ultimately doesn‚Äôt matter.
The best we can do, I think, is to a.) find someone who gets pretty close to how we see ourselves. Which means the other side of the best thing we can do is b.) try to honor and get pretty close to how others see themselves.
And although I figured this out in love, it took me a long time to realize that this is also the case in real life.
You can‚Äôt really care about a person until stop holding him at arm‚Äôs length. And you also can‚Äôt really care about a person if you keep trying to have conversations with him that you just treat as mega horns for your own Brilliant Insights.
In other words:
And:
If you don‚Äôt, then you don‚Äôt really care about them.
And that‚Äôs not to say that they might not be a self-delusional twat. In fact, they probably are‚Äîbecause all of us are.
But they‚Äôre still entitled to their reality, and part of caring for them as a person means caring for the person as they see themselves.
Man, I don‚Äôt know.
It has a lot to do with happiness, at the end of the day. If, way way way deep down, other people bring you a sense of happiness and meaning and richness (and this is true for literally almost all of us. So.), but you find yourself pulling back and feeling closed off, then you might consider this.
You have to choose, kid. You can either stare at the cake longingly through the display case, recalling all the times it made you sick or wondering how you could ever eat such a thing on your own, or you can appreciate the cake for all its imperfections and shortcomings, and come at it in a way that better honors its ‚Äúinherent cake-ness,‚Äù as a thing meant as neither our enemy nor our salvation but simply a damn dessert, nothing more. Its beauty is a smallness; its own image outside of ourselves is what makes it edible and real.
That‚Äôs maybe not a good metaphor.
But, selfishly, I want to trust that you get it. Though it‚Äôs also okay if you don‚Äôt.

Because it‚Äôs mostly shit advice.
Here‚Äôs a small sampling:
This is infatuation.
If someone‚Äôs ‚Äúalways‚Äù on your mind, you‚Äôre not focused on other Really Important Things. And that‚Äôs a problem.
Real love fits into real life, rather than usurping it. It‚Äôs calm, not overwhelming.
See above.
Ditto.
Well, I mean, damn. You fantasize long and hard enough, you can see anything in your future ‚Äî like I could imagine moving to Switzerland to be a goat farmer. That doesn‚Äôt mean I should.
The problem is that we‚Äôve made ‚Äúlove‚Äù into a game of escapism, and measure potential partners by how they fit into that fantasy. That‚Äôs not love.
So, sure, see them in your future ‚Äî but not because they ‚Äúcomplete the picture.‚Äù
See above.
Ha. Hahaha. Clearly you have never been in a (healthy) long-term relationship.
You should usually want to see bae. But love isn‚Äôt always wanting to. Sometimes you need a minute. Sometimes you need to work or do other things. Or, damn, just be.
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs not love just because sometimes you want space.
Well. That‚Äôs scary.
Y u tryin so hard? Loving isn‚Äôt ‚Äúimpressing.‚Äù
Healthy love doesn‚Äôt involve fear of loss. That‚Äôs attachment.
It also doesn‚Äôt involve fear of ‚Äúnever being with another woman.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know what that is. Low self esteem? Lack of conviction?
This is attachment again, not mature love.
This is self-love, not love. (Also: you‚Äôre an idiot.)
Well. Glad you‚Äôre getting your emotional needs met.
But this just means that they are deserving of love. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you are loving them.
Well. Thanks for the most unhelpful advice ever.
To everyone who‚Äôs ever said this: y tho? pls stahp.
Don‚Äôt perpetuate nonsense and call it ‚Äúromance‚Äù just because you don‚Äôt have suitable answers.
The difference here is probably what the rest of your day looks like.
Good: If you‚Äôre happy with your life and your partner adds to it, then congrats. You win.
Bad: If you‚Äôre unhappy and using your partner as an oasis, then you need to get your shit together.
Good: you actually care about their wants and needs, and prioritize them in a way that doesn‚Äôt tear you down
Bad: you compromise your own wants and needs, or base your value on your ability to ‚Äúkeep them happy.‚Äù
Rad for them
Congrats, there may be hope for you yet.
Great. I want happiness for most people.
You found someone with whom you‚Äôre comfortable, and whose company you enjoy. Good on you.
Role models have that effect on us, too. That doesn‚Äôt mean we love them.
You don‚Äôt feel love. You DO it. It‚Äôs an act, not a feeling. It‚Äôs a moment by moment decision and re-commitment. You know because it‚Äôs deliberate and conscious.
You invest. You exert effort.
You don‚Äôt knowingly do harm. You aren‚Äôt vengeful, petty, manipulative, or jealous. Their needs never seem irritating. You aren‚Äôt grabby with them, their time, or their affection in return. You are secure without demanding constant reassurance.
You prioritize their viewpoints. You learn their love language. You think in terms of their interests, not yours, and their needs are your own. You support them. You back them. You care and take care. You accept, and you allow.
Because everyone thinks they‚Äôre in love when it‚Äôs clear skies and calm waters, but watch them when the storm hits.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre pissed. It‚Äôs love if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúfight;‚Äù you disagree.
You love if your objective is reaching an agreement, not picking a winner.
You love if you don‚Äôt get defensive, insecure, or manipulative. If you don‚Äôt keep score. If you don‚Äôt hold grudges. If you don‚Äôt ‚Äútake back your love‚Äù as punishment.
You love if you seek to understand before being understood; listen and honor what they share ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt double down with your own issues. If you act like you‚Äôre on the same team. You listen. You compromise. You apologize. You forgive.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre hurt. Especially honoring and respecting their wants and needs even when they include ‚Äúbreaking up.‚Äù
We like to differentiate between ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù and ‚Äúloving‚Äù someone. But ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù is infatuation, and infatuation means nothing in getting real love.
So if what you want is real love, then ‚Äúhow to‚Äù is all that matters.
You ‚Äúknow‚Äù because you decide. It‚Äôs love when you do it. All the time.

Person 2: I can‚Äôt do this. I am not ready
Person 1: I love you
Person 2: Too late. I waited for too long to hear these words.
Person 1:I love you
Person 2: Oh my god me too!
Person 1: Let‚Äôs get married.
Person 2: Hold your horses. I love you but getting married is different.
These three words carry weight and meaning especially in romantic situations. Arguably, they mean different things to different people.
I: Me, my body, my mind, my soul, my heart, my ego, who I think I am. Wait who am I? Who knows?
Love: Impossible to define, but something around caring, attaching, addiction, accepting someone, can be healthy or unhealthy. Who knows?
You: Your body, what I project on you, the fantasies I have about you, how you make me feel, your personality, your being, your presence, your values. Who knows?
Confusing right?
To simplify my life, I thought of 10 alternatives to I love you, that feel more real. Feel free to share yours:
1- When I am with you, my body feels at peace
2- You meet my needs [insert needs]
3- I feel intense emotions for you, I am still figuring out what they are
4- The way you treat me, makes me feel accepted and cared for
5- Your presence makes me feel grateful about my life
6- The way you write / think / work / paint etc. inspire me to create / do / act
7- Being with you, helps me get to know myself better
8- My mind goes often into fantasy about you
9- I feel an urge to care for you, and provide you with affection both physical and emotional
10- We have a lot in common, including similar values, and it makes me wonder if we would make a good long term team

But you‚Äôre also thinking about moving on. You know that person has faults but your heart still tells you to go back, thinking about how good they are sometimes. You just want to be with that person again, for better or for worse. And guess what? More than 80% of us think of that when we break up.
Then you cry, and maybe even look up to the sky, maybe even pray and think, ‚ÄòPlease... Just let me get back with my ex. I hope my ex is just making a mistake and he/she wasn‚Äôt thinking it through. I know we are perfect for each other. I want to just call my ex up and say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù.‚Äô Then you look at your phone every half an hour, check your messenger, facebook, instagram, twitter, and heck... email inbox, to see if your ex would want to talk to you, all ready to get back together.
STOP. IT‚ÄôS ALL IN YOUR HEAD.
Guess what? Your ex wanted to break up with you because he/she thinks that something is wrong in your relationship. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs not going to work out.
Well, at least, your ex thinks that you‚Äôre not worth the effort.
Sorry to break it to you, honey, that‚Äôs the hard truth.
Remember my other post? Everyone has faults and problems. If your partner wants to breakup with you, it means that they don‚Äôt love you enough and don‚Äôt want to work things out with you.
So how can you get your ex back if they think you‚Äôre not worth it?
You need to make them feel you are worth it.
You need to increase your value.
You need to make them feel you‚Äôre too busy for them because (a) your life is wonderful (b) you have many people who would want to be with you.
As an example, imagine there‚Äôs a pair of shoes you could have got for $50. You quite like it, but you thought it was too expensive so you left. The next day, you passed by again and people started lining up in front of the store, just for those pair of shoes. The price of those shoes became $150. Would you feel like you‚Äôve missed out?
That‚Äôs exactly how we want your ex to feel.
That he/she missed out.
You need to make your ex feel that you love yourself. If you love yourself, people will love you, including your ex.
So here‚Äôs what you have to do:
While you are doing all these, don‚Äôt even try to think about your ex or what he/she would like. Do what YOU like. Be the best version of yourself.
I won‚Äôt be surprised if your ex starts contacting you again in whichever way. Most of them do.
And when he/she contacts you again, just treat them like an acquaintance, never treat them like an ex. Be nice. If you don‚Äôt feel that you‚Äôre ready to speak to him/her, then just ignore it. If they ask to meet, don‚Äôt do that because although you look all healed, I know it will still hurt when you meet again.
Don‚Äôt just start the relationship again after only a few calls/contact.
Afterall, your value is much higher now. Your ex is just another pursurer. Let them wait a while and take as much time as you want to evaluate the person again before you get back. You might even find someone who loves you more that your ex!

It‚Äôs often theorized by amateur philosophers, faux-woke bros and remedial artists that Karma is ‚Äúwhatever you put into the universe comes back to you.‚Äù That is Karma only with the lower-case k. It‚Äôs too micro. It‚Äôs too myopic. It‚Äôs wholly inaccurate. It‚Äôs the zero-sum mindset.
Life is not zero-sum. Life is an investment, not a transaction. When we think of karma (lower-case), we believe that our inputs will equal our returns. That is the selfish end of the Just World Hypothesis, and I don‚Äôt think you have to look too far into the abyss to understand the fallacy in that ‚Äî this world is not just. It is unjust. It is imbalanced. Ask anyone who‚Äôs been dealt a bad hand disproportionate to the cards they‚Äôve dealt others. And so, rather than interpret Karma as a system of debits and credits, we must realize that it is merely the inputs themselves, and the way they wash over the rest of the world.
For when we truly behave in Karmic fashion, we invest not expecting a return, but, rather, we give to foster a ripple effect: to bring about more love in the rest of the world, independently of whether we expect it to return. One good deed begets another. One good word starts a wave. One love-quake sparks a Tsunami. This is true Karma. We may be in the path of the oncoming storm, but we yet still shelter others ‚Äî winds and rain be damned. By giving, by loving, by acting, we restore balance to an ultimately tragic world where we all die and end up alone, no matter the progress we‚Äôve made.
Now let‚Äôs talk about Love. I don‚Äôt mean love in the sense of being in a relationship, I mean love in the sense of an unconditional and unrelenting compulsion to give the whole of yourself to others.
There are people on this planet who‚Äôve never had their hearts truly broken. They‚Äôve never held love in the palm of their hands, only to realize it is more liquid than solid, and never watched it helplessly drip out of their grip until it spills and seeps back into the ground from which it came. They‚Äôve merely bonded, they‚Äôve cautiously entered into a transaction: a transaction into which each gave something up, with the expectation of returns ‚Äî a partnership. Perhaps they formed it over an awkward first few dinners, or a spark-filled sojourn in the Maldives. This is lower-case love. The love that keeps you comfortable. The love that brings you fleeting joy. The love that doesn‚Äôt last so much as endure.
I know people who‚Äôve only loved once. I know people who married because they felt they were supposed to. I know people who work to pay the electric bill. I know people who make a living instead of live a life. I know people who are more data points than human. They‚Äôve never had their hearts broken: I envy them. And, more than that, I pity them.
When you break your heart, you cause the forest fire that springs the growth in the underbrush. When you break your heart, you scar the earth upon which you walk, and you allow the ivy to grow around it. When you break your heart, you begin to understand the decidedly un-transactional nature of the world we live in. You realize it doesn‚Äôt come back ‚Äî that it merely comes undone. We drift in and out, but the marks we leave are as real as the air we breathe.
The beauty around you, the impermanence and injustice of it all, closes in. It becomes clear that the twinge of tragic sadness that pockmarks existence is the one thing that makes you want to wake with the crows and listen to every chirp, feel every breeze. Everything you love will die. Everything you see will fade from memory. But holding the liquid of love in your hand, letting it flow to the level it needs, watching as it spills from your grasp and seeks its own level ‚Äî that is all that we have. It is the science and the art, the gift and the curse, the bug and the windshield.
I looked Camille square in the eye, her eyes still as earnest as the day she graduated high school with all the hope and dreams in the world. I watched her intently hang on my next breath. I thought back to the way she levitated as she sang about a man‚Äôs smile looking so much better with her lips upon it, and the way that a kiss is not a reciprocation so much as it is an attempt to reach into another‚Äôs soul and pull out what‚Äôs left of them to give back more of it, and that you‚Äôll never get it as good as you give it, you‚Äôll never give it as good as you feel it, and you‚Äôll never feel it as much as you want it.
I looked at Camille. I smiled. I gently touched her arm.
‚ÄúGet your fucking heart broken,‚Äù I told her.
‚ÄúThen, do it again.‚Äù
She left to grab another gin-and-tonic. And a part of me left with her.

GoFundMe|261|5|https://medium.com/gofundme-stories/shane-johnson-breaking-a-klan-legacy-2d05f9c8a186?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|Shane Johnson: Breaking a Klan Legacy ‚Äì GoFundMe Stories ‚Äì Medium|"Shane Johnson was born in Shelbyville, Indiana, the son of the Imperial Nighthawk‚Äîthe chief enforcer‚Äîof the Indiana White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. From the moment Shane was born, his father drilled in the doctrine, took him to cross burnings, and taught his son how to hate.
Everything was Klan, all the time. And so it became Shane‚Äôs life, too.
‚ÄúThey believe that everybody else is subhuman‚Äîthat they don‚Äôt have a soul, and only white people do. When I talk about it now, it‚Äôs so stupid,‚Äù says Shane. ‚ÄúBut at one point in time, it wasn‚Äôt to me. And it certainly wasn‚Äôt for my dad. We would have killed or died for it.‚Äù
On the first day of school, Shane refused to sit next to an African American classmate. His father was proud. When his history class studied the KKK, everyone turned and stared. Even the teacher felt uncomfortable, but Shane stayed the course. He accepted that he was just ‚Äúthe Klan kid.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you threaten a kid with eternal damnation and hell...it‚Äôs a good way to get him to listen,‚Äù says Shane. ‚ÄúI listened to everything and did everything I was supposed to do. I had no friends.‚Äù
By his early 20s, Shane and his Klan brothers were repeatedly getting in trouble with the law. And suddenly, Shane‚Äôs father died. For the first time, he no longer enforced his son‚Äôs thoughts and actions. Shane was now free to doubt, to question.
After a drunken fight in a nearby town where the Klan attacked innocent locals, Shane woke up in jail and realized that if he continued on his path, he‚Äôd likely end up in prison.
Around this time, Shane also met Tiffany, the woman who opened his eyes to the world he had missed.
‚ÄúShe brought in questioning, and that‚Äôs what started it,‚Äù says Shane. ‚ÄúI started to realize that there was a flaw in my belief system.‚Äù
Shane began reading up on other belief systems and realized that ‚Äúeverybody has problems, and it‚Äôs so much easier if you can just blame those problems on something else. But it‚Äôs not the Jewish, African American, or Hispanic peoples‚Äô fault that [we] didn‚Äôt finish high school and don‚Äôt have jobs.‚Äù
At age 22, Shane left the Ku Klux Klan for good.
But on his way out of town, Shane was jumped by his former Klansmen. They put him in the hospital for two weeks. Four years later, the KKK continues to threaten and attack Shane as a ‚Äúrace traitor.‚Äù He imagines that if his father were alive, ‚Äúhe‚Äôd be encouraging them to kill me, probably.‚Äù
Still, Shane says that leaving the Klan was ‚Äúthe best decision I ever made.‚Äù And with Tiffany and their newborn son Wyatt at home, Shane feels even more of a responsibility to speak out and strike a fresh path for his family‚Äîto create a new legacy.
But one thing holds Shane back: his tattoos. Much of his upper body is covered in hate-filled Klan ink, including multiple swastikas. The Klan gave him his first tattoos at just 12 years old. All of them were drawn by amateurs, often using melted-down chess pieces as ink.
Now, the tattoos are a lasting reminder of the past Shane wants to leave behind‚Äîand the shame from which he hopes to shield his son. Whenever he meets a new person or interviews for a job, the tattoos are the first thing they see. Shane can cover most of them with clothing, but the hateful symbols that climbed up his neck have resisted his best efforts.
That‚Äôs where Southside Tattoo came in.
Beth and Dave Cutlip of Southside Tattoo in Baltimore, MD, offer a special service to people like Shane. They cover up hateful and gang-related tattoos for free to help people leave the shameful vestiges of their pasts behind. To cover travel costs and other expenses for the people they help, the Cutlips started a GoFundMe.
When Shane heard about the Cutlips‚Äô work, he reached out to see if they could help him with his fresh start, too. After reviewing his tattoos and hearing his story, they booked him a flight to Baltimore.
Over two sessions, Dave covered the anti-Semitic and white power relics of Shane‚Äôs past. Now, his neck bears a band of roses framing his son‚Äôs name.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to see a direct effect instantly when he goes out,‚Äù says Beth. ‚ÄúShane can go to a PTA meeting. Shane can have kids come to his house and spend the night, and their parents aren‚Äôt gonna say, ‚ÄòOh, no. Your kid can‚Äôt play with my kid.‚Äô It‚Äôs so much more than just covering up that tattoo.‚Äù
Shane couldn‚Äôt be happier. Finally, his appearance reflects the man he has chosen to be‚Äîinstead of the one he was born. He calls the Cutlips his angels.
The Cutlips continue to help people like Shane who choose love instead of hate. Now, they are raising money for tattoo removal laser equipment, which will allow them not just to cover up, but to erase the hate for good.

Andy McLean|71|5|https://medium.com/@andymclean/on-suicide-a68ddd442b8f?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|On Suicide ‚Äì Andy McLean ‚Äì Medium|"Today I read a post in a Facebook group ‚Äì that I had recently had been invited into ‚Äì and it was through that community that I met a lovely man that who has lost his fianceÃÅe in the same way as my wife left this world in 2012.
By cooincidence, earlier in the day during an interview, I shared what happened prior to Rima‚Äôs death. Somehow that feels something harder to talk about than what followed.
It‚Äôs hard because it‚Äôs the part when I know I played, or didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the only memory that remains of your loved one, the most personal, painful one of all.
What happens after is different, because of what follows ‚Äì and nothing can prepare you for it. But, as a survivor, your world changes and there is nothing you can do about it.
The moment
I was sitting in our London flat when the door bell rang around 11pm. Two policeman were at the door and they came in ‚Äì I knew.
And soon they were gone again. The rest of the night is a blur as I scrambled to go to see my mother-in-law and call my family in New Zealand.
I was in survival mode ‚Äì I can‚Äôt think of another way of putting it.
The morning after
My friend Nick was soon at the flat, the phone started ringing, first my sister-in-law, then my family. And then I called work.
Soon messages started arriving as me and Nick went to Rima‚Äôs family home. That was probably the hardest moment of my life.
You simply can‚Äôt imagine what happens when you walk into a room full of relatives in a culture you barely understand. I remember my niece, Amber, saying: ‚Äúwhere is Ri masi?‚Äù.
The funeral
The time leading up to the funeral was brutal for me and mum, who arrived to be with me. I can‚Äôt put the words together to describe it.
All I can say is that it felt like the most important ‚Äòevent‚Äô that I would have to arrange. It felt like creating a play at times, with so many situations and rituals that I had no awareness of.
Were it not for two Hindu friends, I am sure I would have been mentally broken by it all. Somehow I survived.
The after math
A month or so later, I was on a yacht in the Med, on watch while my dad and brother slept. I felt helpless and could have easily jumped over board.
Before returning to London, I took a few days in Italy alone. I could not stop crying, and I wrote to a friend who had suffered cancer.
Here‚Äôs what I said:
The full effect of Ri‚Äôs death had not really hit me until I came away ‚Äì there was always a distraction, something to do, someone to call. Being away, the days are long, time seemingly endless.
Her passing is now a reality for me. Each time I look at a photo album she made for us and I break down in tears, it feels so wrong that she is not here anymore. Often it has been easier to sleep, sometimes I‚Äôve read all day.
On friends
I went on to say:
My experience over the last two months since Ri died has been that people that I might have expected to be the most empathetic have been quite the opposite. Not intentionally, rather I think they have not known what to say, or have spoken as if I‚Äôm just ‚Äògetting on‚Äô with life.
And also:
Parul, a lovely friend of ours, took Ri‚Äôs mum for dinner last week and apparently she‚Äôs really struggling, suffering from total devastation. I‚Äôm really nervous about how she will manage over the next while ‚Äì she has been out of work for a year and a half now and must be so lonely. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing her soon.
On what next
I added:
One of the things that I‚Äôve not been able to shake from my mind is the constant question ‚Äì what now? This experience has been so humbling and made me question everything. I‚Äôve fleetingly thought about life‚Äôs purpose in the the past, now it‚Äôs a daily contemplation.
And finally:
My main thought is that whatever I do from now on, it needs to be useful in some way. Working internally in a bank is so far from that, so I need a change ‚Äì that much is clear. As to what, I‚Äôm not really sure. I‚Äôve tried not to overthink it, to ‚Äútake it one day at a time‚Äù ‚Äì an often-used phrase but it seems to be working.
The rest of 2012
Getting back to work was a good thing, though I am still surprised how few people really showed empathy and concern. Jamie, who is now my best friend at Investec, really helped by spending time with me to help do my job.
At home I was alone and found solace in following the Tour de France and the Olympics. And at the end of the summer I saw my sister Charlie in France and then we went to Scotland.
The dark time
November 2012 was my darkest time. I was lost and lonely and drinking heavily.
I looked up places to jump. Humberside Bridge seemed a good option. It‚Äôs in Hull ‚Äì and that time felt like hell.
Surviving
Christmas came around and some old family friends took care of me. At at New Year, a lovely lady came to stay.
I eventually made it to June of 2013 when I realised I had to get out of London. I was falling apart and drinking whiskey from the bottle.
And to today
April 2018 will be six years since I became a widower. Even now it is hard to write that word ‚Äì to believe it actually happened.
And what I find even harder to believe is how few people know. I thought I had a ‚Äòcommunity‚Äô in 2012, but that group is nowhere to be seen or heard today, except Sharm.
A closing thought
Today I am part of an authentic ‚Äòcommunity‚Äô, known as LittlePaddle. And, there‚Äôs another that I put energy into ‚Äì Escape the City.
But, the one that I feel most part of day-to-day is Investec ‚Äì my family away from home.
I left Investec in 2014 as Jonny did this year with Escape. I am back there now, as I was in my time of need in 2012/13.
Although he‚Äôs not longer working at Escape, I know enough about Escape to feel positive that its community is and will remain here with Jonny, and his and Sophie‚Äôs friends and families.
Cascais ‚Äì where I spent time with Jonny in December 2016 at Escape House. He called Sophie every day.

John Gorman|162K|4|https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-3-keys-to-becoming-irresistible-d2f689ea4bf1?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|The 3 Keys to Becoming Irresistible ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"There‚Äôs a routine question asked in job interviews, first dates, table games and so on: What is the most important thing you look for in other people?
There‚Äôs variations on this format (i.e. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the most attractive quality you look for in a potential partner?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your greatest strength?‚Äù And so on) but, in general, the answer remains the same: The character trait you hold above all. When pressed, I‚Äôve often stumbled and resorted to something trite and probably not true: honesty, humor, confidence, charisma, etc. Those are fine answers but they‚Äôre not in my estimation the correct ones.
And so one day I sat down on my pleather couch, brewed some holy basil tea, queued up some Anderson Paak on the Spotify and really, truly tried to whittle down the essence of what makes truly admirable, special people exactly that. I analyzed people I looked up to, people I was attracted to, and people I just couldn‚Äôt dream to be without. And I found that the answer could never be just one thing, and that many of the things I think I admire are manifestations of other, deeper things I admire more. Here are the three components that, when taken together, create a spellbinding supernova of a person ‚Äî one who can command a room and control their destiny, one who can be both altruistic and intelligent. And so I give them to you and make a case for each.
This trait is the root of all growth, learning and kindness. It‚Äôs the belief that you are not yet so great that your mind cannot be opened, and it‚Äôs the presence of mind to remember that we are all interconnected equals, and that injustice against one is an injustice against all. It is, flatly, an absence of entitlement. People who exhibit humility let their work speak for itself, they remain stoic in the face of their own suffering, and they remind themselves ‚Äî and others ‚Äî that life is fragile and therefore valuable. Humility quells ignorance and cultivates grace. I want this in the people I hold dear.
Without curiosity, you cannot be enthralling or even engaging, nor ‚Äî most rudimentary of all ‚Äî successful. It is frankly impossible. Curiosity drives an insatiable quest for knowledge, culture, novelty, experience, beauty, art and connection. It is the bedrock upon which you can build a life filled with stories, memories, accomplishments and relationships. People who exhibit curiosity can become masters, or polymaths, or auteurs ‚Äî but they must first always have an open mind. They first seek to listen, to absorb, to immerse, to traverse. The world is too large and their time on it too short to ever remain fully satisfied in their pursuit of whatever new ideas pass in front of them. I want people around me to remain curious, routinely examining the world through fresh eyes, and using their eyes to find fresh corners of the world.
This trait is the miracle drug of humanity (and elephants, and dolphins). It is the simplest, sweetest attribute one can possess, and the most worthwhile one worth cultivating for social success. Empathy brings people closer, and makes others feel understood and less alone inside. And if there is one thing we‚Äôre all looking to become a little less of, it‚Äôs alone. When I see truly empathetic people, I see people who genuinely care, but also people who remind us that sometimes it‚Äôs okay to be still with someone else and not invade their space or encroach their boundaries. This unique ability to understand the world through others‚Äô eyes and cut to the heart of what others are feeling and experiencing. Empathy breeds compassion, connection and love. It is an important precursor for honesty.
You may have noticed the three are closely related. This is no mere accident. In fact, when you stack humility, curiosity and empathy, you can easily see how they amplify each other.
Humility is the soul. Curiosity is the mind. Empathy is the heart.
Humility is how you value yourself. Curiosity is how you value your others. Empathy is how you value the bonds between yourself and others.
Humility is the soil of knowledge. Curiosity is the water that helps it grow. Empathy is the sunlight that shows us which way to bend.
And if you take any two without the third, you‚Äôre missing a crucial component: Humble, curious, apathetic people are slothful. Humble, disaffected, empathetic people are sensitive but not very interesting. Brash, curious, empathetic people are exhausting. But when you bring them all together, you create a benevolent triad.
These three traits are the key to becoming warm, smart and memorable. They‚Äôre irrepressible and irresistible. They‚Äôre my favorite qualities in others: the most attractive, the strongest, the most admirable. And whether I‚Äôm hiring them, dating them or learning from them, these are the qualities I look for above all others.

Kris Gage|24K|7|https://medium.com/@krisgage/signs-they-love-you-b13e65419e8c?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|Signs They Love You ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Most of the things that are listed in these sorts of articles are not love. They are attachment, or infatuation, or flirtation ‚Äî or something just being nice.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it looks across a series of emotions, lukewarm to love.
Here‚Äôs normal stuff that normal people do ‚Äî and should do ‚Äî even with strangers. It doesn‚Äôt even mean they necessarily like you as a person ‚Äî they might just be polite. Especially in the south.
None of these are signs of someone liking you. This is just normal human being stuff, guys.
Congrats, they socialize well and you probably do too.
Again, these aren‚Äôt love. Tiffany Sun just wrote a great post on this ‚Äî ‚Äúthings I wish guys didn‚Äôt take as a mixed signal.‚Äù
But don‚Äôt necessarily love you.
And not only not you, but often in a way that‚Äôs harmful to you, not genuine self-care.
i.e., things people do ‚Äúfor others‚Äù that are really for them.
i.e., a prerequisite to being able to love someone else.
Regardless of any of the above.
Way too many people worry about being ‚Äúfriend-zoned.‚Äù This is a misplaced concern. It‚Äôs a lot easier to transition a friendship into romance than to wring romantic feelings out of not even liking each other as people.
The bigger concern ‚Äî and what‚Äôs really happening for a lot of frustrated daters ‚Äî is that they barely even like you as a person.
They don‚Äôt care about your goals, your values, your fears, or your love language.
The big one is if they have a checklist of qualities they wanted in a partner and you happen to hit them. Or they have a list of stuff they‚Äôve always wanted to do with ‚Äúsomeone,‚Äù and now you‚Äôre working your way through it together. When asked what they like about you, they list different things than how you value yourself (especially if the first one is superficial, like looks.)
They adapted very little to ‚Äúaccommodate‚Äù you into their lives, and if you disappeared tomorrow, they‚Äôd just go on living exactly the same way they always have.
They make you laugh only because they get off on ‚Äúbeing funny.‚Äù They invite you on their trip because they just really want someone to travel with. They share books and music and film and restaurant suggestions because they just get off on sharing or being in the know ‚Äî or they need for you to like the same things ‚Äî not because they care about your opinion. Or they do nice gestures just because they have a deep need to feel ‚Äúappreciated‚Äù and influence over your happiness.
Somehow nothing is ever for them to own ‚Äî and they don‚Äôt want to. Their primary reaction is always to defend themselves, and they‚Äôre never to blame.
I don‚Äôt mean the occasional drifting. I mean a general, persistent feeling of ‚Äúawayness.‚Äù
One day they‚Äôre whispering sweet nothings in your ear, and then they go missing for two weeks.
Like ‚Äúbeautiful.‚Äù
They still make long-term plans without discussing it with you. They still propose weekend plans by saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs where I‚Äôll be if you wanna come.‚Äù
Their ask about your day in a way that‚Äôs half-hearted. They barely care about your struggles, and rarely share your celebrations.
They care about you and your wellbeing separate from themselves and their own.
Nobody can love without self-love. People without self-love will be seemingly ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù and ‚Äúself-less‚Äù but are actually using generosity to mask their deep-seated insecurity and need to build their self esteem around others emotional dependence on them.
They love you if they never check in on you loving them back. They love you if the energy is truly give, not give and ‚Äúnow-where‚Äôs-my-love-or-appreciation-back‚Äù take.
Without strings attached. When they‚Äôre invested in deeply understanding you. And they go out of their way to make you happy.
They rearrange their lives to fit you in.
People love themselves and their own lives, so if they start forgoing any of that to be with you, that‚Äôs a good sign.
It doesn‚Äôt have to be all their free time. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be every day. And it certainly doesn‚Äôt have to be as much as you want, if your idea of ‚Äúenough time‚Äù is higher than theirs. But they do prioritize you.
When you‚Äôre together, you‚Äôre together. They aren‚Äôt zoning out or interrupting while you‚Äôre talking, or eager for a distraction. Their mind is on the moment.
They use words. It may not be the three words you want most to hear, but there will be communication.
They‚Äôre supportive of whatever is most important to you.
Especially their future plans.
Your pain is their pain. Your happiness is their happiness. Your day is their day. Your aspirations are theirs, too.
Theirs as well as your own.

Kris Gage|18.1K|6|https://medium.com/@krisgage/oral-sex-doesnt-matter-c56c14a7afc3?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|Oral Sex Is Not The Measure Of A Partner ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Music artist DJ Khaled recently admitted in a radio interview that he doesn‚Äôt perform oral sex on his wife, and now for some reason The World feels personally victimized by DJ Khaled.
Responses include but are not limited to,
Like, for real, he could‚Äôve said that he likes to leave all the lights on, or can only orgasm while listening to Kenny G, or has a weird, uncontrollable compulsion to constantly go down on his wife, and none of this makes any difference whatsoever to us, as people who do not personally have sex with DJ Khaled.
The only person who needs to like DJ Khaled‚Äôs opinion is DJ Khaled‚Äôs partner.
Somewhere along the way, we seem to have all decided that performing oral was some holy barometer of ‚Äúbeing a worthy partner.‚Äù
User @grownmanishpod polled,
In response to these results, user @JessLuvsDonuts declared,
And in response to that, user @OsamuonameO asked a pretty obvious question:
And yeah, I side with that.
Writer Dalyce Lazaris offered a guide on ‚Äúwhat it actually means to be the ‚Äòchill girl,‚Äô‚Äù (because we‚Äôre all stressin over such a thing, apparently.) She asserts that ‚Äúchill‚Äù can include things like ‚Äúbeing flexible about which movie to watch together‚Äù (oh thank god; at least we‚Äôve got the important shit covered), but draws an ALL CAPS line in the sand on the matter of oral sex by asserting:
Say what now? Says who? You? On what basis?
What if you prefer plain ole P-in-V vanilla? THEN WHAT, DALYCE???
And ‚ÄúSteve, 25‚Äù generously offered up this simple rule of thumb on oral sex as an easy measure of the relationship:
And, wow. I mean, that‚Äôs pure poetry...
Like ‚Äúoh, fuck ‚Äî that stranger on the internet said a dude isn‚Äôt into me if he doesn‚Äôt go down, so now that‚Äôs Another Thing I Have To Have. I can‚Äôt sleep at night until I can rest assured he loves me, as measured by his willingness to perform specific sex acts.‚Äù
GUYS, COME ON.
Not only that, but we‚Äôve made ‚Äúperforms oral‚Äù a barometer of a dude‚Äôs character overall.
I think we all recall Lisbeth Salander assessment of Mikael Blomkvist in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo:
Well, who the hell asked your opinion on his sex life, Girl Who Is Not (Yet) His Sexual Partner?
I mean, she is being asked to share her thoughts on the dude in this scene, but this is the most important thing she needs to share? This is what‚Äôs offered as summary of his character?
Or person.
I‚Äôve dated great partners who perform oral.
I‚Äôve dated dudes who loved performing oral sex (some even more than I cared to receive it, which was fucking weird and, frankly, pretty off-putting) and were fucking terrible partners.
And I‚Äôve dated absolutely amazing human beings who, for whatever reason, just don‚Äôt like doing it. And that‚Äôs fine.
My currently partner doesn‚Äôt go down on me, and I literally do not care. To be fair, it was never my favorite thing to begin with. But that aside, he is the best partner I‚Äôve ever had, and my measurement of satisfaction ‚Äî in bed and in general ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt hinge on a single sexual act.
That, and I respect his boundaries as a human being.
Doing so is just cheap, disrespectful and brimming with insecurity.
Maybe he is sexist. Maybe he is selfish. Maybe he does find it gross.
But forcing him to do it when he doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äî for whatever reason ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt actually resolve the underlying issue. It only covers it up and creates weird, abstracted problems. If you think your partner is selfish or sexist, then address the mindset, not the motions.
You want equality and kindness between genders? Then respect other people‚Äôs boundaries!
Stop and consider the obvious question here:
First of all: wanting or enjoying oral sex is not the same as demanding it. I have never once been with a partner who literally demanded oral sex (or swore he could only orgasm from oral.)
If you ARE with a dude who DOES demand it, then: That‚Äôs a respect problem that should be resolved on its own, not ‚Äúbalanced out‚Äù by you demanding oral as well. (And if he can‚Äôt get over himself, then you should leave.)
Either that is a lie, or you are completely out of tune with your own body.
Because saying that you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt orgasm without oral‚Äù means that you can‚Äôt bring yourself to orgasm during masturbation. Is that true?
Like, every time you‚Äôre aroused you have to beg or plead or hope that some other living person goes down on you? Come on!
If that‚Äôs truly the case, get your shit together, sister, and figure out how to give yourself physical pleasure, damn. Not being able to cum without cunnilingus is literally the opposite of okay. You have to be able to pleasure yourself, not put the responsibility for your pleasure solely in other people‚Äôs hands (or mouths.)
See above. You are out of touch with your own body.
Yes, it‚Äôs true that many women can‚Äôt orgasm from vaginal penetration alone. But ‚ÄúP in V‚Äù and ‚Äúoral‚Äù are not the only two sex acts, and there are other options that don‚Äôt involve coercing our partners.
I‚Äôm not surprised. But that doesn‚Äôt make me wrong.
Girl, no.
People with solid self esteem don‚Äôt need to subjugate their partners or have their status reaffirmed through specific sex acts.
Only cheap, flimsy ‚Äúpower‚Äù comes from shit like this.
‚ÄúGood partner‚Äù is about bigger things.
The real offense that DJ Khaled made was when he got into super sexist jargon like it‚Äôs 1951. But again ‚Äî we are not in his relationship. So whatever.
You do you, boo boo. Stay in your lane, and watch your shit. And when it comes to monitoring for good partners, watch for the right things.
Good partners care about their partner‚Äôs sexual satisfaction, yes. That is true. But good partners also care about their partners enough to treat them with the basic consideration that they expect.

Kris Gage|17.6K|6|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-you-know-it-isnt-love-56939a087080?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|How You Know It Isn‚Äôt Love ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Here are about a dozen ways to tell:
Don‚Äôt talk to me about peaks. Don‚Äôt talk to anybody about peaks ‚Äî not your partner, not your BFF, and especially not yourself.
Everyone experiences the elation of emotional peaks with their partners, and everybody wants to call these feelings ‚Äúlove,‚Äù especially early on. But these are fools gold, and even if you think ‚Äúthis one‚Äôs different, man,‚Äù I‚Äôll tell you again:love is never in the upside.
It‚Äôs in the valleys. And that‚Äôs where you know for sure.
What‚Äôs your gut reaction when things go south? What‚Äôs your lizard brain say when shit hits the fan? I‚Äôm not saying that you should listen to it ‚Äî lizard brains are notoriously stupid, and often need to be shushed and guided by more mature and developed thinking ‚Äî but I am saying you should notice.Because love is neither fight nor flight; love doubles-down, joins forces, makes it work. If your reaction is to throw punches or throw in the towel, it‚Äôs not love.
Look, just don‚Äôt talk about love in terms of feelings ‚Äî and this definitely includes ‚Äúinfatuation‚Äù or ‚Äúpreoccupation‚Äù or ‚Äúobsession‚Äù or ‚Äúcan‚Äôt live without‚Äù (see above.)
Talk about feelings all you want ‚Äî they are incredibly wonderful parts of the human experience ‚Äî and feel All Of The Feelings for your partner, because those are some of the juiciest. Just also understand that love is a choice, an active decision, and a series of investments and efforts and actions. Theproblem with defining love as ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù is twofold: 1.) it makes for immature relationships, and 2.) leaves us susceptible to one day ‚Äúnot feeling it‚Äù and folding.
Not just for a moment (because that happens to all of us) and also not as the result of depression (look into that to make sure), but rather a pervasivefeeling of not actually connecting.
This is different than feelings ‚Äúfading,‚Äù as mentioned above. You can still care deeply for someone but feel lonely every time you‚Äôre together. If you don‚Äôt actually connect, it will never be the making of a rich relationship.
I dated one dude for a while, when we were young and dumb and didn‚Äôt know what we didn‚Äôt know, and we thought this was well enough how love was supposed to look. But I can pinpoint the exact moment I realized we should break up. We were at the mall, killing time on another empty afternoon, not even walking around or actually shopping but just standing there, leaning on a railing and looking down at a lower level. And all of a sudden I was overcome with this immense loneliness ‚Äî not in the moment, but rather the sudden and undeniable realization that I was always lonely with him. We were never truly together; never really seeing each other eye to eye; instead just rushing around to distract ourselves from it. And once we stopped and stared at nothing long enough for me to see it, I couldn‚Äôt go back to unseeing.
Honestly, I either have no idea what ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù means or I just bundle it into other things (like ‚Äúintellectual companions,‚Äù and ‚Äúfriendship,‚Äù and ‚Äúconversation,‚Äù see below.)
But I guess it‚Äôs worth including because so many people do: if you continually come back to ‚Äúthe way your partner looks on paper‚Äù to defend the relationship to yourself, it‚Äôs probably going south.
This, as I said, is probably just my ‚Äúchemistry,‚Äù but either way it is, in my mind, a very important, stand-alone thing.
I dated a dude for five years who was plenty ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and successful in his own right, but he and I fundamentally operated in very different ways. I never felt as though I had an intellectual companion, and I spent years thinking, ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs fine ‚Äî we all make sacrifices in love. There is no perfect partner.‚Äù
But there‚Äôs a difference between rooting for different sports teams and being able to have the conversations you care most about. When I shared my most cherished thoughts or abstract questions ‚Äî like ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it interesting how people choose to build their lives?‚Äù ‚Äî looking to volley answers or even (dream big!) build a full-blown discussion, he would absentmindedly quell it with, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way things are ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt mean anything.‚Äù Full stop.
When it comes to a ‚Äúlife partner,‚Äù make sure they‚Äôre actually there for the ‚Äúlife stuff.‚Äù
Like if you share big news with your partner (you got promoted, won a deal, quit that job you hated, whatever) they shouldn‚Äôt sound as though you just said you grabbed milk on the way home.
Ditto for death.
They should hug you if you‚Äôre crying, offer to go to the services (and actually go, if you want them to and they can), and refrain from making jokes too soon or demanding brownie points if they order flowers. This is easy stuff, guys. Yet it‚Äôs amazing how many people eff this up.
After my brother died unexpectedly (and then a job offer fell through only after I‚Äôd quit my previous position), I came down with the worst cold (or flu) of my life ‚Äî the kind where your nose simply won‚Äôt stop running and you can‚Äôt manage basic functions and you‚Äôre so physically fatigued you can‚Äôt even go to the grocery to get drugs for it. My boyfriend and I lived together at the time, but he was so oblivious that after a day and a half I dragged myself, zombie-like, to the drug store two blocks away and bought my own meds, and was so exhausted by the time I got back that I crashed on the couch for hours afterwards.
For anybody who‚Äôs sitting there thinking, ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you just ask him?‚Äù Iseriously encourage you to reevaluate your standards of basic human decency and awareness. Normally ‚Äúasking‚Äù is correct. But damn, son.
With the biggest catalyst being ‚Äúmoving.‚Äù
When they move across the country (or the world) and you are in no way inclined to follow (except, perhaps, ‚Äúfor the adventure.‚Äù) Or, vice versa, when you feel compelled to move across the country but only half-care if they come.
If you think you love someone because they‚Äôre ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù or ‚Äúgiving‚Äù or ‚Äúmake you feel good‚Äù or some other self-serving pleasure, then you should realize: that‚Äôs not real love.
That‚Äôs not to say you don‚Äôt (or can‚Äôt) really love them, but ‚Äúthe pleasure they give you‚Äù (or, in codependent cases, the pleasure you give them) can never be the foundation.
Just go re-read the first section, honestly.
Mature love is based on healthy non-attachment
I don‚Äôt understand how anybody could ever think it‚Äôs ‚Äúromantic‚Äù for someone to declare, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to marry you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have kids with you‚Äù shortly after meeting them.
Gross. Get out of here with that grabby shit.
One dude I dated said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make you my wife‚Äù within a couple months of knowing me, and my knee jerk reaction was: ‚Äúwow ‚Äî does he not realize I have a say in this?‚Äù
The most interesting part was: I had come home from our first date feeling the same way. But the fact that he said it so matter of factly, without me ever verbally weighing in on the matter, turned me off so much it couldn‚Äôt be salvaged. It wasn‚Äôt cute and it wasn‚Äôt romantic ‚Äî even though our feelings had once aligned, because I realized that that fact didn‚Äôt actually matter to him.
It was presumptuous and off-putting and poor form. If you find this romantic, you really need to check your idea of personal agency and emotionalboundaries.
And that realization is, on the one hand, weird ‚Äî because I make decisions like this all the time with my partners (love is, after all, choice and commitment) so I‚Äôm not sure where the line is in whether ‚Äúdeciding‚Äù is love or ownership. Maybe it has to do with actually knowing the other person (as discerned by them, not you.) Either way, all I know is that when it aligns in the right way, it feels really good. And when it doesn‚Äôt, and they claim more of you than you offered or chose, it‚Äôs heart-wrenching. And it‚Äôs only worse if youdid choose or offer, only differently or less, because they don‚Äôt care and your left standing there with your heart in your hand.
Fear and love can‚Äôt coexist. If your primary anxiety around the idea of breaking up is ‚Äúfear of being alone,‚Äù it isn‚Äôt love.
Embracing each other as individual human beings with individual human being lives, who just happen to get along enough to bump down the road alongside one another.
Then, mutual investment and support in each other‚Äôs growth, especially when things get rough or scary. But always complementary, never to complete one another. And always with care and compassion.

John Gorman|20K|7|https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-art-of-intimacy-75bd969f6b4b?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|The Art of Intimacy ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"Some time ago, I read ‚ÄúThe Opposite of Loneliness,‚Äù by Marina Keegan, a 22 year-old writing prodigy, killed in a car accident upon graduation from Yale University. She opened her award-winning essay, which spawned an extraordinary, posthumous bestselling book of the same name, with perhaps the most succinct distillation of human suffering ever articulated in print.
There are two profound tragedies of the human condition: Loneliness is one. Impermanence is the other. Loneliness is a tragedy of space. Impermanence is a tragedy of time. Humans are felled by their bodies ‚Äî prisons that confine us to only where and when we exist. Today, we‚Äôll focus exclusively on trying to subvert loneliness. We‚Äôll explore loneliness in an attempt to find its ‚Äúopposite.‚Äù
To find the word for the opposite of loneliness, we first need to define the word itself. Loneliness is commonly articulated as the sensational byproduct of being physically, mentally or emotionally alone. For example, if you had moved to a new city, or started a new job, and maybe the others would initially look at you like you‚Äôd grown a second head, as a curious interloper from another planet thrust into a foreign culture. That‚Äôs almost loneliness, but still not quite right. Real loneliness runs deeper than that. It‚Äôs feeling alone even when you aren‚Äôt actually alone.
Have you ever had the overwhelming sense of being alone, despite a venerable cornucopia of people you could call to knock back a cocktail or 12? Do you, perhaps, go out, and then stumble home at 3 a.m. and choke half to death on your own self-loathing? Each early morning ending exactly as the day began, no closer to those you‚Äôd gallivanted around with, and your cat silently judging you, while your friends text you and say ‚ÄúMan, that shit was epic?‚Äù Yet you still feel apart? Grand loneliness can arrive cloaked in a long con of community. Succinctly: Loneliness isn‚Äôt feeling like you don‚Äôt really know anybody. It‚Äôs feeling like nobody could ever really know you. How does this manifest itself?
When you‚Äôre with people, you speak and receive faint nods of approval, off-hand laughter, and pithy responses to zingers or outside-the-box thoughts. You might share a common ground, a common goal or a common interest. You disperse to bond another day. And yet you‚Äôre still left wondering why it isn‚Äôt clicking. You may describe your relationship with the world as a car in second gear, a fire-hose bulging and bursting from the inside-out, yet a mere mist when sprayed at its target. Loneliness is an unfulfilled desire for connection with others, a loathing and resignation that‚Äôs directed inward ... the electrical voltage that sparks connection reversed and turned upon itself, paralyzing you the way a Taser would. You‚Äôve watched your authentic self wall itself off from others; the communication with the outside world is tense and terse.
Guarded sharing is risk mitigation applied to social settings. It‚Äôs a series of quick-win verbal habits that are designed to be snackable content IRL. Everyone loves a biting wit, a compliment or good news. Bring enough of it to enough people and you‚Äôll make them feel warm and fuzzy all over. These are oral slap-singles, and they‚Äôre nearly a bulletproof way to be likable. Maybe you‚Äôve done this. I‚Äôve done this often. In fact ... it is my default setting. Make people smile and laugh and then vanish into the ether.
I don‚Äôt suppose I need to tell you this makes me a hit at parties, and also, surprisingly awkward. And here‚Äôs the stinging truth: A lot of likable people are completely lonely. Picture a homeless man who smiles, says ‚ÄúI love that shirt,‚Äù and wishes you ‚Äúa blessed day‚Äù before retreating to the solace of his overpass shelter. And you can also see examples of this scrolling through your your apps.
Let‚Äôs talk about social media for a minute. We craft these burgeoning social networks, and (supposedly) gleefully over-share in the hopes that somebody, anybody, will relate to us. Perhaps you‚Äôve widened your network to one, two, three thousand people that you consider friends, or sought out an avalanche of hearts and likes on a professionally candid photo, or a status that doubles as an epic depiction of your success, or a meme articulating distrust of the government. Perhaps you‚Äôve occasionally received that validation and it momentarily made you feel less lonely inside. Perhaps the words and pictures were so good and rang so true that they could not, nor shall not, be ignored.
But when all reaction is currency, and all reaction is cursory, self-loathing and self-doubt and the other two horsemen of the self-pocalypse ride into our virtual town. What your writing and posting and taste in YouTube videos say about you is, ultimately, that you‚Äôre worth listening to. I‚Äôve experienced this on Facebook, in response to cross-posting my many Medium pieces. But is that a precursor for becoming less lonely?
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so vulnerable,‚Äù my friends would tell me. ‚ÄúIt takes so much strength, courage and guts to bleed onto the keyboard for all to see.‚Äù
Ahhh ... but the masses have been duped. For what I share with anyone isn‚Äôt indicative of any sort of emotional vulnerability. I am broadcasting ‚Äî a far less personal or emotionally risky endeavor than conversation. Broadcasting things may make you someone worth listening to, but only conversation can confirm to people that you‚Äôre someone worth truly knowing. Those two ideas, and those two classes of people, are poles apart. Becoming someone worth knowing requires reciprocity and vulnerability. It requires actual investment of emotional capital into people you wish to know. And there‚Äôs only a fixed amount allotted for distribution, in a deeper way than taking 15 seconds to ‚Äúlike‚Äù and comment, anyway.
Keeping up an actual friendship requires resources. To be someone worth knowing requires real human interaction: conversing beyond quips and quick-hits, seeing and sharing activities beyond Buzzfeed links, expressing differences, changing minds, passionately defending the points that define our character, coming through when it matters, asking for (and offering) favors. This is what makes this life worth living. When we‚Äôre lonely, what we‚Äôre really craving is more connecting, not more connections. Stumbling home after 3 a.m. exhausting every truth we have in our arsenal, armor laid at the feet of our social sparring partners. And that leads us back to the opposite of loneliness.
The opposite of loneliness is intimacy ‚Äî the act of revealing your whole self to someone else and having them reciprocate. It is something you can only do one-on-one, face-to-face, soul-to-soul. When we stop taking hacks at softball pitches and start swinging for the fences, our acts and ideas first clear, then crumble, the walls we‚Äôve built to protect ourselves. Intimacy is an act of love, an act of self-love, and an act of defiance all in one. It‚Äôs gritty, emotional, raw, unfiltered, unabashed, unpretentious and unguarded. It‚Äôs more than talking about things together. It‚Äôs being and becoming about things together.
For what are we in this world if not connectable, interlocking parts? What is this joy, suffering, talent and wisdom, if not to be shared and imparted? How much has gone wasted or unremedied due to our inability for intimacy, our own tight-lipped, tightly-wound tendencies? A soul is not a silo, a mind is not a mine. We worship, learn, aid, sing, watch, call, visit, fuck, create, talk, love, try, read and write to bring ourselves closer. To make whole what we lack in the emptiness of loneliness. Each deeper connection creates deeper character, with more room to grow, more to lose and more to become. A heart unbroken is a life unwagered. A dream undashed is a life unlived. To play safe, to play solo, is to play a fool‚Äôs game ‚Äî we may find success in rising above the rest, but we may only win by lifting up others. This requires intimacy. There are no workarounds.
Indeed, we‚Äôre only unburdened when we let our heart hang out the window to dry ‚Äî when we let it be warmed, broken, run over by a semi, lifted, toyed with, and embraced. Intimacy requires the courage to make enemies as easily as we make friends, and watch the world dare to stand with us.
This is how we beat back the gray twilight of loneliness and find ourselves in the company of those we‚Äôve challenged to truly see and accept us for who we are. It‚Äôs that feeling of two (or more!) human vessels for unchecked, unabashed, unmitigated joy reciprocating that truth, love and splendor between each other, a game of emotional and intellectual catch where neither drops the ball. It is the transcendence of body as prison, and it is the momentary defeat of our uniquely human tragedy.
We don‚Äôt have a word for that feeling yet, but if we did, I could say that‚Äôs what I want in life.

Kris Gage|10.1K|7|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-much-to-give-and-take-in-relationships-ccbdf31e2f4e?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|How Much To Give And Take In Relationships ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"I always have a big question in my head, and it‚Äôs always about love ‚Äî and life.
After I broke up with my boyfriend of five years in 2014, my question was around ‚Äúpersonal agency‚Äù and ‚Äúreal love‚Äù ‚Äî specifically, whether someone can really love us if they see us differently (lesser and more superficially) than we see ourselves; if there is no ‚Äútrue‚Äù reality, then which version of ‚Äúus‚Äù is real? Do we get final say in who we are and how we want to be seen (and loved?) (Side note: after 3 years and countless books, Emma Lindsay‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúFish Love‚Äù is the closest and best answer I found.)
Last year, it was around emotional abuse ‚Äî and what constitutes it ‚Äî which lead to healthy vs. toxic love. (bell hooks had the best answers here.)
And that evolved into my big question this year, which is around ‚Äúemotional boundaries.‚Äù
If you don‚Äôt agree, it‚Äôs almost certainly because you don‚Äôt (yet) realize you struggle with them. Because pretty much the only people with healthy emotional boundaries are the ones who have conscientiously and deliberately put in the emotion work to build them.
We don‚Äôt learn them from our family. (In fact, if anything, we learn the opposite from our families, most of whom are either too invasive, too dependent, or too enabling and end up encouraging our dependency on them.)
We can‚Äôt learn them from media, which is so ill with bad relationship and love models it should all be regarded as satire at best.
And we don‚Äôt learn them from others, because everyone struggles with them (see above) and some even see ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù as being ‚Äúclosed off.‚Äù These people have a lot of emotion work to do, and should get their hands on some codependence reading.
This leaves the internet and books, but most of the advice there is equally bad.
A lot of relationship books don‚Äôt even address the concept of emotional boundaries (or emotional health) ‚Äî or worse, they actively encourage people to develop unhealthy ones, which sets everyone up for suffering.
Even books on boundaries beat around the bush, instead covering ‚Äúhow important they are‚Äù (great; duh) or ‚Äúhow to stand up for yourself‚Äù and ‚Äúsay no.‚Äù But those aren‚Äôt the real issue we have, evidenced by the fact that most of us sway erratically from one end of the spectrum to the other in attempt to find balance. We first find ourselves feeling ‚Äúwalked on‚Äù and then pick a fight over stupid shit to get even.
So far most books fail to address the real issue in emotional boundaries:
We all understand the logistics of how to not eat a cookie. (You say ‚Äúno thank you,‚Äù you don‚Äôt pick it up, you don‚Äôt take a bite. Done.) That‚Äôs not the hard part.
The hard part is discerning whether or not we really want to eat the cookie.
If we don‚Äôt eat the cookie, are we avoiding it from a position of peace, or self-punishment ‚Äî or pride? If we eat the cookie, is it with pleasure or lack of self-love? Do we actually want it? Will we regret it tomorrow? Do we want it because we‚Äôre bored, or we‚Äôve had a beer, or a stressful day, or our host is extending it to us on a plate and smiling at us with those eyes that plead, ‚Äúplease ‚Äî I spent an hour baking these.‚Äù Are any of those real desires? Should any of those be regarded as real desires? Is a cookie ever an appropriate vehicle for satisfying them? Is it ever appropriate to just say ‚Äúah, fuck it‚Äù and eat the cookie without identifying our real, underlying needs?
This is the hard part with boundaries ‚Äî understanding what we truly want, beneath the surface, and what‚Äôs healthy.
And a simple, innocent cookie bears like 1/1000th the weight of a person.
And if you think I‚Äôm maybe overthinking the cookie thing, I‚Äôll remind you: the cookie was a metaphor, bud. For boundaries. And if anything, we‚Äôre under-thinking those.
Before anybody gets pissy over that, let me clarify: you are entitled to feel your feelings. But that doesn‚Äôt mean your feelings are always reasonable or anybody else‚Äôs problem. And without emotion work, they can‚Äôt define emotional boundaries.
Resources on emotional boundaries often advise the reader to simply ‚Äúunderstand what upsets, hurts, or offends‚Äù us. One article said, ‚ÄúWhen you feel anger or resentment or find yourself whining or complaining, you probably need to set a boundary. Listen to yourself, determine what you need to do or say, then communicate assertively.‚Äù
What horrible advice.
I mean, maybe, sometimes that‚Äôs valid. But maybe (most times) you need to deal with your own emotions before putting them back on others. Maybe your reason for feeling anger or resentment or jealousy or insecurity is your own problem.
If everyone followed bad advice like the above, we‚Äôd all be running around with the emotional development of children, believing every whimper that crossed our tiny brains had to be validated and honored.
Guys, no. Part of being an adult (and developing emotional boundaries) is also about being able to discern which emotions are yours alone to deal with, and not project on others.
Sometimes people struggle to stand up for their feelings. Sometimes people struggle to understand the world isn‚Äôt responsible for soothing everything they feel. Most people struggle with discerning the difference, and bounce back and forth between the two.
So: the question here is on emotion work, really. How to manage our own emotions, and being able to appropriately discern what‚Äôs ours to fix (hint: most of it), and what‚Äôs valid / for other people.
Often these resources brush people off with advice like: ‚Äúknow your boundary and then say no.‚Äù And to that shit I‚Äôm like, thanks Barbara.
The problem is we‚Äôre all so bad at it, so we don‚Äôt have the privilege of trusting our own judgment yet. So who decides? Or, better yet: how do we know when we can? What if we don‚Äôt care? Should we?
I grab fries off my partner‚Äôs plate and borrow his clothes all the time without asking. I moved across the country for him. I listen when he jumps straight to ‚Äúproblem solving‚Äù when I share something.
Are those poor boundaries?? Even if neither of us cares, should we? Hell, even if we think we‚Äôre happy, should we be?
We are subconsciously socialized to empathize with other people‚Äôs feelings, but then we‚Äôre told not to take on other people‚Äôs feelings.
We‚Äôre told to ‚Äústand up for ourselves‚Äù but also ‚Äúsurrender to love.‚Äù We‚Äôre told to ‚Äúsay no‚Äù but never ‚Äúshut down.‚Äù
We‚Äôre warned against becoming ‚Äúemotionally exhausted‚Äù after talking to others, but we‚Äôre also warned against ‚Äúwithdrawing‚Äù or ‚Äúwalling others out.‚Äù
We‚Äôre told ‚Äúthe opposite of love is not ‚Äòhate‚Äô but ‚Äòapathy‚Äô‚Äù (or maybe ‚Äúfear?‚Äù), which means loving is caring ‚Äî but what‚Äôs too much?
We‚Äôre not supposed to sacrifice our dreams for relationships, but most dreams are fantasies anyway. (Would you reeaally move to a cabin in Vermont??)
When it comes to others‚Äô emotions, it makes sense: be open to others but don‚Äôt take on their emotions as your own. Fine. It‚Äôs not actually as clear it sounds, in practice, but it‚Äôs fine enough on paper. (Eat the cookie without becoming it. Eat the cookie without needing to identify as ‚Äúcookie eater.‚Äù Fine.)
But what about our own emotions, thoughts, preferences, ideas? And how should those two come together? How do we make this all work? How do we discern and compromise?
Like: it‚Äôs always bad when people try to change their partners. Except it‚Äôs not always bad, because there are caveats like: if their habit is objectively bad, like smoking. But what if it‚Äôs subjectively bad, or just sort of bad? Who gets to decide? Do they compromise? Should both have to give 50% if the habit is only regarding one person‚Äôs body or life? How much agency do we have over one another? And how does their agency affect our own?
It all comes down to better understanding of ‚Äî and responsibility for ‚Äî our own feelings and thoughts and what we truly want most, and expecting the same of people in our life.

It can be tempting to settle for second best. To settle for what‚Äôs here, in front of us, especially when it looks a whole lot better than loneliness.
It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm telling you that you have to wait around for someone who sees you as their Dream Partner. I‚Äôm not saying to wait around for your Dream Partner. In fact, I‚Äôm saying the opposite. I‚Äôm saying that we should have good values ‚Äî and we should find partners that have good values. And good values means not holding out for some idealized image of perfection ‚Äî or settling for someone who‚Äôs measuring us the same way.
I‚Äôm saying you deserve someone who‚Äôs got their head on straight and their values in the right place and wakes up each morning, looks at you ‚Äî in your utterly imperfect human-being-ness ‚Äî and still thinks to themselves, ‚Äúaww yeah.‚Äù
Maybe you care for each other. Or maybe you just want to care for each other. Maybe you want them, but you‚Äôd want them even more if only.
Don‚Äôt live your life that way. Don‚Äôt treat other human beings that way. And don‚Äôt let other human beings regard you that way. Don‚Äôt settle for a partner who looks at you across the table and internally sighs, ‚Äúnot perfect, but they‚Äôll do.‚Äù
Look for someone who smiles, ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî I want them.‚Äù And, equally important, be that person back.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if everything is there if they always hold ‚Äúperfection‚Äù over your head. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre their favorite person to talk to, or they‚Äôre secure with you, or they spend all their free time with you, and ‚Äúevery moment together feels as natural as anything you‚Äôve ever known.‚Äù
If they‚Äôre holding out for something ‚Äúslightly better,‚Äù run. That‚Äôs not to say that ‚Äúbetter‚Äù isn‚Äôt out there ‚Äî it‚Äôs to say that we shouldn‚Äôt settle for people who enter into relationships like they‚Äôre something to maximize.
Because there will always be someone more attractive, younger, smarter, more novel (obvs), more fun, whatever.
If they want to chase phantoms, fucking let them. Don‚Äôt settle for that shit.
Imagine how heartbroken you‚Äôd feel if you met someone absolutely incredible ‚Äî only to meet their partner and realize they regarded them as ‚Äújust okay.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs how someone out there will feel meeting you and your partner if you settle for someone who does this.
You deserve better. We all do.
If they are holding out for something, leave. If they aren‚Äôt sure, leave. If they have reasons ‚Äî timing, not being ready, busy, doesn‚Äôt want to ruin it, etc. ‚Äî then bounce. If they cared, they wouldn‚Äôt want to risk it. So leave if they do.
You deserve more than someone who isn‚Äôt sure.

Kris Gage|14.9K|5|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-to-connect-with-others-b5f2f1a77f0b?source=tag_archive---------7---------------------|How To Connect With Others ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Probably everyone who has ever met me would agree: sometimes I struggle to connect with people.
But probably everyone who has ever met me would also agree: deep down, I actually care a lot about them.
As an often-angsty, usually-isolated introvert, I was shocked when my mom, sister, and best friend ‚Äî happy-go-lucky extroverts, every one of them ‚Äî all used the word ‚Äúcaring‚Äù to describe me when I once asked in my mid-20s.
This is a quiet little struggle; a fine line many of us dance.
And not only am I an introvert, but I am also, as one professional coach described me (in a session for which I actually paid her), one of those ‚Äújudgy little shit‚Äù ones.
I stand at arms length from others and then tell myself (and them) ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need people.‚Äù I come off as ‚Äúcold,‚Äù and when asked whether I prefer logic over feelings, I‚Äôll claim ‚Äúlogic‚Äù up and down every time.
But what this really means ‚Äî and what it means for everyone ‚Äî is that I‚Äôm actually highly people-oriented, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt even care enough to judge or get mad about them or their ‚Äúlack of logic.‚Äù It means I find people confusing, my like of them even more confusing, and the cycle inherently difficult.
And I‚Äôve learned ‚Äî only by first being honest with myself, and only secondarily by realizing I‚Äôm not alone in this tendency ‚Äî that the more someone feels compelled to be seen a certain way, the more they‚Äôre posturing and overcompensating for an uncertainty or insecurity.
And when someone all but introduces themselves: ‚Äúhi, I‚Äôm Jess ‚Äî I‚Äôm very logical.‚Äù I just want to sad smile and then lunge across the table to hug them for a little too long. Because: okay, Jess. Okay. I know.
As someone who‚Äôs been there, I know that what you probably really want is: someone who gets it. Someone to listen. Someone to rant a little bit too, sure, but also someone to bounce ideas off of. Someone to agree. Someone smart to say ‚Äúhell yeah ‚Äî you‚Äôre absolutely right!‚Äù Someone who means it. Someone who picks up what you‚Äôre putting down and says ‚Äúyes‚Äù to you and your logic.
In other words: what you really want (and what I really want) is someone ‚Äî i.e., others.
But I am also an introvert who is unsure of them.
So: I know that a major solution to like 99% of my problems (many of which are caused by ‚Äúgetting stuck in my head‚Äù) is: connecting with others (and, to a lesser extent, ‚Äútaking action,‚Äù pursuing measurable external systems and, lastly, ‚Äúnew ideas,‚Äù the last of which does least for me.)
But every time I try to connect with them, I do this in one of two ways: either a.) passively listening (‚Äúmm hm ‚Äî oh, wow!‚Äù) or b.) trying to impart my Genius Insight, the latter of which, despite my sarcastic and self-deprecating capitalization, is actually quite dear to me but is rarely understood, the combination of which means every time I try to ‚Äúconnect with others,‚Äù it‚Äôs like having my ice cream knocked straight outta my clammy kid hands.
Sometimes people don‚Äôt want to hear what I think ‚Äî about people.
I had a whole ‚Äúmoment‚Äù (it was like a year+) where I was really tripped up on the fact that everyone has a different reality and part of our ‚Äúreality‚Äù includes others and ourselves ‚Äî meaning nobody will ever see you the way you see yourself. Which is all fine in well in everyday ‚Äúreal life,‚Äù but really bothered me in romantic relationships.
Because it begged the question: then can we ever really love?
If we‚Äôre always seeing one another differently and defining each other in ways they don‚Äôt see themselves, can you really love that person?
The answer is: I don‚Äôt know. Yes. No. It ultimately doesn‚Äôt matter.
The best we can do, I think, is to a.) find someone who gets pretty close to how we see ourselves. Which means the other side of the best thing we can do is b.) try to honor and get pretty close to how others see themselves.
And although I figured this out in love, it took me a long time to realize that this is also the case in real life.
You can‚Äôt really care about a person until stop holding him at arm‚Äôs length. And you also can‚Äôt really care about a person if you keep trying to have conversations with him that you just treat as mega horns for your own Brilliant Insights.
In other words:
And:
If you don‚Äôt, then you don‚Äôt really care about them.
And that‚Äôs not to say that they might not be a self-delusional twat. In fact, they probably are‚Äîbecause all of us are.
But they‚Äôre still entitled to their reality, and part of caring for them as a person means caring for the person as they see themselves.
Man, I don‚Äôt know.
It has a lot to do with happiness, at the end of the day. If, way way way deep down, other people bring you a sense of happiness and meaning and richness (and this is true for literally almost all of us. So.), but you find yourself pulling back and feeling closed off, then you might consider this.
You have to choose, kid. You can either stare at the cake longingly through the display case, recalling all the times it made you sick or wondering how you could ever eat such a thing on your own, or you can appreciate the cake for all its imperfections and shortcomings, and come at it in a way that better honors its ‚Äúinherent cake-ness,‚Äù as a thing meant as neither our enemy nor our salvation but simply a damn dessert, nothing more. Its beauty is a smallness; its own image outside of ourselves is what makes it edible and real.
That‚Äôs maybe not a good metaphor.
But, selfishly, I want to trust that you get it. Though it‚Äôs also okay if you don‚Äôt.

Bonnie Barton|11.9K|7|https://psiloveyou.xyz/i-called-out-a-guy-who-wanted-to-use-me-cd9463b6b041?source=tag_archive---------8---------------------|I Called Out a Guy Who Wanted to Use Me ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"I read two stories over the weekend that collided in my brain.
(Shani Silver‚Äôs ‚Äú5 Bullsh*t Dating Practices That Have Jumped the Shark‚Äù and Jessica Wildfire‚Äôs ‚ÄúGuys, stop sending pictures of your junk.‚Äù)
They intersect with my most recent crash-and-burn interaction with another online dating dude.
I met him online a few weeks ago. He quickly provided the link to his professional website. He sent a short video of himself and his dog.
He communicated easily and checked in with me. I appreciated his effort to share small snippets of his life.
I liked his transparency. This felt more ‚Äúreal‚Äù than many of the interactions I have with men who I meet online.
By showing who he was and texting to ask about me, it felt like he was attempting to forge an authentic connection.
(I‚Äôve done this long enough to know that ANYTHING can happen. But it was an encouraging start.)
Eventually we got a little flirty. I took this opportunity to throw in some comments that would indicate I was not into any sort of dick pic, S&M/fetish relationship, or a casual sexual interaction.
We specifically discussed that men tend to be more visual while women are less so. He confirmed that he was very visual. I explicitly told him that I need to know someone better before I would ever want a suggestive photo of him.
I even acknowledged that no one had ever sent me a dick pic and I had no intention of soliciting one!
Fast forward an hour or two and he began asking for a photo of me. I responded that I hate selfies (true) and I wasn‚Äôt sure what I had on my phone.
Dude: It doesn‚Äôt have to be of your face.
Me (dawning realization of what he was really asking for)
A few moments later I realized that I had no desire to give this stranger a photo of myself.
Me: ‚ÄúActually, you can just look at the photos on my profile.‚Äù (I had about 10 posted on my profile.)
Dude: ‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù
He then asked if I wanted a photo of him. I told him that I did not. It was too soon. (We had not talked on the phone or met in person. We had only been texting for a day or two.)
Within a few minutes, he sent me a picture of himself in bed (presumably naked) cropped to just shy of his genitals.
I. was. pissed!
I had SUCH a strong reaction. Which caught me off guard.
I immediately deleted the photo and reamed him out.
I told him that I had deleted the photo. That I didn‚Äôt appreciate him sending me a photo of him in that position when I had already told him unequivocally that I had no interest in a risque photo of him.
I told him that I did not feel like he was listening to me. And that I didn‚Äôt like that AT ALL!
To his credit, he apologized immediately.
Bonnie from 4 years ago would have frozen and panicked. I probably would have just immediately blocked him.
I might have blamed myself somehow.
Bonnie of today doesn‚Äôt take that crap!
This guy‚Äôs behavior was boorish and misguided, but perhaps no one had ever called him out for it. (And, of course, technically it was not a dick pic.)
Or even more likely, I suspect a certain percentage of women have reciprocated with a similar photo. Which is fine. But it muddies the waters for guys. Well, for all of us.
It was a little scary to be so direct with a complete stranger. It occurred to me that he would most likely respond by getting angry or defensive with me. Or ghosting me entirely.
He was cute, smart, had a good job, I enjoyed texting him, and he seemed interesting. But I was going to call him out anyway and risk blowing this thing before I had even met him.
Nonetheless, I stuck to my guns.
And it felt good.
I accepted his apology and we did go out a couple of times.
It ended abruptly when he made it clear he wanted to sow oats with me and other women. I was fine with dating him, but told him that I would not be having a sexual relationship while he was sleeping with other women.
He said he wasn‚Äôt willing to wait.
I simply stated: ‚ÄúFair enough. Thank you for being honest. We are at an impasse.‚Äù
I assumed I would not hear from again.
He surprised me a few hours later by texting me about my night. Then he asked if he could stay over sometime. I was flabbergasted. I ended up calling him and reassuring him that I was not playing some sort of game.
There was nothing he could say or do that would change my mind regarding this matter.
As for him, I had told him what type of relationship I was comfortable with and he had declined. I had no intention of engaging in an argument with a grown adult. He had clearly communicated that he was unwilling to wait for a sexual relationship with me. I took him at his word.
I did, however, take the opportunity on the phone to point out what he was offering me: To ‚Äúdate‚Äù me. Under his scenario that meant that he could sleep with someone the prior night, then sleep with me, then sleep with someone else the next night.
I stated again that that offer was unappealing to me.
He simply muttered that ‚Äúit wouldn‚Äôt really be like that.‚Äù I countered: ‚ÄúOh,no. That is EXACTLY what you are asking of me.‚Äù
I was not going to let him try to spin this.
He said he was a friendly guy. That he liked our chemistry and our banter. That I was mature and interesting. That he wanted to see me again.
Me (very calmly and directly, not bitchy): ‚ÄúYeah, I think I‚Äôm going to pass. Usually I can stay in touch or be friends, but I don‚Äôt think I need to with you.‚Äù
We knew there was nowhere for this conversation to go, so we politely parted ways.
Even after all these years, it‚Äôs not easy for me to be treated like this. It hurts me. I can tolerate it better than I used to, but it still feels unnatural and callous.
Upon reflection I realize why I don‚Äôt need to know him even as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù: he straight up treated me like an object, like a number, like a notch. After we got off the phone, I shed a few tears.
He wanted the banter, my maturity, my interesting life and stories, my face, my body, and our chemistry. He wanted to take.
And he didn‚Äôt want to give me anything other than the bare minimum. His selfishness was repugnant.
My interaction with #notquiteadickpic guy allows me to see my growth over the past few years. I‚Äôm proud of myself for communicating so clearly when I was made uncomfortable by the unsolicited photo AND the unappealing offer to date me on HIS terms.
I don‚Äôt like a lot of conflict, but I see value in my remaining true to myself. In standing up for myself. In honoring boundaries.
I‚Äôve started to realize, too, that maybe my boldness in calling some of this ridiculous behavior out will cause a small change in some of these guys. Maybe the next woman will be treated just a little better.
And maybe not.
Still, it feels good to be more sure-footed in what my relationship and sexual boundaries are. My insecurities and uncertainties are still present, but I‚Äôm proud of myself for the progress I have made over the past several years.
If I can find this courage, truly ANYONE can!
I don‚Äôt always get the chance to say my peace. And that‚Äôs okay, too. Sometimes the best answer is to simply walk away.
But it‚Äôs healing when the opportunity presents itself to tell an uncaring/selfish person (whether you have known them for 2 days or 20 years):
No. You don‚Äôt get to treat me this way.
Bonnie was off the dating market from 1998 (when she met her now ex-husband) till early 2014. She has been online dating on-and-off for over 4 years. She has gone out on at least 100 first dates, interacted with over 1000 guys, and reviewed at least 10000 profiles. If there was a Masters in Online Dating, Bonnie‚Äôs earned it. This means: (1) That Bonnie is a failure at dating AND (2) She‚Äôs accumulated a lot of experiences and knowledge about the dating landscape for middle-aged chicks in Austin.
I know you are busy and have lots of ways you could be spending your time. You using your time to read my work means the world to me ‚Äî my sincerest thanks!

Rachel Clements|6.7K|7|https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-1-thing-all-happily-married-couples-have-in-common-b8fabbe53bbe?source=tag_archive---------9---------------------|The #1 Thing All Happily Married Couples Have in Common|"I read a lot about relationships.
Being a top writer in love, psychology, and relationships on Medium requires a lot of research when you‚Äôre not actually a psychologist (or married, for that matter).
Recently, I read a book called The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work by John Gottman and Nan Silver. Admittedly, I picked this title because my boyfriend and I plan on getting married soon, and, well, we‚Äôre really hoping to make it work.
The overall idea each of these principles (and every great psychology book I‚Äôve ever read) boils down to this:
According to Gottman and Silver, ‚ÄúFriendship fuels the flames of romance because it offers the best protection against feeling adversarial toward your spouse.‚Äù
Think about it: when you identify your partner as a best friend before a spouse, positive thoughts about him/her become overwhelming disproportionate to the negative thoughts. If you meet a friend for lunch and she forgot to order your sandwich without onion, would you give her ‚Äúthe look‚Äù or start shouting about how ‚Äúselfish and inconsiderate‚Äù she is for not remembering the way you like your sandwich? Of course not; you would you pick off the onions, make a joke about onion breath at the office, and thank her for buying lunch.
The positivity bias of a friendship makes it easy to look past mistakes or small frustrations. Positivity bias occurs when a relationship has had so many positive interactions that negative interactions can be chalked up to an anomaly. Instead of thinking your friend was careless enough to forget that you hate onions, you might attribute the careless mistake to the stress she‚Äôs been under at work lately instead.
Positivity bias makes it easy for both partners ‚Äúto feel optimistic about each other and their marriage, to assume positive things about their lives together, and to give each other the benefit of the doubt‚Äù (source).
The human attachment theory helps to explain the need for best friend behavior in a marital partnership. Research conducted on the attachment theory suggests that humans tend to attach themselves to one primary person when they are upset or scared. ‚ÄúRelationship partners are especially important when people are faced with a stressful event,‚Äù says social psychologist Paula Pietromonaco of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, ‚Äúbecause [partners] have the potential to comfort and calm the person who is experiencing distress or to hinder that person‚Äôs efforts to feel better.‚Äù (Science News)
In other words, happily married couples turn towards each other during an argument ‚Äî even if the argument is about each other ‚Äî because they prioritize each other‚Äôs sense of well-being.
Happily married couples find a way to calm each other down when an argument is escalating, either by making a joke, apologizing, offering a warm embrace, or simply by acknowledging that you both need some time to walk away and cool down.
...as long as you‚Äôve got enough resources to support each other‚Äôs dreams and sustain a desired quality of life. A best friend doesn‚Äôt mind paying for two concert tickets because he/she knows that a concert without their partner would suck. They also never make you feel bad if they pay more than you because they recognize the other ways you contribute to the partnership (i.e. manual labor, acts of kindness, doing the taxes...).
...because the most important part is simply hanging out together ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre sipping insta-worthy cocktails at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas or sharing leftovers out of a styrofoam box in a Motel 6.
...or whatever split both partners see as ‚Äúfair.‚Äù Some couples split household chores by task (I‚Äôll take care of the laundry if you mow the lawn), by day of the week, time of day, or simply by who gets home first. The point isn‚Äôt that the actual workload is split evenly between partners, but that there is a sense of equality in the effort contributed by each person. In fact, best friends may actually take on more chores voluntarily when their partner is feeling sick or stressed out, knowing that he/she would do the same if the roles were reversed. While it may seem uneven at the time, best-friend-first couples trust that this temporary imbalance of effort will even out over the course of their lifetime.
...because you can openly communicate what you like in the bedroom. Couples that are friends before lovers feel a sense of gratification when they play a role in their partner‚Äôs sexual satisfaction; they view sex as a two-player game where the object is not to ‚Äòwin‚Äô, but for both players to have as much fun as possible playing the game. What fun is it unless your best friend is having fun, too?
...and emotionally connected 99% of the time. There might be a few slip-ups here and there (even the most loyal friendships endure forgotten birthdays once in a while) but best-friend-first couples pride themselves on knowing details of one another‚Äôs individual lives. Best friends check in with each other daily to find out how they are feeling, what kind of stresses they‚Äôre facing, and if there is anything they currently need or want. Best friends know each other‚Äôs biggest dreams, inquire about their progress, and celebrate every win (big and small).
...because all couples argue, whether they are happily married or on the brink of divorce. Couples who identify as best friends first, though, fight productively ‚Äî that is, they fight with the intention of resolving a conflict instead of fighting solely to feel emotionally connected. Best friends also respect each other‚Äôs style of fighting as much as they can emotionally handle. The way best-friend couples fight is no different than any other marriage; some people like to retreat for clarity during conflict while others like to confront issues head-on until it‚Äôs resolved. The difference is that best-friend couples have found a way to fight about issues in a way that incorporates both partner‚Äôs style of processing emotions.
Could it really be that simple, though?
According to my grandma, a recent widow after 62 years of marriage with my grandfather, yes ‚Äî as long as you work at remaining best friends throughout the years.
‚ÄúI thought he was the cutest thing on earth,‚Äù she laughed, her eyes lighting up at the memory of meeting my grandfather back in 1956.
If you feel like your relationship is more of a partnership than a friendship, shift your perspective to think, act, and respond the way you would to a best friend.
One of my favorite exercises for cultivating a sense of friendship in your relationship is to act like a puppy (i.e. man‚Äôs best friend) when your partner gets home from work. Get excited! Give them slobbery, passionate kisses, nuzzle your nose in the collar of their shirt, squeeze them in a hug until your arms ache, and tell them how glad you are to be reunited with your best friend in the whole wide world.
As an unknown source once said,
Happily ever after doesn‚Äôt start with a champagne toast at a wedding; it starts the moment you turn towards your partner and realize you‚Äôre looking into the eyes of your very best friend.

He flies under the radar compared to other men. You‚Äôre not that attracted ‚Äî he‚Äôs irritatingly intellectual, a total nerd, somewhat of a killjoy.
But you reconnect later. Maybe it‚Äôs days later, maybe it‚Äôs a year.
He reaches out because of something interesting you wrote. It‚Äôs your writing, it‚Äôs always your writing that draws them in.
He‚Äôs not your usual type, so you have no plans to fall in love.
You discover: he‚Äôs interesting, he‚Äôs fascinating, he might very well be a genius. When he talks about data sets, somehow it‚Äôs poetry to your ears. His hobbies are unexpected and wide-ranging: philosophy, fishing, tango.
He was a terrible student in high school, yet highly accomplished outside of it. Maybe he traveled across Europe for chess tournaments, or around the U.S. for tennis championships, or spent long hours sketching art in a black sketch book.
There was one teacher in particular that believed in him, and that made all the difference.
He‚Äôs extraordinarily successful, astonishingly well-connected. If he was bored in school, he‚Äôs been challenged like no other in his career. He has driven an original idea or ambition to completion, with a discipline and willpower you can only imagine, achieved what most humans could only dream of.
And yet the more successful and brilliant he is in a particular area, the more awkward and incompetent he is in the most basic of others: he forgets to eat, he can‚Äôt pick out his own clothes, he can‚Äôt boil an egg.
But you smile when you learn of these quirks. You find them endearing.
He finds himself talking to you a lot, telling you things he has never told anyone else. You both conclude this must mean your connection is special. He cares about his mom, and his brother or his sister, but he fought a lot with his dad. His dad was narcissistic and cruel, and it‚Äôs an emotional scar that still wounds him today.
He‚Äôs got a penchant for logic games, and he speaks multiple languages. French, German, Japanese ‚Äî you will be entranced the first time you hear him speak another language, amazed by the worlds he floats effortlessly into that you could never know.
He‚Äôs a mathematician, analytical, an engineer, a hacker ‚Äî but above all, he loves to solve problems. There‚Äôs no problem he can‚Äôt solve or won‚Äôt try. To hack his brain, simply suggest a hypothetical problem and watch his mind spin in search of a solution.
He admits that he works a lot, he doesn‚Äôt meet a lot of women, but he‚Äôs looking for the right woman: smart, driven, beautiful. Not one for online dating or apps, he hates dating, and he‚Äôs frustrated and clueless.
You‚Äôre puzzled as to why. There is an aura of mystique that surrounds him when you meet, a kind of power and presence in his energy that he isn‚Äôt even aware of, and that is exactly what makes him so intriguing.
He may unexpectedly sweep you off your feet with his depth, his intensity, his thoughtfulness. Watch him when he‚Äôs lost in thought, for that faraway yet intent look in his eyes.
Suddenly you will find yourself in love with this strange but brilliant man.
When it comes to smart, introverted men, you may very well be the only woman they have liked in awhile. Fatally shy, they may never ask you out.
But if they do, each and every one of them will be almost comically nervous around you. Their hearts will race like crazy the first time they hold your hand, walking along the city‚Äôs waterfront under a starlit night sky.
You will hear the same words over and over from them: You are amazing, you are beautiful, you are gorgeous. Your skin is so soft, you feel so good, we fit so well together.
They say that they love you and that they care a lot about you. Perhaps you decide, against your better judgment, yes, why not, you would like to go on a crazy journey together.
Congratulations: you will know a depth and intensity of a connection few would think possible.
Every time, it‚Äôs the little things that make you love him even more. He‚Äôs attentive to detail, gracefully anticipates your needs. Oddly neurotic in the strangest of ways: afraid of heights, of germs, sensitive to sounds. You‚Äôve never met someone with his sleep patterns: he sleepwalks, he needs very little sleep, he‚Äôs out like a light.
Mostly, he just wants to make you happy. He loves to be with you, just to hear you talk.
You will laugh together, play together, dream up inspiring futures together. In the span of a few minutes, you can shift easily from giggling like silly 4-year-olds to discussing the troubling impact of AI on our species.
You‚Äôll make love. You‚Äôll fuck. Relax blissfully into each other‚Äôs arms. Lulled into a sense of home.
You will know a oneness that transcends worlds, and words.
One day, he will decide to leave you. It will be sudden and swift with no warning.
Troubled at last by doubt, terrified that committing any further will hurt you, triggered by personal traumas, he will decide, quietly, independently ‚Äî because that is how he has solved every problem ‚Äî that it‚Äôs over.
He‚Äôll miss your insights. Your freewheeling conversations. But that‚Äôs it.
His willpower and discipline means you will never hear from him again. The linearity of his mind means he will conclude, like a logic game, you were not meant to be.
He will not look back, QED.
You will never really know why. You will be haunted for days, months, even years. Till the end of time.
When you meet such a man, do not fall in love. You will be demolished, devastated, systematically destroyed, yet again, by yet another smart, introverted man.
Every single time.

Because it‚Äôs mostly shit advice.
Here‚Äôs a small sampling:
This is infatuation.
If someone‚Äôs ‚Äúalways‚Äù on your mind, you‚Äôre not focused on other Really Important Things. And that‚Äôs a problem.
Real love fits into real life, rather than usurping it. It‚Äôs calm, not overwhelming.
See above.
Ditto.
Well, I mean, damn. You fantasize long and hard enough, you can see anything in your future ‚Äî like I could imagine moving to Switzerland to be a goat farmer. That doesn‚Äôt mean I should.
The problem is that we‚Äôve made ‚Äúlove‚Äù into a game of escapism, and measure potential partners by how they fit into that fantasy. That‚Äôs not love.
So, sure, see them in your future ‚Äî but not because they ‚Äúcomplete the picture.‚Äù
See above.
Ha. Hahaha. Clearly you have never been in a (healthy) long-term relationship.
You should usually want to see bae. But love isn‚Äôt always wanting to. Sometimes you need a minute. Sometimes you need to work or do other things. Or, damn, just be.
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs not love just because sometimes you want space.
Well. That‚Äôs scary.
Y u tryin so hard? Loving isn‚Äôt ‚Äúimpressing.‚Äù
Healthy love doesn‚Äôt involve fear of loss. That‚Äôs attachment.
It also doesn‚Äôt involve fear of ‚Äúnever being with another woman.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know what that is. Low self esteem? Lack of conviction?
This is attachment again, not mature love.
This is self-love, not love. (Also: you‚Äôre an idiot.)
Well. Glad you‚Äôre getting your emotional needs met.
But this just means that they are deserving of love. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you are loving them.
Well. Thanks for the most unhelpful advice ever.
To everyone who‚Äôs ever said this: y tho? pls stahp.
Don‚Äôt perpetuate nonsense and call it ‚Äúromance‚Äù just because you don‚Äôt have suitable answers.
The difference here is probably what the rest of your day looks like.
Good: If you‚Äôre happy with your life and your partner adds to it, then congrats. You win.
Bad: If you‚Äôre unhappy and using your partner as an oasis, then you need to get your shit together.
Good: you actually care about their wants and needs, and prioritize them in a way that doesn‚Äôt tear you down
Bad: you compromise your own wants and needs, or base your value on your ability to ‚Äúkeep them happy.‚Äù
Rad for them
Congrats, there may be hope for you yet.
Great. I want happiness for most people.
You found someone with whom you‚Äôre comfortable, and whose company you enjoy. Good on you.
Role models have that effect on us, too. That doesn‚Äôt mean we love them.
You don‚Äôt feel love. You DO it. It‚Äôs an act, not a feeling. It‚Äôs a moment by moment decision and re-commitment. You know because it‚Äôs deliberate and conscious.
You invest. You exert effort.
You don‚Äôt knowingly do harm. You aren‚Äôt vengeful, petty, manipulative, or jealous. Their needs never seem irritating. You aren‚Äôt grabby with them, their time, or their affection in return. You are secure without demanding constant reassurance.
You prioritize their viewpoints. You learn their love language. You think in terms of their interests, not yours, and their needs are your own. You support them. You back them. You care and take care. You accept, and you allow.
Because everyone thinks they‚Äôre in love when it‚Äôs clear skies and calm waters, but watch them when the storm hits.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre pissed. It‚Äôs love if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúfight;‚Äù you disagree.
You love if your objective is reaching an agreement, not picking a winner.
You love if you don‚Äôt get defensive, insecure, or manipulative. If you don‚Äôt keep score. If you don‚Äôt hold grudges. If you don‚Äôt ‚Äútake back your love‚Äù as punishment.
You love if you seek to understand before being understood; listen and honor what they share ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt double down with your own issues. If you act like you‚Äôre on the same team. You listen. You compromise. You apologize. You forgive.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre hurt. Especially honoring and respecting their wants and needs even when they include ‚Äúbreaking up.‚Äù
We like to differentiate between ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù and ‚Äúloving‚Äù someone. But ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù is infatuation, and infatuation means nothing in getting real love.
So if what you want is real love, then ‚Äúhow to‚Äù is all that matters.
You ‚Äúknow‚Äù because you decide. It‚Äôs love when you do it. All the time.

Rachel Clements|6.7K|7|https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-1-thing-all-happily-married-couples-have-in-common-b8fabbe53bbe?source=---------2---------------------|The #1 Thing All Happily Married Couples Have in Common|"I read a lot about relationships.
Being a top writer in love, psychology, and relationships on Medium requires a lot of research when you‚Äôre not actually a psychologist (or married, for that matter).
Recently, I read a book called The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work by John Gottman and Nan Silver. Admittedly, I picked this title because my boyfriend and I plan on getting married soon, and, well, we‚Äôre really hoping to make it work.
The overall idea each of these principles (and every great psychology book I‚Äôve ever read) boils down to this:
According to Gottman and Silver, ‚ÄúFriendship fuels the flames of romance because it offers the best protection against feeling adversarial toward your spouse.‚Äù
Think about it: when you identify your partner as a best friend before a spouse, positive thoughts about him/her become overwhelming disproportionate to the negative thoughts. If you meet a friend for lunch and she forgot to order your sandwich without onion, would you give her ‚Äúthe look‚Äù or start shouting about how ‚Äúselfish and inconsiderate‚Äù she is for not remembering the way you like your sandwich? Of course not; you would you pick off the onions, make a joke about onion breath at the office, and thank her for buying lunch.
The positivity bias of a friendship makes it easy to look past mistakes or small frustrations. Positivity bias occurs when a relationship has had so many positive interactions that negative interactions can be chalked up to an anomaly. Instead of thinking your friend was careless enough to forget that you hate onions, you might attribute the careless mistake to the stress she‚Äôs been under at work lately instead.
Positivity bias makes it easy for both partners ‚Äúto feel optimistic about each other and their marriage, to assume positive things about their lives together, and to give each other the benefit of the doubt‚Äù (source).
The human attachment theory helps to explain the need for best friend behavior in a marital partnership. Research conducted on the attachment theory suggests that humans tend to attach themselves to one primary person when they are upset or scared. ‚ÄúRelationship partners are especially important when people are faced with a stressful event,‚Äù says social psychologist Paula Pietromonaco of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, ‚Äúbecause [partners] have the potential to comfort and calm the person who is experiencing distress or to hinder that person‚Äôs efforts to feel better.‚Äù (Science News)
In other words, happily married couples turn towards each other during an argument ‚Äî even if the argument is about each other ‚Äî because they prioritize each other‚Äôs sense of well-being.
Happily married couples find a way to calm each other down when an argument is escalating, either by making a joke, apologizing, offering a warm embrace, or simply by acknowledging that you both need some time to walk away and cool down.
...as long as you‚Äôve got enough resources to support each other‚Äôs dreams and sustain a desired quality of life. A best friend doesn‚Äôt mind paying for two concert tickets because he/she knows that a concert without their partner would suck. They also never make you feel bad if they pay more than you because they recognize the other ways you contribute to the partnership (i.e. manual labor, acts of kindness, doing the taxes...).
...because the most important part is simply hanging out together ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre sipping insta-worthy cocktails at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas or sharing leftovers out of a styrofoam box in a Motel 6.
...or whatever split both partners see as ‚Äúfair.‚Äù Some couples split household chores by task (I‚Äôll take care of the laundry if you mow the lawn), by day of the week, time of day, or simply by who gets home first. The point isn‚Äôt that the actual workload is split evenly between partners, but that there is a sense of equality in the effort contributed by each person. In fact, best friends may actually take on more chores voluntarily when their partner is feeling sick or stressed out, knowing that he/she would do the same if the roles were reversed. While it may seem uneven at the time, best-friend-first couples trust that this temporary imbalance of effort will even out over the course of their lifetime.
...because you can openly communicate what you like in the bedroom. Couples that are friends before lovers feel a sense of gratification when they play a role in their partner‚Äôs sexual satisfaction; they view sex as a two-player game where the object is not to ‚Äòwin‚Äô, but for both players to have as much fun as possible playing the game. What fun is it unless your best friend is having fun, too?
...and emotionally connected 99% of the time. There might be a few slip-ups here and there (even the most loyal friendships endure forgotten birthdays once in a while) but best-friend-first couples pride themselves on knowing details of one another‚Äôs individual lives. Best friends check in with each other daily to find out how they are feeling, what kind of stresses they‚Äôre facing, and if there is anything they currently need or want. Best friends know each other‚Äôs biggest dreams, inquire about their progress, and celebrate every win (big and small).
...because all couples argue, whether they are happily married or on the brink of divorce. Couples who identify as best friends first, though, fight productively ‚Äî that is, they fight with the intention of resolving a conflict instead of fighting solely to feel emotionally connected. Best friends also respect each other‚Äôs style of fighting as much as they can emotionally handle. The way best-friend couples fight is no different than any other marriage; some people like to retreat for clarity during conflict while others like to confront issues head-on until it‚Äôs resolved. The difference is that best-friend couples have found a way to fight about issues in a way that incorporates both partner‚Äôs style of processing emotions.
Could it really be that simple, though?
According to my grandma, a recent widow after 62 years of marriage with my grandfather, yes ‚Äî as long as you work at remaining best friends throughout the years.
‚ÄúI thought he was the cutest thing on earth,‚Äù she laughed, her eyes lighting up at the memory of meeting my grandfather back in 1956.
If you feel like your relationship is more of a partnership than a friendship, shift your perspective to think, act, and respond the way you would to a best friend.
One of my favorite exercises for cultivating a sense of friendship in your relationship is to act like a puppy (i.e. man‚Äôs best friend) when your partner gets home from work. Get excited! Give them slobbery, passionate kisses, nuzzle your nose in the collar of their shirt, squeeze them in a hug until your arms ache, and tell them how glad you are to be reunited with your best friend in the whole wide world.
As an unknown source once said,
Happily ever after doesn‚Äôt start with a champagne toast at a wedding; it starts the moment you turn towards your partner and realize you‚Äôre looking into the eyes of your very best friend.

Kris Gage|1.5K|10|https://medium.com/@krisgage/we-warp-attraction-exaggerate-feelings-3ba27a006f54?source=---------3---------------------|We Warp Attraction & Exaggerate Feelings ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"One of the men in one of my groups of friends stares at one of the women in the group. A lot.
When others are engrossed in conversation, he‚Äôs looking at her. When we‚Äôre all laughing, he‚Äôs glancing to make sure she is too. When we‚Äôve all floated to different areas of a room, he‚Äôs watching her from across it. This ever-attentive, open but empty expression that isn‚Äôt interrupted even when others see it.
And I‚Äôve noticed this partly because he does it in front of everyone... but mostly I‚Äôve noticed because the woman is me.
We can‚Äôt speak with any real authority on others‚Äô feelings ‚Äî we can only ever really speak for our own (and sometimes we‚Äôre not even sufficiently equipped for that) ‚Äî but we can observe other people‚Äôs behavior, so I can point out that he is staring, for sure. And because I am a social creature and adult person, I can also take a pretty good speculative stab, with pretty decent conviction, as to why.
And I have a few thoughts around this:
It‚Äôs ‚Äúflattering,‚Äù sure, but being on the receiving end of admiration as a static object of desire is borrrrrrring. This guy isn‚Äôt on my radar because I‚Äôm ‚Äúflattered‚Äù ‚Äî that‚Äôs dumb and boring as hell.
He‚Äôs on my radar because of how he goes about it. He doesn‚Äôt just make a few casual comments like most human beings would with their friends, or sneak a lingering goodbye hug like most human beings would with their friends, or strike up a conversation like most human beings would with their friends, or shake it off like most human beings would with their friends. He doesn‚Äôt even have an expression that reads predatorial or anything particular ‚Äî no, instead this guy comes at it like a 7th grader in band camp, with this face that is equal parts pain and intrigue. All the time. And I know what‚Äôs sitting there untouched.
I like flirtation and I especially like flirtation with elements of control and power (but only if I have it ‚Äî see below) and, given what could be done with expressions like his, and the fact that he could be roughed up with as little as the right glance or two words... it‚Äôs titillating.
But this is just the ‚Äúanimal‚Äù me talking; not the logical, social creature or the authentic, intellectual human being who likes my partner so much more.
So mostly, I feel a little put out. Like,
This is the irritating part. The part where boundaries get blurred and his problem becomes work for me. Because since he can‚Äôt get his fantasy under wraps, his thoughts and emotions and attractions have seeped over and become something I have to play defense against.
Before, we could interact like normal people, but now I have to carefully stamp out the embers where I find them, pouring cold water over the char and fanning energy in other directions.
And therein lies the responsibility we create for others, like walking up to someone and asking, ‚Äúwill you hold this real quick? I took on more than I can carry.‚Äù
And of course, I could just go on doing my thing as I see fit and let him deal. Except it‚Äôs not that simple. Especially between women.
I know this mostly because I see the way she glances over at him throughout the night ‚Äî I see her scrutinizing, checking in. I watch her watching him watch me.
And if she knows, then we all know. And yet we all go on pretending not to know, not saying it out loud (at least not between me and either of them.) These are the social dances we play.
I‚Äôm not sure what his motivation is, or what it‚Äôs based on, or what he plans to do with this thing he‚Äôs clearly feeding by watching me while we‚Äôre together.
Not that it matters...
I mean, it‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù in the sense that he feels it. It‚Äôs real in the sense that he‚Äôs a real person and I‚Äôm a real person. But also it‚Äôs largely fabricated fantasy ‚Äî because things like this (crushes, superficial attraction, idealizations, etc.) always are.
And mostly I‚Äôm laughing. In the way we think it‚Äôs funny when someone else gets a flat tire or gets locked out of their apartment. I‚Äôm laughing in a way that‚Äôs actually thinking:
Because of course I‚Äôve been there before. And while I can‚Äôt speak on the specificities of whatever‚Äôs in his head, I can speak with great authority on my own experience of crushes.
I used to describe my crushes and infatuation as ‚Äúexquisite agony.‚Äù I probably still would, if I indulged them. But they now belong better to earlier eras.
There were, of course, the sort of elementary school playground crushes that were mostly based on archetypes (the class clown, the quiet one, the sporty one, etc. ‚Äî shit some grown-ass adults still haven‚Äôt grown out of), but my first real crush was in high school. I‚Äôd known him since middle school, we ran in the same friend group, and he was a musician and I went to his shows. We kissed in his car once ‚Äî it was terrible and we both hated it ‚Äî but he still asked me to Homecoming. It was ‚Äúas a friend,‚Äù and he made it pretty clear afterwards that that wasn‚Äôt changing, and I didn‚Äôt disagree. And yet, for whatever reason, I was hung up on this kid I barely even liked, and one night I journaled,
That kid has long since faded from memory (and any semblance of emotion) and there have since been other crushes. But at the earliest sign of fantasy, I quickly bundle them up real tight and ship them off down the river with the same mentality I had in high school: no thank you; not this.
Which is to say: I avoid them.
In the same sense that I stamp out others‚Äô embers, I stamp my own out too, shuffling things around to keep energy from building, distancing myself to air it out.
I don‚Äôt like the way I feel or act ‚Äî I either become ineffective and off-putting, making awkward outbursts, or I act like a dick. And I don‚Äôt like either of those behaviors.
But mostly, I don‚Äôt like the loss of control. I don‚Äôt feed crushes for the same reason I don‚Äôt ride my motorcycle at 120 mph or take blind corners at 45 degrees. I don‚Äôt indulge in fantasies for the same reason that I don‚Äôt wear roller skates instead of shoes. I don‚Äôt like crushes in the same way I freak out if I can‚Äôt leave a social setting when I want to.
Ironically, the only time I indulge in infatuation is when I have a committed partner and we‚Äôre monogamous for a while. That‚Äôs my prime time; my power hour; the point when indulgence feels safe and secure. And even then, I pick partners who won‚Äôt run rampant with my feelings and bake elaborate 4-tier cakes out of them; who won‚Äôt make montages of our memories and freak me out. And even even then, I keep most of mine under wraps (i.e., on paper.)
I have felt the frenzy of fantasy but don‚Äôt get off on it like others seem to, like Melissa Broder, who writes in ‚ÄúSo Sad Today,‚Äù
She‚Äôs right of course. Because we‚Äôre all avoiding something when it comes to crushes. We‚Äôre all dodging our feelings ‚Äî just in different ways.
And when we indulge crushes, we may be using people for the dopamine hit,but it‚Äôs:
It‚Äôs about you.
Melissa Broder loves limerence ‚Äî the feeling behind a crush; ‚Äúthe state of being infatuated or obsessed with another person, typically experienced involuntarily and characterized by a strong desire for reciprocation of one‚Äôs feelings.‚Äù
In her book ‚ÄúSo Sad Today,‚Äù she writes,
Which is precisely what we do.
You make them up.
...that‚Äôs self-inflicted.
Crushes are not ‚Äúreal;‚Äù they are fantasy. As Carl E Pickhardt Ph.D. wrote, in a crush, someone:
And these sort of feelings,
Pickhardt calls crushes an ‚Äúapproximation of love‚Äù ‚Äî which frankly seems like an insult ‚Äî to both crushes and real love. These are two separate animals, tethered together at the tail by only one thing: we lodge them in other people.
While love involves deep and meaningful connection, a crush is instead,
Which means it‚Äôs about us, and not them ‚Äî a big distinction between this and healthy love.
There are so many types of attraction. I wish we had more words for love ‚Äî even Spanish speakers differentiate between love for their family, love for their partner, ‚Äúlove‚Äù (which is not called ‚Äúlove‚Äù) for something like a spoon.But English speakers throw it all in together and bastardize the thing, everything from a new set of sneakers to our soulmate bestowed the same feeling and word.
I don‚Äôt just want more objective words for love, though ‚Äî a better breakdown of steps and areas of our lives. I want subjective words. I want more words like ‚Äúlimerence‚Äù and ‚Äúlust,‚Äù but many, many more of them ‚Äî tools with which to differentiate between real and unreal; healthy and unhealthy love.
I want better tools for understanding what we we‚Äôre in before either of us gets hit over the head with the hard facts on the other side.
So often everything in love ‚Äî start to finish ‚Äî is actually about us and not others.
After I broke up with a boyfriend of five years, he spent a year saying he wanted to get back together and waiting for me to come around ‚Äî but doing very little else by way of showing or convincing me things would change, or that he even perceived the problem as it pertained to him.
When I shared this with a friend over a beer, she looked at me and said,
She was right.
I wish I could claim that I understood this before she said it, or that perhaps this advice had been given the other way around ‚Äî that I‚Äôd been armed with this token of genius at that point in my life, lightly offering it to others ‚Äî but I was not. I have, however, since used this line over and over and over, sometimes with myself and sometimes with others, because:
People are always first motivated by themselves.
Exes don‚Äôt really miss each other ‚Äî they just miss the familiarity and comfort; they miss putting in as little effort as possible and their partners sticking around regardless.
Crushes don‚Äôt want each other ‚Äî they just want whatever they‚Äôve projected.
We don‚Äôt actually want the thing; we want its abstraction ‚Äî what it represents to us and the way it makes us feel.
Very little about our lives ‚Äî and love and lust and limerence ‚Äî is really about others. It‚Äôs almost always about us.
And there are a couple of things we can do with this:
Understanding the difference between love and not-love, but also understanding that we can love the complexities of the human spirit and the reasons for attraction; to feel compassion towards the human spirit and take care of that energy ‚Äî without necessarily legitimizing (or loving) everything messy that we make.
Or clap or follow!

And it‚Äôs ugly cousin phrase:
It‚Äôs not that I had never dated before or that every dude before him had been just as bad, because I had, and they weren‚Äôt.
It was more that many of my previous relationships ‚Äî especially my high school sweetheart, whom I adored ‚Äî were the makes of fantasy lands. We ‚Äúnever fought‚Äù and it was ‚Äúeasy‚Äù simply because we didn‚Äôt have a care in the world ‚Äî our entire universe consisted of little more than deciding where to eat lunch, which movie to watch, and who would finally hang up on the other ‚Äî after endless ‚ÄúI love you‚Äôs‚Äù ‚Äî first.
I knew I didn‚Äôt want to live forever on puppy love alone. I knew I wanted a grown-up partner. Someone I could be serious with. Someone who shared my aspirations. Someone with whom I could share real struggles. Someone who wanted more than to settle down into a white picket fenced house made of gingerbread and tickle fights.
And I thought being in an adult relationship meant taking the bad with the good, and that part of the bad meant ugly fighting and contempt.
Contempt is a red flag. Resentment is a red flag. Name-calling and low blows and emotional warfare are all loud and proud red flags.
Maybe this sounds obvious. Or maybe it sounds like fantasy. I can understand either way.
Because I‚Äôve certainly agreed with both at different points in my life. There have been times where I thought, ‚ÄúI would never be hateful towards my partner,‚Äù and other moments where I thought, ‚Äúeveryone hates their partner from time to time!‚Äù (Because, I mean come on ‚Äî it‚Äôs in the sitcoms! And if it‚Äôs good enough to be a running joke across all our mass media, I figured it was good enough for me.)
It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs not good, to fight this way. To see each other this way. To hate, even for a moment. There is a better version out there, and if you decide you want it hard enough, you can have it, too.
And after having it both ways, I can decidedly tell you: pervasive love and care and kindness ‚Äî pervasive even in times of anger or frustration or disappointment, and probably especially so! ‚Äî is totally and mind-blowingly worth it, and when you‚Äôre lucky enough to have it ‚Äî both extend it and receive it back ‚Äî you‚Äôll wonder how you ever almost settled for any other way.
All couples get upset. All people have disagreements, frustrations, human emotions that don‚Äôt perfectly coincide. The difference between ‚Äúgood‚Äù work and ‚Äúbad‚Äù is how you channel this, and whether you see each other as partners or opponents against whom you want to win, overpower, or be ‚Äúright.‚Äù
Not overall, anyway. Not when you stack everything up. When you measure everything at the end of the day, the good should decidedly ‚Äî immediately, irrevocably, undeniably ‚Äî outweigh the bad.
I‚Äôm not saying you should never feel hurt ‚Äî feeling sad or frustrated or mad or whatever is a normal part of being alive. Nobody is here to protect you from reality.
But overall, your relationship should be more good than bad ‚Äî and you shouldn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù yourself of the good, or fight to overlook the bad.
When you look at your relationship overall, it should bring you way more happiness than pain. Like way way more. Not all the time and not every moment and not every day or even every week or sometimes even for a whole month straight, in real bad times. Because ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre in it for the long haul ‚Äî y‚Äôall are going to hit some shit, and you have to be fair about that.
It‚Äôs not all cupcakes and rainbows, and it shouldn‚Äôt be. But when you look at the big picture, all at once, it should feel more good than bad.
The work should feel easy, composed, calm. It should be laying groundwork for the future and doing loving things in time of peace, not cleaning up after each other after blowing up in each other‚Äôs faces after bottling for loo long and then having to apologize.
And just to be clear: if you are extending 110% of the effort ‚Äî ‚Äúmore effort than them,‚Äù which is a red flag mindset all its own ‚Äî but are also the one blowing up sometimes, then you are part of the problem.
Don‚Äôt codependent at this. Don‚Äôt ‚Äúmanipulate‚Äù at this. Don‚Äôt emotional warfare. Don‚Äôt be the one who thinks you‚Äôre a great partner because you actively and aggressively show up most of the time ‚Äî if you‚Äôre also the one tearing it down some of the time.
Show up all the time. Show up even when you‚Äôre upset. Be proactive and put in the effort, especially when it matters most.
Future you will thank you.
You should want to put in the work ‚Äî in the same way you want to work on your car, or work out, or go through the painstaking task of making a butter pie crust from scratch, or whatever else it is that you enjoy.
My motorcycle is by far my favorite possession ‚Äî when asked what I would save if my house was on fire, I always ask, ‚Äúis the garage on fire, too?‚Äù That bike brings me insane amounts of joy.
And it‚Äôs literally not all sunshine and rainbows ‚Äî I ride in the rain on that bike. I ride in triple digits. I ride in single digits, as long as there‚Äôs no ice. I‚Äôll ride for 18 hours or 10 minutes. I‚Äôll take most any ride over no ride at all. And I get the bike fixed when it‚Äôs broken, which of course happens.
And I do all of it happily, never resentfully. Sure, riding in the rain isn‚Äôt as fun as riding in perfect weather, and fixing the bike isn‚Äôt as fun as riding it, but I like the bike so much that setbacks like these barely matter. They‚Äôre just part of it.
That‚Äôs what love feels like. And how ‚Äúwork‚Äù in love should feel.
It should take effort, but the effort shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù foremost like effort.
It should feel ‚Äî foremost ‚Äî like love.

Not in big ways, but rather infinite tiny ways. Little, countless cuts, every day.
For some us, we are that couple.
We tease. We complain. We ignore. We nitpick. We nag. We neg.
‚ÄúNegging,‚Äù (a play on ‚Äúdenigration‚Äù) for those not in the ‚Äúpickup‚Äù community (i.e., most of us), is when you deliberately cut someone down while flirting in order to lower their confidence. It‚Äôs for people who don‚Äôt have enough confidence of their own.
And while some people do it while flirting, there are way more of us who carry it on into our actual relationships and keep it going there, too. Except, in that space, we call it ‚Äúlove,‚Äù with it postured as though it‚Äôs ‚Äúloving‚Äù ‚Äî we‚Äôre all so quick to smile and nod and accept it as such ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs just a bad violation of boundaries, and insecurity.
In one case, one of our friends didn‚Äôt like her boyfriend‚Äôs shirt. Okay. But the worst part was that he‚Äôd deliberately tried to wear a shirt he thought she did like, thinking ‚Äúthe one she didn‚Äôt like‚Äù was a different one, but it turns out she didn‚Äôt like either one and by the sounds of it, the guy had really messed up. But it was a perfectly fine shirt ‚Äî some kind of on-trend but tasteful printed button-down anybody in my office could wear.
So while they were going back and forth, my partner and I were just sort of standing there like ‚Äúwow... who gives a damn?‚Äù
Don‚Äôt apologize for your partner‚Äôs ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù after they leave the room. It‚Äôs poor form pretty much no matter the reason.
Either way, apologizing for your partner undermines your ‚Äúpartner-hood.‚Äù
We were once out with friends and it was getting late, so one of the husbands politely said goodnight to the table, kissed his beloved wife goodbye, and headed out. The minute he was gone, she groaned, ‚Äúugh, sorry about him.‚Äù
I stared at her.
The dude hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong. He was a totally nice person who had been nothing but polite and was just ready to go to sleep. Which made herlook imbalanced and unfair in comparison.
If you‚Äôre apologizing on behalf of your partner the minute they step away, y‚Äôall need to stop. If you feel compelled to ‚Äúwin points‚Äù socially at the cost of your partner, you should seriously reevaluate your priorities.
The only time it‚Äôs really okay to apologize ‚Äúfor‚Äù your partner is if it was a one-time thing and your partner was really not in their right mind ‚Äî i.e., they would apologize too, if they could.
For example: one of my ex-boyfriends lost his mom (with whom he‚Äôd been very close) unexpectedly while we were dating. We were out to eat a few days later and he suddenly threw a fit at the table, then got up and stormed out of the restaurant.
I had known him a year at this point and had never seen him act this way ‚Äî on the contrary, he always valued social norms and polite behavior ‚Äî so I apologized to the server on his behalf as I paid our bill. Because that‚Äôs exactly what he would‚Äôve done, had he been his normal self, so apologizing in a case like this is being a unit.
There‚Äôs one thing everyone knows about my dad: the man loves cars.
During his teens and twenties he owned just about every classic car under the sun, starting from the white ‚Äô69 GTO Judge to the baby blue Corvette I recall from childhood. After the Corvette, he traded his keys in for slightly more reasonable family vehicles ‚Äî SUVs, pickups, a Jeep or two, one big ole Blazer.
And while his life was devoid of classic cars while he raised us, there has always been one thing Dad has talked about wanting in retirement: another classic car.
That‚Äôs it.
And it‚Äôs not so much that my mother would fight him on this (which is good, because if she tried, she‚Äôd have all five of his kids, who wholeheartedly have his back on this issue, to reckon with) ‚Äî but more that she‚Äôll allow it rather than embrace it.
I want to give her full credit here ‚Äî because she‚Äôs gone four-wheeling with him in the Jeep and has reported back that his other cars are ‚Äúfun to drive‚Äù (music to his ears.)
But my mother is also the sort of woman who thinks it‚Äôs okay for a spouse to act cooly towards their partner‚Äôs passion, to openly scoff and refuse to participate in any of the ancillary activities, like car shows ‚Äî in person, or on TV ‚Äî both of which my dad loves. It breaks my dad‚Äôs heart that she won‚Äôt join him, and that means it breaks each of ours.
Without regard for (or asking them to sacrifice) theirs.
One of the biggest ‚Äúanti-love‚Äù moves in the world is a marriage ultimatum.
We usually think of it as a fault of the person who didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúcommit‚Äù ‚Äî who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt love enough‚Äù to ‚Äúsettle down.‚Äù
But what if that‚Äôs not the case? What if they love their partner very, very much ‚Äî but don‚Äôt support the (possibly outdated) institution of marriage?
If it‚Äôs unloving for someone to risk losing their partner by refusing to get married...
...then it‚Äôs equally unloving for someone to risk losing their partner by demanding it.
In both cases, each person‚Äôs ideals around Marriage were more important to them than keeping their partner. So if it‚Äôs a matter of ‚Äúnot loving enough,‚Äù then neither of them did.
The Boy and I are both lukewarm on marriage. But if either of us wanted it badly enough, the other one would readily do it.
But conversely ‚Äî and this is important! ‚Äî we also both agree:
Neither of us would ever let the other person go just because they didn‚Äôt want to get married.
Because we both care about each other far more than we care about our stance on marriage, for or against.
And that‚Äôs whole lot closer to true love. And if we all want to admit and agree that marriage isn‚Äôt about love anyway, that‚Äôs totally fine. (Because it‚Äôs not.) But don‚Äôt combine the two in one conversation unless you‚Äôre honest about what you‚Äôre saying.
The problem is that love makes us feel insecure. We‚Äôre vulnerable, we‚Äôre exposed, we hang too much of our identity on our partner and we expect them to embody too much.
We get insecure and then we let that insecurity turn into hurting others.
Love is about starting to take responsibility and define better boundaries ‚Äî acknowledging what‚Äôs our domain and what isn‚Äôt, and identifying the real issue behind our ‚Äúissue‚Äù with stupid shit like shirts, or why publicly announcing that someone is the ‚Äúlove of your life‚Äù is more important than actually treating them like it.
There are actually a couple of things at play here, and the first thing is boundaries.
It‚Äôs not healthy to nitpick what shirt your spouse wants to wear ‚Äî especially if they specifically picked a shirt they thought you‚Äôd like. Your controlling behavior isn‚Äôt cute ‚Äî you‚Äôre being a monster.
Let them dress how they want to dress. It‚Äôs their body. They are not your public status symbol. They are a person.
This is the biggest thing.
Loving someone means honoring their values. It means celebrating and making space in your lives for the things that are important to them ‚Äî as long as those things are healthy.
As long as their interests aren‚Äôt gambling or strip clubs or drugs or booze or whatever else, I mean fuck man, let them have comic books! Let them buy the car! Let them bake and make dad jokes and wear the shirt they like that you hate.
In fact, no ‚Äî don‚Äôt just ‚Äúlet them‚Äù have these things ‚Äî because you don‚Äôt own them. Rather, encourage them to have ‚Äî support them in having ‚Äî these things that make their heart sing.
Because doing so ‚Äî and seeing how much happiness it brings them ‚Äî should make your heart happy in return.

Bonnie Barton|1.3K|6|https://psiloveyou.xyz/online-dating-vocabulary-what-you-need-to-know-e86c8a1b58cc?source=---------6---------------------|Online Dating Vocabulary: What You Need to Know ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"You KNOW you‚Äôve been in the online dating realm just a little too long when you can analyze these words, terms, and definitions and create a 1000+ word story! And that you could easily write even more!
(Bonnie shudders.)
Just another example of why dating in 2018 (and beyond ‚Äî 2019 is looming) is so challenging and tricky to navigate. Many of these words and terms have a different meaning outside of online dating.
These terms should be harmless. Or straight-forward. (Or never uttered outside of dating.)
This is by no means a complete list, but it‚Äôs a good starting point for understanding the true meaning behind vocabulary found in many online dating profiles.
Fun, adventurous, open-minded ‚Äî These have been hijacked by the online dating community. These typically refer to sex.
It‚Äôs like the old fortune cookie game where you add ‚Äúin bed‚Äù to your fortune. Most people are going to assume you mean ‚Äúfun, adventurous, and open-minded,‚Äù yes, ‚Äúin bed.‚Äù
Anal sex. Threesomes. S&M. Sex tapes. Yada, yada.
It‚Äôs cool if you‚Äôre into that, but if not, I would stay far away from those words in your profile.
Sapiosexual ‚Äî This has become the newest ‚Äú-sexual‚Äù craze and it‚Äôs got a few different definitions.
I define it as someone who is attracted to intelligence.
Folks incorrectly assume that a sapiosexual could care less about physical attraction. Au contraire!
I‚Äôm definitely a sapiosexual but also need to feel a physical connection to my date/suitor/beau.
An example of what being a sapiosexual is like: while on a date with a certain lanky Texan, he surprised me by talking about genetics (something science-y). I have zero interest in genetics, but it was titillating to hear him use big words and discuss complex concepts.
Ooo la la! Yep, I was turned on and started to blush. Over genetics, people!
That‚Äôs a sapiosexual, my friends.
If you bust out some SAT words and I am attracted to you, I‚Äôm going to be physically turned on, too.
An example of not being a sapiosexual: having a fantasy about a woman wearing glasses or acting like a secretary/librarian. That‚Äôs just a fetish or preference for glasses and/or secretaries. Sheesh! Stop calling yourself a sapiosexual.
(I happen to like lean guys in glasses. That‚Äôs not sapiosexuality. It might be sapiosexual-adjacent at best!)
Active Lifestyle ‚Äî One of my favorite Medium writers, Shani Silver, crafted an awesome story on this topic. I highly recommend it.
My additional thoughts: I think ‚Äúactive lifestyle‚Äù can be tricky because it might mean several things.
Yes, it might honestly mean that he‚Äôs an outdoorsy dude or spends a lot of time at the gym/playing sports and wants to be upfront about that. This guy might be a triathlete, cross-fitter, or have some other athletic hobby that takes up a large chunk of his life.
It also might mean that he leads a busy lifestyle and is looking for someone who prefers to be on-the-go rather than a homebody.
I‚Äôm inclined to agree with Shani, though, and think it is FAR more likely to mean that the dude places a lot of importance on the weight/physique of his potential suitor.
What he‚Äôs really saying by ‚Äúactive lifestyle‚Äù is that he expects his potential date to be a certain weight, to look a certain way. Period.
Divorced ‚Äî Perhaps. It‚Äôs best to double-check this one.
I understand why some guys put ‚Äúdivorced‚Äù when they are technically separated.
The attorneys have been engaged, the divorce papers filed, and separate residences are being maintained. Maybe a separation has been in place for years and/or the relationship has been platonic for a long time.
Nonetheless, I always ask guys if they are truly divorced (as opposed to ‚Äúcurrently separated‚Äù) and how long they have been divorced. These answers matter and can vary from what is on the profile.
Currently separated ‚Äî It‚Äôs your job to determine if he means: married and looking for a fling OR married but totally separated with a divorce on the horizon. (Or you can decide to pass hard on this category entirely.)
I promise to write a full story on my thoughts on the currently separated man, but for now I will simply say that I no longer date this category of guy even if the divorce is pending.
Looking for fun ‚Äî This guy has just given himself a free pass to treat you like an object and/or dismiss you as soon as he deems you no longer fun. You will have zero say in the matter.
I avoid this dude at all costs, but he‚Äôs perfect if you‚Äôre into a one-night stand or a brief fling.
Looking for a FWB (friend with benefits) ‚Äî Take this guy at his word. I have never entered into a FWB arrangement, but enough women have responded to my stories over the past year to confirm my suspicions.
The guy that says he wants a FWB arrangement is never going to make a commitment to you. Which might be fine if you don‚Äôt want a commitment either.
But please don‚Äôt delude yourself into entering this type of arrangement when you KNOW you want something more serious. You are going to end up disappointed at best and very hurt at worst.
Looking for fun but open to something more serious ‚Äî This guy is typically full of it. I have yet to meet a single guy who has written that in his profile decide to enter anything resembling a relationship.
Some guys write it with intent to deceive.
But others think they mean it (or might mean it), but once they meet someone else who is stable, attractive, and emotionally available for a relationship, they have a gut check.
They realize that, nope, they are not actually ready for a relationship.
Without fail I have had this happen.
I‚Äôm sure there are exceptions, but I share this as a major caveat.
Looking for a LTR (long term relationship) ‚Äî This guy is probably sincere. When I have interacted with guys that admit they are looking for something more serious, I have found them to be true to their word.
Again, I know that this is not an exhaustive list. Any other terms or definitions that I can illuminate? Please comment. And, of course, feel free to add your own term/definition in the comments section. We‚Äôre all in this crazy dating world together!

Crystal Jackson|309|3|https://psiloveyou.xyz/bring-me-fire-not-flowers-d47bc0dce754?source=---------7---------------------|Bring Me Fire, Not Flowers ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"We have broken at every love we‚Äôve had, until now. Maybe this will break us, too, but if this is our twin flame connection, may we grow stronger at our breaking points and hold together all the same. But we are here because nothing else has worked, no matter how hard we worked at making things work. We have been alone, and now we‚Äôre standing here, and I need to ask you to do something for me.
Bring me logs for the hearth fire that will keep me warm. Show up with your arms filled, and I don‚Äôt care if you chopped them up yourself, if your arms are tired and you still feel traces of the sweat that ran in rivulets down your back as you labored to show you could love me like that. Maybe you bought it from the store or picked them up on a walk through the woods. It only matters that I‚Äôve been cold for too long, and you didn‚Äôt want to show up empty-handed.
Sit with me by the fire, and we‚Äôll read awhile or stretch out together doing nothing at all but seeing how many ways our hands can come apart and fit back together. We can listen to records, and your fingers can twine through my hair. You will hand your stories to me gently, and I will cherish them. I will hand you mine, and you won‚Äôt use them to break me. We will watch the fire and feel it burn inside of us, warming rather than consuming.
Don‚Äôt buy me flowers; pick them for me, each one chosen by you just for me. Not for a special occasion but because you were walking, and you saw them, and suddenly, you could do nothing else but bring them to me.
Or better yet, take me there to see them with you. Walk with me in a garden with your hand in mine and love blooming in your eyes, reflecting skies that are blue or gray or coming down with rain that makes us run for cover, or stand there, dripping, holding each other without having to touch at all.
Don‚Äôt bring roses because you‚Äôve been told they mean love. Bring sunflowers because they mean love to me. Or daisies because you wanted to see me smile. Or orchids because our time together is precious. Or sprigs of lavender because I made it through a day I wasn‚Äôt sure I would.
But don‚Äôt show up and be somewhere else. Show up, and be present with me. No phones beep-beeping and no thoughts wandering to greener pastures somewhere else. No baggage you dragged from the last relationship and dumped at my door for me to deal with. Just you. Present. With me now.
That‚Äôs all I need.
We‚Äôve broken in every relationship before. I won‚Äôt ask you not to break me. I won‚Äôt ask you to make promises you don‚Äôt know yet if you will be able to keep.

Tesia Blake|6.8K|5|https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-7-signs-of-a-mature-love-550386260e7f?source=---------8---------------------|The 7 Signs Of A Mature Love ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"Mostly because we‚Äôre tricked into believing in the all the wrong markers of love. We‚Äôre tricked into believing real love is all about romance and grand gestures, that it‚Äôs about strong, passionate feelings that move you into doing things you never saw yourself doing before.
We believe Real Love is not only a thing, but that it‚Äôs signified by a fixed set of attitudes and values. We believe Real Love makes you want to spend every waking second next to your significant other, that it makes you jealous and deeply afraid that one misstep might cause you to lose the object of such passion.
There is no Real Love because it‚Äôs either love or it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs either love or it‚Äôs passion, possessiveness, an ego boost, or any other unhealthy relationship not marked by trust, respect and genuine giving.
There‚Äôs a palpable difference, however, between mature and immature love.
Here are the signs you have one:
As humans, it can be hard to talk about certain topics. In a relationship, conversation topics can range from what‚Äôs with that coworker you‚Äôre mad with, to that ex of your partner‚Äôs you‚Äôre still jealous of; from who should be doing the laundry this week, to why you‚Äôre afraid you might die alone; from why didn‚Äôt your partner call to let you know they were late, to how come you didn‚Äôt like their new haircut.
Being able to calmly talk with someone about what‚Äôs bothering you, outside and inside the relationship, is a precious gift. It goes beyond just being able to blurt out your unfiltered thoughts, in fact, it isn‚Äôt even about blurting out anything.
It‚Äôs about feeling safe and accepted. It‚Äôs about being individually mature enough to know how to articulate what troubles you and mature enough as a couple to know how to listen to each other.
It takes skill. It takes practice. But it‚Äôs a wonderfully beautiful thing to achieve.
Mature love is about spending quality time together, but it‚Äôs also about spending quality time apart.
Being alone is an essential human need. Time spent with ourselves, whether in silent reflection or engrossed in healthy activities we enjoy is time spent in self-improvement.
Healthy, mature couples use their respective alone time grow as individuals. They also take time to miss each other so that they can gladly meet again as improved individuals who can truly appreciate each other‚Äôs company.
When couples manage to respect each other‚Äôs need for alone time, neither being clingy or needy, demanding attention when the other can‚Äôt give it, then they know they have a mature love.
Just as with personal time, personal space is a human necessity.
Sure, mature couples can talk about anything and everything, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they should be in each other‚Äôs business all the time. Each person in a couple has their own time to process things, and each one knows which subjects they need to share and which subjects they need to keep to themselves.
When couples are able to respect each other‚Äôs personal space, the relationship grows stronger because it means that anything that‚Äôs shared is shared voluntarily, and that makes all the difference.
Having friends outside the couple doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs something lacking in the relationship.
Humans are social creatures, we‚Äôre not supposed to rely on a single person to satisfy all our needs. That‚Äôs why our relationships with family, coworkers, friends and significant others are shaped so differently: because they are different relationships with different people. Each has its own dynamic.
It‚Äôs healthy for a couple to have individual friends outside of the relationship. To be able to go out, share experiences and come back renewed, loaded with stories to share.
Respect, more than communication, is the basis for any healthy relationship.
When couples respect each other as individuals, they cultivate patience and understanding. When respect is present there is no fear of how one might react when approached with a problem, a dilemma, or any dark issue.
Where there‚Äôs no respect there‚Äôs no maturity. Where there‚Äôs no respect there can hardly be any love.
In a mature love, trust is essential.
When you cultivate respect and openness, you cultivate trust. When you know you can open up to each other on any issue, you eliminate doubt. What‚Äôs left is a blissful state of mind that only absolute trust can provide. There‚Äôs calm, there‚Äôs tranquility, and there‚Äôs a sense of safety characteristic of mature love.
And it is wonderful.
The reason why couples in mature relationships have an easy time respecting each other‚Äôs need for personal space, for alone time and for friends outside of the couple is that they know they will always come back to each other.
They know that if they don‚Äôt nurture their relationship, it will wither and die. They understand that the purpose of a relationship is to fulfill their partners needs before they seek to fulfill their own.
Giving, not taking, is the purpose of a mature relationship.
Having a mature relationship is no guarantee against the hardships of life. There will be disagreements, there will be hard times, but the difference in a mature relationship is in how the couple deals with these obstacles: with dialog and respect.
If you recognize your relationship as a mature one, congratulations. If you don‚Äôt yet, don‚Äôt worry, you can work your way there one step at a time.
Names and dates have been altered to protect the privacy of those involved.

Shani Silver|565|4|https://medium.com/@shanisilver/the-madness-inspired-by-men-who-dont-write-back-on-tinder-20f9226b0151?source=---------9---------------------|The Madness Inspired By Men Who Don‚Äôt Write Back On Tinder|"We‚Äôre never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy.
The definition of insanity is repeating the same behavior over and over expecting different results. Or, if you‚Äôre me, it just means you use Tinder. There‚Äôs a lot about this hellapp to be confused by, but the one genuinely perplexing behavior, the one that really drives me to draw on the walls with lipstick, is the fact that no matter what I say, no matter who I say it to, none of the men I match with ever, ever write back.
I‚Äôve always had a pretty crap ratio of messages sent to messages responded to. It was a little better when there was a ‚Äú2‚Äù in front of my age as opposed to a ‚Äú3,‚Äù but we all know that men essentially just want to date a frozen time capsule of the girl who sat in front of them in English 101 freshman year literally for the rest of their lives, so that is to be expected. I‚Äôve tried everything, I‚Äôm a writer for goodness sake, but no matter what, the silence of nonresponse is, quite honestly, impressive.
Can I ask, what are we doing here? If we‚Äôre not on this app to actually communicate with and meet other human beings, why then do we use it? What, for the love of waffle fries can someone please tell me what is the point of swiping right on someone, matching with them, and then just never responding to their goddamned message ever into infinity?
But Shani, maybe you‚Äôd just have better luck if you wait for the men to say hello to you first?
OMG great plan, why don‚Äôt I do that and you take to the forrest in search of your fairy godmother and we‚Äôll see who gets what they want first, hmm? Men do not say hello first. Ever. Unless to say ‚Äúyou up?‚Äù at 4am on a Sunday morning and should therefore be penned, like cattle, until they expire of natural causes.
Not only do they not say hello first, but they don‚Äôt say hello second, either. They don‚Äôt say anything at all. They just become a string of 50 (yes fucking 50) unanswered messages in a row on an app that runs on an algorithm of lies. Is no one else screaming into their laptop right now? Just me? Cool.
It‚Äôs actual madness! Hey, let‚Äôs use an app but then not use an app, you know? It‚Äôll be so fun, you just swipe right on all these chicks and then when they send you a message you just ignore them. Bro, it‚Äôs awesome ‚Äî hurry up we‚Äôre late for Crossfit.
I do not understand this lack of logic. I‚Äôve tried, dear Bowie in heaven I‚Äôve tried, to make sense of it. But the volume, the simple numbers involved make it statistically impossible that all of these men just ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt see the message,‚Äù ‚Äúdeleted the app six months ago,‚Äù ‚Äújust kind of changed his mind about you, you know?‚Äù
Someone, some person has to write back. Otherwise all we‚Äôre really doing is dumping photos of ourselves into a festering bucket of nothing and giving our right thumbs a workout on occasion. There is absolute lunacy in spending our time this way. It is a straight jacket that fits terribly and smells of stale Jameson.
But Tinder is there. It‚Äôs always there, like a mer-temptress beckoning you into deep, dark water. The app exists, and if it exists, that must mean it ‚Äúworks.‚Äù You can‚Äôt do nothing, you have to try. If you don‚Äôt try, nothing will ever happen, and then nothing happens when you try.
Maybe this is just the way it is, and accepting that will service the insanity heaped upon me by a thing built with ones and zeroes. Maybe the little red square on my phone can‚Äôt hurt me. Maybe there‚Äôs no solution except the one that sounds crazy. Maybe dating apps are crazy. Maybe we‚Äôre all just a little mad here.

To any mind who approaches love with logic, it makes perfect sense: online dating gives you access to a large pool of candidates, and potentials to reach individuals that you would otherwise have no chance of meeting. The attractive stranger in the coffee shop is not so strange and distant when they‚Äôre within the touch of your swiping motion on your phone; the people so out of your normal social circle just one witty text away to being part of your life. The bio of the profiles allows one to filter through some basic preferences you may have for a partner, such as education, hobbies, or whatever it is that matters to you. My personal quirk for Tinder was that I was never going to swipe right on a man who had a picture of him holding a fish. For my lesbian friend, no Geminis.
The process afterwards seems logical too: you carry on conversations on whatever photos or small excerpts of your life you chose to share on your profile, either hitting it off right away or scrape through the dry conversation to the best of your ability till it comes to a crumbled end. Small talks seem inescapable unless you‚Äôre one to dive into exploring your philosophy to life and trauma in the first ten texts ‚Äî which can be a successful hook or a sure rejection. Then you move on to the dates; you either enjoy yourself or feel like you wasted hours of your time. Rinse and repeat, to either come to a natural end and start over in the process, or, congratulations! You have found your one. The assembly line never ends until the one fated meeting.
I have met a fair number of couples who are happily in love and have met off platforms like Tinder; some of them are my best friends. Seeing their happiness blooming from unlikely probabilities and as my parents continue to send me articles with titles like, ‚ÄúHow to Find the One for You‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy Dating is a Necessity‚Äù on a weekly basis, I kicked myself in the butt and get on this process as well. Among all the other aspects of life, I felt like I wasn‚Äôt doing enough unless I hopped on this method of dating.
Soon enough I broke my rule to never reply to anyone on Tinder and my original intention of only using the app for external validation (that I was not hopeless and there are individuals who walk this earth that find me desirable), and did the things you were supposed to do ‚Äî engage online, and then in real life, and hope for something. Anything.
The process is quite mechanical and the app hopping never stops; I don‚Äôt like hook-ups, and soon found Tinder to not be the app for me. I‚Äôm not great at initiating conversations, so Bumble was no-go either. My friend suggested the League; I did not find the appeal of a dating platform built to have an exclusive user base, and didn‚Äôt have much interest. Finally a guy who sits near me at work suggested Hinge for more serious dating, and that was my last dating app hop.
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs myself personally or it‚Äôs just that everyone is in on the joke and I‚Äôm out of it ‚Äî but I have never hated any process more than that of online dating.
The frustrations seem so endless. For one, you are, in the end, an easily replaceable being that exists on a non-physical medium to individuals who examine your profile. There‚Äôs often no sense of responsibility to you, and this lack of responsibility extends to even when you finally meet each other in the physical presence. It is far too easy to lose someone in a large city, someone who has no other connection to your circle than the tangential line of the dating app match, free to extend to nothingness in your world. ‚ÄúGhosting‚Äù is too easy for you and the other person, and even though you know it hurts, you will do it too.
All the good conversations that seem to die right on your phone; all the people you have had the pleasure or displeasure of meeting, the period written by unmatching, deleting, or even blocking. The ease that allows one to terminate the fleeting connection right away, because in the pool of open access to anyone, it means that your time and presence is easily replaced by the next best option. And it isn‚Äôt just the person on the other end doing this; it is also myself, looking at the messages that I have yet to reply to, and feeling all too tired to think of another witty response, and waiting for the next match that would inevitably come with time.
Is online dating really that much less personal and impactful? I think about the individuals that I did develop feelings for. I met them through friends or some other random encounters, and with repeated interactions I would have those moments ‚Äî those moments when I see them shine, when I see them in their most tender form, and felt myself fell for them. These were moments in contexts that I would have never really achieve with ease through someone I have met online. It‚Äôs through classrooms discussions, through hanging out in a big group, through the random moments when their presence become more than just a friend. In truth, those people I developed feelings for, I‚Äôd unlikely even match with them on dating apps. Because those prospects that matter most on the online platforms: physical appearance, weird one-liners about your personality, all of them rarely matter when I see the whole picture of the person.
And maybe it is my fault that I feel like I‚Äôm walking to my personal guillotine each time I go on a date; I can‚Äôt seem to stop dreading the conversations, and my own inability to be genuine. It‚Äôs difficult to not try to please the person on the other end. After all, I know I am being assessed in that space, for how suitable I may be as a romantic partner to them. So around when do I let them know all the details that may be important to them but not something I‚Äôm comfortable sharing right away ‚Äî like the fact that I‚Äôm pansexual, still trying to come out to my parents, but hey don‚Äôt worry, that‚Äôs more of a just so you know fact, because it doesn‚Äôt matter when I am with you and committed to you?
Or the odd feeling of juggling going few dates a week, having to lie when you schedule the next one because all your friends recommend you to ‚Äúkeep your options open‚Äù. Even though I know the other party is probably doing the same, the guilt of dishonesty still catches on to me.
The feeling of knowing you‚Äôre easily replaceable and so is the person in front of you, the feeling of a mechanical routine of swiping left and right, the feeling of a due time to reply to the person with the right message ‚Äî all these assembly line-esque nature of modern dating made me realize that at my core I am still a dumb romantic. That although I have always approached love with logic and sometimes efficiency, which often resulted in stunted romance, I still have difficulties with bringing myself to embrace the idea and act meeting a life partner through online dating.
I don‚Äôt for one second doubt the good that it can do and has bought to many people; when you approach it with a genuine heart open for new possibilities and an attitude of optimism, it is very possible that your one is the next swipe and date away. But for a realist near pessimist who has trouble developing affection easily and feeling genuine when I know I am being assessed every date I go on, taking a break from online dating is a necessity. And perhaps just the realization itself that online dating is not meant for everyone, not even if you‚Äôre a young millennial who grew up in the digital age, and you‚Äôre not that strange for not finding this approach to love to be odd ‚Äî is reassuring enough at the moment.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that on your wrist?‚Äù
‚ÄúThis?‚Äù I say, signaling to the Medic Alert bracelet as if there were any other options.
‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù
By that point, she almost always knows it‚Äôs a Medic Alert tag because the logo is so large. She wants to know what it‚Äôs for.
After I explain it, I often get a comparative reply.
‚ÄúMy cousin has one of those for diabetes.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy friend has one for nut allergies. Do you carry an EpiPen?‚Äù
‚ÄúMy grandpa has a necklace with a button in case he falls. Or is that Life Alert?‚Äù
Nobody‚Äôs ever heard of the reason I have mine: ‚ÄúAdrenal insufficiency. On steroids.‚Äù
Sometimes after I discuss my chronic illness, which stems from a tumor on my pituitary gland, my date will feel obligated to recount a medical saga, typically not a personal one.
‚ÄúMy AP Calc teacher from high school had a brain tumor, too. I think it was on his brain stem, so they couldn‚Äôt operate.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúHe died.‚Äù
Did I mention how much fun it is to date me?
Chronic illness has affected my dating life. For most of adulthood, I‚Äôve been single by choice.
‚ÄúThe choice of the women of America,‚Äù I once joked.
But seriously.
It can be hard for someone else to want to be around you when you don‚Äôt even want to be around yourself.
From 2004 to 2008, age twenty to twenty-four, I dealt with an agonizing chronic pain disorder. It started at the beginning of sophomore year in college and lasted until a year after graduation.
Between five to ten times a day and sometimes more, I was besieged by one- to two-minute headaches so severe that I couldn‚Äôt stand or keep my eyes open. Sometimes these attacks would arise out of nowhere and other times they would be triggered by a change in blood pressure: if I stood up too fast, if I turned my head quickly, or if I was startled by a loud noise.
The cause was the tumor at the base of my brain pressing against an important nerve called the trigeminal nerve, the largest of the nerves that connect to the brain. It controls some motor functions of the mouth and is tied to sensation of the face. It‚Äôs why I sometimes called these attacks ‚Äúface pains‚Äù because they began as a stabbing feeling in my left cheek before spreading to my forehead and temples.
After four years of searching for answers and treatment, a neurosurgeon showed me on an MRI right where the tumor was pushing against the nerve.
It took me four years to reach this diagnosis because my neuro-endocrinologist, a supposed expert in her field who was managing my pituitary tumor with medication therapy, declared in 2004 that the headaches had ‚Äúabsolutely nothing to do with the tumor.‚Äù
‚ÄúI have never had a patient with the same symptoms,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúso you should start seeing neurologists to figure it out.‚Äù
I accepted this expert‚Äôs opinion as fact.
I saw neurologists, a dozen of them. I saw ENTs, seizure specialists, psychiatrists, and MDs with holistic training who promoted ‚Äúalternative therapies.‚Äù (Note: ginseng is not a cure-all.) I tried at least twenty medications, mostly painkillers and anti-seizure drugs, and not a single one did anything to combat the pain. Many carried strong side effects.
Doctors told me, ‚ÄúYou probably shouldn‚Äôt drink alcohol.‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt during freshman year of college. Sophomore year, I began experimenting. A few sips of beer. Half of a mixed drink. A shot!
It wasn‚Äôt so bad. One or two drinks eased the terrible anxiety I had that painful forces within my body would attack at any second. I was still years away from figuring out the cause, so the fear was omnipresent.
Dating was a disaster.
I didn‚Äôt have the confidence to walk up to a woman and chat.
If she gasps in horror or yells at me or throws her drink in my face, I‚Äôll get a pain attack.
I stayed within my friend group and friends-of-friends, but the few times a woman showed genuine interest in me, I was still terrified.
Having an orgasm could (and did) trigger pain attacks.
Imagine fearing climax because the best feeling might be followed by the worst.
Self-doubt. Anxiety. Inadequacy.
I was in a committed relationship with each one.
Here‚Äôs a fun story that will ruin any infinitesimal chance there is of you being attracted to me!
Sometimes I lactate.
I‚Äôm a man, and sometimes a tiny drop of breastmilk will emerge from my nipple.
The kind of tumor I have is a prolactinoma, which secretes the hormone prolactin.
It‚Äôs the hormone that‚Äôs elevated in women after they‚Äôve given birth and is also linked with postpartum depression.
‚ÄúA depressive man who occasionally lactates,‚Äù you say, ‚ÄúWhere do I sign up?‚Äù
You can find me on dating websites under the screen name MilkMan84.
(Not really though.)
During college, I kept much of my illness a secret, including my pain attacks ‚Äî it was a full-time job that involved a lot of randomly running away and returning with tears in my eyes.
I had ‚Äúallergies‚Äù year-round.
As for my illness, friends knew I had a brain tumor and they saw me take pills on occasion, but I didn‚Äôt divulge details. The main reasons were denial and not wanting anyone to see me as weak.
One day, I decided to talk in depth about it with a friend. I mentioned the lactation.
The next day, I walked into the dining hall and a few of my friends started laughing.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said.
‚ÄúYou make milk with your tits?!‚Äù one friend said between guffaws (we‚Äôre not friends anymore, clearly).
I glared at the friend I told.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know it was a secret,‚Äù she said, turning crimson.
Relevant side note: a year later, I would urge this same friend to get an MRI after she told me about some strange symptoms she was experiencing. Turns out, she had the same exact type of tumor, except hers was the very small variety, a microprolactinoma.
Don‚Äôt call it punishment. She really didn‚Äôt know I hadn‚Äôt told anybody else about the lactation, and she‚Äôs also one of the kindest human beings I know.
We‚Äôre still friends, unlike the ‚Äòmilk tits‚Äô guy.
Wrapped up in chronic illness is often shame and embarrassment.
This is especially true when you‚Äôre a cisgender man whose chemical composition at times more closely resembles a cisgender woman.
These days, my prolactin and estrogen levels are lower than they‚Äôve ever been. I have a normal testosterone for a 34-year-old male.
But I know what it‚Äôs like to have a testosterone of near-zero.
I know what it‚Äôs like to go months without the desire to masturbate or have sex.
At times in my life, mostly high school and college, I marveled at the lengths men would go just for a chance sexual encounter.
Like driving three hours from Northern NJ to Cape May to meet a few ‚Äúgirls‚Äù they‚Äôd been chatting with online. This was 2002 before there was a verb, ‚Äúcatfish,‚Äù to describe what was being done to them.
Or taking the bus out of Boston to go to a party at an all-female liberal arts college.
And returning on the same bus after being categorically rejected to go to the last half-hour of the bars in Boston ‚Äî most close at 1 a.m. (Puritans!)
I couldn‚Äôt envision doing any of these things.
Once my pain attacks were resolved ‚Äî as in, cured (a miracle) ‚Äî by surgery a year after I graduated college in 2008, I began to emerge from my cocoon of nerves. I battled PTSD as I regained confidence.
In the summer of 2009, I went to Italy for a month, partly paid for by a job in travel video editing. I met a woman in Rome. We hung out for a few days, but nothing happened.
I was ecstatic. At least I felt the desire to be around women.
A few months later, I moved to LA, where I lived for five years. I didn‚Äôt start dipping my toe in the dating pool until 2011, but when I did, I encountered an unexpected obstacle.
Ableism.
There is no way I‚Äôm blaming all of my dating woes on ableism, not even close.
I‚Äôm neurotic. I talk too much when I‚Äôm nervous. I‚Äôm a hopeless romantic who falls in love too easily.
After going out with a woman for a month early on in my return to dating, I said what I thought at the time was a flattering kernel of truth, something the love interest of a romantic film might say to the protagonist as he touches her cheek in the moonlight.
‚ÄúThe most incredible thing about you is that you don‚Äôt know how beautiful you are.‚Äù
It‚Äôs bad, I know! I cringe thinking about it. It was around the time the One Direction song with similar lyrics came out, but I swear I‚Äôd never heard it.
I came up with that one all by my lonesome. I don‚Äôt know if that makes it better or worse.
Needless to say, I don‚Äôt always radiate confidence.
I also have qualities that are not traditionally masculine. I‚Äôm sensitive and emotional. I value honest communication, both talking and listening. I‚Äôm not aggressive, which I‚Äôve been called out for.
‚ÄúI kept asking myself when this idiot was going to kiss me,‚Äù a woman texted me after a fourth date. That idiot was me.
I do have good qualities. I‚Äôm able to express myself and what I‚Äôm feeling, rather than repressing it. I‚Äôm loyal and loving. I will go out of my way to make my partner happy. I get genuine fulfillment from giving pleasure. I‚Äôm a skilled chef and baker. I‚Äôm romantic, and I swear that I don‚Äôt drop One Direction lyrics as compliments anymore.
My finer qualities have fostered relationships. My foibles have hindered them.
Yet on multiple occasions, the mere concept of my illness has been a dealbreaker. Ironically, the manifestations and symptoms of my condition have never gotten in the way.
Simply being sick can be an insurmountable relationship obstacle.
The first time that illness proved to be an impediment was with the woman who didn‚Äôt know she was beautiful (oh oh, that‚Äôs what made her beautiful). I know, I couldn‚Äôt believe she still dated me after that either.
As we grew closer, I decided to tell her about my chronic illness.
I recall her body language, how she shifted in her chair and moved herself back from the table. She was silent as I explained. A long pause followed.
‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù I asked.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how to process that.‚Äù
We went out a few more times, each outing icier than the last until she stopped returning my texts.
Months later, I began regularly seeing someone, the first woman I developed strong feelings for. It wasn‚Äôt love, but it felt like the potential to be. I told her about my chronic illness, and she seemed okay with it. Mostly.
‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre going to be fine, right?‚Äù she said, along with other variations that basically asked, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre sick, but it‚Äôs not going to affect you or anything, right? Like I‚Äôll never notice it, right?‚Äù
I ignored the red flags within her questions. Everything seemed alright after that.
Then she flew home for a few weeks to visit family. I drove her to the airport and kissed her goodbye.
We had so much fun together. We connected. The chemistry was palpable, but after a few days at home, she stopped communicating. When we were both back in town, I got an email. Yep, an email.
‚ÄúTo be honest, and I‚Äôve come to this realization as of late, I could see myself dating you, but it wouldn‚Äôt lead to marriage.‚Äù
I told myself it had nothing to do with me being sick, that it was a coincidence she had just spent time with her father, a physician with a speciality who would have intimate knowledge of the short- and long-term effects of my condition.
I wanted to chalk it up to having a horrible personality ‚Äî because hey, I can work on that ‚Äî but the rest of her email was filled with exclamation-pointed assurances of what a great guy I was and how she enjoyed spending time with me.
Finally, she wrote, ‚ÄúI like you! We totally get along! We connect! I respect you! But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to go beyond that. I hope you understand.‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt, and I didn‚Äôt ask why. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would get the truth. I didn‚Äôt know if I wanted it either.
I replied with an email thanking her for ‚Äúproviding closure.‚Äù
I plodded my way through the next few years of dating, still spending most of the time single. I gained more confidence, but my health gradually got worse. The residual tumor after two surgeries and radiation was slowly growing again, and I was feeling the effects.
I moved back to New Jersey, in large part because of my health.
More specifically, I moved home. That in itself is often a dating dealbreaker, but it was the best move for me. I can work from home, and I also anticipated needing surgery again. Having a support system has been crucial to healing in the past.
I dated sporadically. Surprisingly, some have been okay with my temporary residence in my parents‚Äô basement, literally the clicheÃÅ of loserdom.
Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôll move out eventually. What‚Äôs not okay for many is that my chronic illness will never move out of me.
‚ÄúI was wondering when you were going to tell me all of that,‚Äù one woman said, not seeming thrilled when I finally explained my condition.
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I said, confused.
‚ÄúRachel already told me everything.‚Äù
Rachel was her best friend. Rachel‚Äôs mom was close friends with my mom. My mom long ago told Rachel‚Äôs mom about my illness, and then Rachel‚Äôs mom told Rachel, yada yada yada.
I didn‚Äôt know what to make of the fact that my date had possessed this knowledge as long as we‚Äôd been seeing each other and was waiting for me to disclose it, like someone who knows their partner is cheating but wants to see how long they keep up the lie.
The truth was that I didn‚Äôt see it as keeping a secret. It‚Äôs a part of my life, but it doesn‚Äôt define me. It‚Äôs also not information that I‚Äôm ever obligated to share.
I think she disagreed. We didn‚Äôt last long beyond that.
These days, I‚Äôm far less insecure about it. I made it a point to deal with two feelings that nagged me since diagnosis: anger and denial.
It‚Äôs taken a lot of work. I‚Äôm still not 100% there, but I‚Äôm proud of my progress, which has happened mostly in the last two years.
Do I opine that it took thirty-four years of life, sixteen since diagnosis, to gain some serious perspective?
Nope. I‚Äôm grateful to have gained perspective at all.
Also, viewing the world through a different lens, everything seems fresh with possibility.
I realized that by living through awful times, I can relate to and empathize with those who are stuck in them. Helping others has become a central part of my life. I know what it‚Äôs like to be hopeless, scraping the bottom of life, then seeing the silhouette of a hand reaching out. It‚Äôs an incredible feeling to squint my eyes and understand that hand is for me. I‚Äôve taken hold of a few helping hands in life, and I‚Äôm grateful for each one.
Even at times when I still hit the bottom, it‚Äôs healing to connect with those who are in the same place.
We all struggle, which can feel isolating, but sharing our experiences is a reminder that we‚Äôre not alone.
Does ableism still make me bristle? Of course.
Recently I went on a few excellent dates. We both acknowledged an instant connection. It felt like we were old friends, reconnecting with each other after a long while.
Perhaps it was because we started texting a month before we actually met up.
I had a good excuse for the delay: neurosurgery.
Just as I anticipated, I needed surgery again, and it was an overall success, removing 90‚Äì95% of the remaining tumor.
My date and I connected on an app a week before that. I decided to be honest, since I didn‚Äôt want to make it seem like I was avoiding her moving forward.
She was okay with it ‚Äî mostly.
Once she asked if I still wanted to go out. She was worried that I hadn‚Äôt been showing enough interest.
I texted back something like, ‚ÄúOf course I do. I‚Äôm just, y‚Äôknow, in the hospital right now recovering from surgery,‚Äù which she knew. I appreciated she was eager to get together.
When we did go out, it was great. I joked that we spent our first few dates talking about ‚Äúheavy shit,‚Äù which was interesting and refreshing. We had more intimate conversations than I‚Äôd ever experienced so early, so I figured maybe it was good that she knew about my health problems before we met.
It was good until it wasn‚Äôt.
I sensed some friction, and she called me last weekend, tipsy from a get-together with friends.
I heard a preface I was familiar with, about me being a wonderful guy who was caring, smart, and funny. I waited for the inevitable.
‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm just not totally attracted to you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou have this illness. That concerns me.‚Äù
The clearest articulation yet.
It stung in the moment, but in retrospect, I‚Äôm grateful for her honesty.
My illness concerns me. I deal with it daily. It concerned her in a different way, as in, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay with this part of you.‚Äù
I‚Äôm attracted to the entire person ‚Äî good qualities and bad, strengths and quirks, all the parts as one.
I consider myself empathetic, loving, and accepting. I‚Äôm looking for the same.
If you can‚Äôt accept my chronic illness, you can‚Äôt accept me. I‚Äôm better off finding out sooner rather than later.
It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt treat it like a secret anymore, something to be revealed on the third date when asked about my Medic Alert bracelet.
For better or worse, it‚Äôs part of who I am. That‚Äôs not going to change.
What has changed is the way I view it. I‚Äôm not ashamed. A simple reality like occasional lactation used to deeply embarrass me, mostly because we‚Äôre programmed to view gender in a certain way and I worried that it made me less of a man.
It doesn‚Äôt, no more than my illness makes me less of a human.
I‚Äôve learned that if I shut myself off and keep parts of me secret, I lose out on the best part of being human: connection.
I live for connection, whether it‚Äôs the love I feel towards family and close friends, or the sensation that comes when reading someone else‚Äôs perspective and relating. It‚Äôs a reminder that we share universal experiences ‚Äî that even though being human can feel unbearably lonely, we have far more commonalities than differences.
When we hear constant narratives of how divided we are, it can be healing to experience the connection of shared humanity. It has certainly been healing and enlightening for me to read writers who speak their truths.
It‚Äôs why I write. The connections I‚Äôve made with people who have related and responded to my words have changed my life for the better.
I‚Äôm still looking for the as-yet elusive connection of romantic love.
I remain hopeful.
Loving someone for everything they are and having that love reciprocated, that‚Äôs the meaningful connection I‚Äôm after.
Writer. Reader. Wonderer.

Kris Gage|45K|4|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-to-really-know-youre-in-love-d8d433a0f0bf?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|How to *really* know you‚Äôre in love ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Because most of ‚Äúthe signs‚Äù they tell you are garbage
Because it‚Äôs mostly shit advice.
Here‚Äôs a small sampling:
This is infatuation.
If someone‚Äôs ‚Äúalways‚Äù on your mind, you‚Äôre not focused on other Really Important Things. And that‚Äôs a problem.
Real love fits into real life, rather than usurping it. It‚Äôs calm, not overwhelming.
See above.
Ditto.
Well, I mean, damn. You fantasize long and hard enough, you can see anything in your future ‚Äî like I could imagine moving to Switzerland to be a goat farmer. That doesn‚Äôt mean I should.
The problem is that we‚Äôve made ‚Äúlove‚Äù into a game of escapism, and measure potential partners by how they fit into that fantasy. That‚Äôs not love.
So, sure, see them in your future ‚Äî but not because they ‚Äúcomplete the picture.‚Äù
See above.
Ha. Hahaha. Clearly you have never been in a (healthy) long-term relationship.
You should usually want to see bae. But love isn‚Äôt always wanting to. Sometimes you need a minute. Sometimes you need to work or do other things. Or, damn, just be.
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs not love just because sometimes you want space.
Well. That‚Äôs scary.
Y u tryin so hard? Loving isn‚Äôt ‚Äúimpressing.‚Äù
Healthy love doesn‚Äôt involve fear of loss. That‚Äôs attachment.
It also doesn‚Äôt involve fear of ‚Äúnever being with another woman.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know what that is. Low self esteem? Lack of conviction?
This is attachment again, not mature love.
This is self-love, not love. (Also: you‚Äôre an idiot.)
Well. Glad you‚Äôre getting your emotional needs met.
But this just means that they are deserving of love. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you are loving them.
Well. Thanks for the most unhelpful advice ever.
To everyone who‚Äôs ever said this: y tho? pls stahp.
Don‚Äôt perpetuate nonsense and call it ‚Äúromance‚Äù just because you don‚Äôt have suitable answers.
The difference here is probably what the rest of your day looks like.
Good: If you‚Äôre happy with your life and your partner adds to it, then congrats. You win.
Bad: If you‚Äôre unhappy and using your partner as an oasis, then you need to get your shit together.
Good: you actually care about their wants and needs, and prioritize them in a way that doesn‚Äôt tear you down
Bad: you compromise your own wants and needs, or base your value on your ability to ‚Äúkeep them happy.‚Äù
Rad for them
Congrats, there may be hope for you yet.
Great. I want happiness for most people.
You found someone with whom you‚Äôre comfortable, and whose company you enjoy. Good on you.
Role models have that effect on us, too. That doesn‚Äôt mean we love them.
You don‚Äôt feel love. You DO it. It‚Äôs an act, not a feeling. It‚Äôs a moment by moment decision and re-commitment. You know because it‚Äôs deliberate and conscious.
You invest. You exert effort.
You don‚Äôt knowingly do harm. You aren‚Äôt vengeful, petty, manipulative, or jealous. Their needs never seem irritating. You aren‚Äôt grabby with them, their time, or their affection in return. You are secure without demanding constant reassurance.
You prioritize their viewpoints. You learn their love language. You think in terms of their interests, not yours, and their needs are your own. You support them. You back them. You care and take care. You accept, and you allow.
Because everyone thinks they‚Äôre in love when it‚Äôs clear skies and calm waters, but watch them when the storm hits.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre pissed. It‚Äôs love if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúfight;‚Äù you disagree.
You love if your objective is reaching an agreement, not picking a winner.
You love if you don‚Äôt get defensive, insecure, or manipulative. If you don‚Äôt keep score. If you don‚Äôt hold grudges. If you don‚Äôt ‚Äútake back your love‚Äù as punishment.
You love if you seek to understand before being understood; listen and honor what they share ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt double down with your own issues. If you act like you‚Äôre on the same team. You listen. You compromise. You apologize. You forgive.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre hurt. Especially honoring and respecting their wants and needs even when they include ‚Äúbreaking up.‚Äù
We like to differentiate between ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù and ‚Äúloving‚Äù someone. But ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù is infatuation, and infatuation means nothing in getting real love.
So if what you want is real love, then ‚Äúhow to‚Äù is all that matters.
You ‚Äúknow‚Äù because you decide. It‚Äôs love when you do it. All the time.

Kris Gage|24K|7|https://medium.com/@krisgage/signs-they-love-you-b13e65419e8c?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|Signs They Love You ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Most of the things that are listed in these sorts of articles are not love. They are attachment, or infatuation, or flirtation ‚Äî or something just being nice.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it looks across a series of emotions, lukewarm to love.
Here‚Äôs normal stuff that normal people do ‚Äî and should do ‚Äî even with strangers. It doesn‚Äôt even mean they necessarily like you as a person ‚Äî they might just be polite. Especially in the south.
None of these are signs of someone liking you. This is just normal human being stuff, guys.
Congrats, they socialize well and you probably do too.
Again, these aren‚Äôt love. Tiffany Sun just wrote a great post on this ‚Äî ‚Äúthings I wish guys didn‚Äôt take as a mixed signal.‚Äù
But don‚Äôt necessarily love you.
And not only not you, but often in a way that‚Äôs harmful to you, not genuine self-care.
i.e., things people do ‚Äúfor others‚Äù that are really for them.
i.e., a prerequisite to being able to love someone else.
Regardless of any of the above.
Way too many people worry about being ‚Äúfriend-zoned.‚Äù This is a misplaced concern. It‚Äôs a lot easier to transition a friendship into romance than to wring romantic feelings out of not even liking each other as people.
The bigger concern ‚Äî and what‚Äôs really happening for a lot of frustrated daters ‚Äî is that they barely even like you as a person.
They don‚Äôt care about your goals, your values, your fears, or your love language.
The big one is if they have a checklist of qualities they wanted in a partner and you happen to hit them. Or they have a list of stuff they‚Äôve always wanted to do with ‚Äúsomeone,‚Äù and now you‚Äôre working your way through it together. When asked what they like about you, they list different things than how you value yourself (especially if the first one is superficial, like looks.)
They adapted very little to ‚Äúaccommodate‚Äù you into their lives, and if you disappeared tomorrow, they‚Äôd just go on living exactly the same way they always have.
They make you laugh only because they get off on ‚Äúbeing funny.‚Äù They invite you on their trip because they just really want someone to travel with. They share books and music and film and restaurant suggestions because they just get off on sharing or being in the know ‚Äî or they need for you to like the same things ‚Äî not because they care about your opinion. Or they do nice gestures just because they have a deep need to feel ‚Äúappreciated‚Äù and influence over your happiness.
Somehow nothing is ever for them to own ‚Äî and they don‚Äôt want to. Their primary reaction is always to defend themselves, and they‚Äôre never to blame.
I don‚Äôt mean the occasional drifting. I mean a general, persistent feeling of ‚Äúawayness.‚Äù
One day they‚Äôre whispering sweet nothings in your ear, and then they go missing for two weeks.
Like ‚Äúbeautiful.‚Äù
They still make long-term plans without discussing it with you. They still propose weekend plans by saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs where I‚Äôll be if you wanna come.‚Äù
Their ask about your day in a way that‚Äôs half-hearted. They barely care about your struggles, and rarely share your celebrations.
They care about you and your wellbeing separate from themselves and their own.
Nobody can love without self-love. People without self-love will be seemingly ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù and ‚Äúself-less‚Äù but are actually using generosity to mask their deep-seated insecurity and need to build their self esteem around others emotional dependence on them.
They love you if they never check in on you loving them back. They love you if the energy is truly give, not give and ‚Äúnow-where‚Äôs-my-love-or-appreciation-back‚Äù take.
Without strings attached. When they‚Äôre invested in deeply understanding you. And they go out of their way to make you happy.
They rearrange their lives to fit you in.
People love themselves and their own lives, so if they start forgoing any of that to be with you, that‚Äôs a good sign.
It doesn‚Äôt have to be all their free time. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be every day. And it certainly doesn‚Äôt have to be as much as you want, if your idea of ‚Äúenough time‚Äù is higher than theirs. But they do prioritize you.
When you‚Äôre together, you‚Äôre together. They aren‚Äôt zoning out or interrupting while you‚Äôre talking, or eager for a distraction. Their mind is on the moment.
They use words. It may not be the three words you want most to hear, but there will be communication.
They‚Äôre supportive of whatever is most important to you.
Especially their future plans.
Your pain is their pain. Your happiness is their happiness. Your day is their day. Your aspirations are theirs, too.
Theirs as well as your own.

Don‚Äôt talk to me about peaks. Don‚Äôt talk to anybody about peaks ‚Äî not your partner, not your BFF, and especially not yourself.
Everyone experiences the elation of emotional peaks with their partners, and everybody wants to call these feelings ‚Äúlove,‚Äù especially early on. But these are fools gold, and even if you think ‚Äúthis one‚Äôs different, man,‚Äù I‚Äôll tell you again:love is never in the upside.
It‚Äôs in the valleys. And that‚Äôs where you know for sure.
What‚Äôs your gut reaction when things go south? What‚Äôs your lizard brain say when shit hits the fan? I‚Äôm not saying that you should listen to it ‚Äî lizard brains are notoriously stupid, and often need to be shushed and guided by more mature and developed thinking ‚Äî but I am saying you should notice.Because love is neither fight nor flight; love doubles-down, joins forces, makes it work. If your reaction is to throw punches or throw in the towel, it‚Äôs not love.
Look, just don‚Äôt talk about love in terms of feelings ‚Äî and this definitely includes ‚Äúinfatuation‚Äù or ‚Äúpreoccupation‚Äù or ‚Äúobsession‚Äù or ‚Äúcan‚Äôt live without‚Äù (see above.)
Talk about feelings all you want ‚Äî they are incredibly wonderful parts of the human experience ‚Äî and feel All Of The Feelings for your partner, because those are some of the juiciest. Just also understand that love is a choice, an active decision, and a series of investments and efforts and actions. Theproblem with defining love as ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù is twofold: 1.) it makes for immature relationships, and 2.) leaves us susceptible to one day ‚Äúnot feeling it‚Äù and folding.
Not just for a moment (because that happens to all of us) and also not as the result of depression (look into that to make sure), but rather a pervasivefeeling of not actually connecting.
This is different than feelings ‚Äúfading,‚Äù as mentioned above. You can still care deeply for someone but feel lonely every time you‚Äôre together. If you don‚Äôt actually connect, it will never be the making of a rich relationship.
I dated one dude for a while, when we were young and dumb and didn‚Äôt know what we didn‚Äôt know, and we thought this was well enough how love was supposed to look. But I can pinpoint the exact moment I realized we should break up. We were at the mall, killing time on another empty afternoon, not even walking around or actually shopping but just standing there, leaning on a railing and looking down at a lower level. And all of a sudden I was overcome with this immense loneliness ‚Äî not in the moment, but rather the sudden and undeniable realization that I was always lonely with him. We were never truly together; never really seeing each other eye to eye; instead just rushing around to distract ourselves from it. And once we stopped and stared at nothing long enough for me to see it, I couldn‚Äôt go back to unseeing.
Honestly, I either have no idea what ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù means or I just bundle it into other things (like ‚Äúintellectual companions,‚Äù and ‚Äúfriendship,‚Äù and ‚Äúconversation,‚Äù see below.)
But I guess it‚Äôs worth including because so many people do: if you continually come back to ‚Äúthe way your partner looks on paper‚Äù to defend the relationship to yourself, it‚Äôs probably going south.
This, as I said, is probably just my ‚Äúchemistry,‚Äù but either way it is, in my mind, a very important, stand-alone thing.
I dated a dude for five years who was plenty ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and successful in his own right, but he and I fundamentally operated in very different ways. I never felt as though I had an intellectual companion, and I spent years thinking, ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs fine ‚Äî we all make sacrifices in love. There is no perfect partner.‚Äù
But there‚Äôs a difference between rooting for different sports teams and being able to have the conversations you care most about. When I shared my most cherished thoughts or abstract questions ‚Äî like ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it interesting how people choose to build their lives?‚Äù ‚Äî looking to volley answers or even (dream big!) build a full-blown discussion, he would absentmindedly quell it with, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way things are ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt mean anything.‚Äù Full stop.
When it comes to a ‚Äúlife partner,‚Äù make sure they‚Äôre actually there for the ‚Äúlife stuff.‚Äù
Like if you share big news with your partner (you got promoted, won a deal, quit that job you hated, whatever) they shouldn‚Äôt sound as though you just said you grabbed milk on the way home.
Ditto for death.
They should hug you if you‚Äôre crying, offer to go to the services (and actually go, if you want them to and they can), and refrain from making jokes too soon or demanding brownie points if they order flowers. This is easy stuff, guys. Yet it‚Äôs amazing how many people eff this up.
After my brother died unexpectedly (and then a job offer fell through only after I‚Äôd quit my previous position), I came down with the worst cold (or flu) of my life ‚Äî the kind where your nose simply won‚Äôt stop running and you can‚Äôt manage basic functions and you‚Äôre so physically fatigued you can‚Äôt even go to the grocery to get drugs for it. My boyfriend and I lived together at the time, but he was so oblivious that after a day and a half I dragged myself, zombie-like, to the drug store two blocks away and bought my own meds, and was so exhausted by the time I got back that I crashed on the couch for hours afterwards.
For anybody who‚Äôs sitting there thinking, ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you just ask him?‚Äù Iseriously encourage you to reevaluate your standards of basic human decency and awareness. Normally ‚Äúasking‚Äù is correct. But damn, son.
With the biggest catalyst being ‚Äúmoving.‚Äù
When they move across the country (or the world) and you are in no way inclined to follow (except, perhaps, ‚Äúfor the adventure.‚Äù) Or, vice versa, when you feel compelled to move across the country but only half-care if they come.
If you think you love someone because they‚Äôre ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù or ‚Äúgiving‚Äù or ‚Äúmake you feel good‚Äù or some other self-serving pleasure, then you should realize: that‚Äôs not real love.
That‚Äôs not to say you don‚Äôt (or can‚Äôt) really love them, but ‚Äúthe pleasure they give you‚Äù (or, in codependent cases, the pleasure you give them) can never be the foundation.
Just go re-read the first section, honestly.
Mature love is based on healthy non-attachment
I don‚Äôt understand how anybody could ever think it‚Äôs ‚Äúromantic‚Äù for someone to declare, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to marry you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have kids with you‚Äù shortly after meeting them.
Gross. Get out of here with that grabby shit.
One dude I dated said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make you my wife‚Äù within a couple months of knowing me, and my knee jerk reaction was: ‚Äúwow ‚Äî does he not realize I have a say in this?‚Äù
The most interesting part was: I had come home from our first date feeling the same way. But the fact that he said it so matter of factly, without me ever verbally weighing in on the matter, turned me off so much it couldn‚Äôt be salvaged. It wasn‚Äôt cute and it wasn‚Äôt romantic ‚Äî even though our feelings had once aligned, because I realized that that fact didn‚Äôt actually matter to him.
It was presumptuous and off-putting and poor form. If you find this romantic, you really need to check your idea of personal agency and emotionalboundaries.
And that realization is, on the one hand, weird ‚Äî because I make decisions like this all the time with my partners (love is, after all, choice and commitment) so I‚Äôm not sure where the line is in whether ‚Äúdeciding‚Äù is love or ownership. Maybe it has to do with actually knowing the other person (as discerned by them, not you.) Either way, all I know is that when it aligns in the right way, it feels really good. And when it doesn‚Äôt, and they claim more of you than you offered or chose, it‚Äôs heart-wrenching. And it‚Äôs only worse if youdid choose or offer, only differently or less, because they don‚Äôt care and your left standing there with your heart in your hand.
Fear and love can‚Äôt coexist. If your primary anxiety around the idea of breaking up is ‚Äúfear of being alone,‚Äù it isn‚Äôt love.
Embracing each other as individual human beings with individual human being lives, who just happen to get along enough to bump down the road alongside one another.
Then, mutual investment and support in each other‚Äôs growth, especially when things get rough or scary. But always complementary, never to complete one another. And always with care and compassion.

Kris Gage|10.1K|7|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-much-to-give-and-take-in-relationships-ccbdf31e2f4e?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|How Much To Give And Take In Relationships ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"I always have a big question in my head, and it‚Äôs always about love ‚Äî and life.
After I broke up with my boyfriend of five years in 2014, my question was around ‚Äúpersonal agency‚Äù and ‚Äúreal love‚Äù ‚Äî specifically, whether someone can really love us if they see us differently (lesser and more superficially) than we see ourselves; if there is no ‚Äútrue‚Äù reality, then which version of ‚Äúus‚Äù is real? Do we get final say in who we are and how we want to be seen (and loved?) (Side note: after 3 years and countless books, Emma Lindsay‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúFish Love‚Äù is the closest and best answer I found.)
Last year, it was around emotional abuse ‚Äî and what constitutes it ‚Äî which lead to healthy vs. toxic love. (bell hooks had the best answers here.)
And that evolved into my big question this year, which is around ‚Äúemotional boundaries.‚Äù
If you don‚Äôt agree, it‚Äôs almost certainly because you don‚Äôt (yet) realize you struggle with them. Because pretty much the only people with healthy emotional boundaries are the ones who have conscientiously and deliberately put in the emotion work to build them.
We don‚Äôt learn them from our family. (In fact, if anything, we learn the opposite from our families, most of whom are either too invasive, too dependent, or too enabling and end up encouraging our dependency on them.)
We can‚Äôt learn them from media, which is so ill with bad relationship and love models it should all be regarded as satire at best.
And we don‚Äôt learn them from others, because everyone struggles with them (see above) and some even see ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù as being ‚Äúclosed off.‚Äù These people have a lot of emotion work to do, and should get their hands on some codependence reading.
This leaves the internet and books, but most of the advice there is equally bad.
A lot of relationship books don‚Äôt even address the concept of emotional boundaries (or emotional health) ‚Äî or worse, they actively encourage people to develop unhealthy ones, which sets everyone up for suffering.
Even books on boundaries beat around the bush, instead covering ‚Äúhow important they are‚Äù (great; duh) or ‚Äúhow to stand up for yourself‚Äù and ‚Äúsay no.‚Äù But those aren‚Äôt the real issue we have, evidenced by the fact that most of us sway erratically from one end of the spectrum to the other in attempt to find balance. We first find ourselves feeling ‚Äúwalked on‚Äù and then pick a fight over stupid shit to get even.
So far most books fail to address the real issue in emotional boundaries:
We all understand the logistics of how to not eat a cookie. (You say ‚Äúno thank you,‚Äù you don‚Äôt pick it up, you don‚Äôt take a bite. Done.) That‚Äôs not the hard part.
The hard part is discerning whether or not we really want to eat the cookie.
If we don‚Äôt eat the cookie, are we avoiding it from a position of peace, or self-punishment ‚Äî or pride? If we eat the cookie, is it with pleasure or lack of self-love? Do we actually want it? Will we regret it tomorrow? Do we want it because we‚Äôre bored, or we‚Äôve had a beer, or a stressful day, or our host is extending it to us on a plate and smiling at us with those eyes that plead, ‚Äúplease ‚Äî I spent an hour baking these.‚Äù Are any of those real desires? Should any of those be regarded as real desires? Is a cookie ever an appropriate vehicle for satisfying them? Is it ever appropriate to just say ‚Äúah, fuck it‚Äù and eat the cookie without identifying our real, underlying needs?
This is the hard part with boundaries ‚Äî understanding what we truly want, beneath the surface, and what‚Äôs healthy.
And a simple, innocent cookie bears like 1/1000th the weight of a person.
And if you think I‚Äôm maybe overthinking the cookie thing, I‚Äôll remind you: the cookie was a metaphor, bud. For boundaries. And if anything, we‚Äôre under-thinking those.
Before anybody gets pissy over that, let me clarify: you are entitled to feel your feelings. But that doesn‚Äôt mean your feelings are always reasonable or anybody else‚Äôs problem. And without emotion work, they can‚Äôt define emotional boundaries.
Resources on emotional boundaries often advise the reader to simply ‚Äúunderstand what upsets, hurts, or offends‚Äù us. One article said, ‚ÄúWhen you feel anger or resentment or find yourself whining or complaining, you probably need to set a boundary. Listen to yourself, determine what you need to do or say, then communicate assertively.‚Äù
What horrible advice.
I mean, maybe, sometimes that‚Äôs valid. But maybe (most times) you need to deal with your own emotions before putting them back on others. Maybe your reason for feeling anger or resentment or jealousy or insecurity is your own problem.
If everyone followed bad advice like the above, we‚Äôd all be running around with the emotional development of children, believing every whimper that crossed our tiny brains had to be validated and honored.
Guys, no. Part of being an adult (and developing emotional boundaries) is also about being able to discern which emotions are yours alone to deal with, and not project on others.
Sometimes people struggle to stand up for their feelings. Sometimes people struggle to understand the world isn‚Äôt responsible for soothing everything they feel. Most people struggle with discerning the difference, and bounce back and forth between the two.
So: the question here is on emotion work, really. How to manage our own emotions, and being able to appropriately discern what‚Äôs ours to fix (hint: most of it), and what‚Äôs valid / for other people.
Often these resources brush people off with advice like: ‚Äúknow your boundary and then say no.‚Äù And to that shit I‚Äôm like, thanks Barbara.
The problem is we‚Äôre all so bad at it, so we don‚Äôt have the privilege of trusting our own judgment yet. So who decides? Or, better yet: how do we know when we can? What if we don‚Äôt care? Should we?
I grab fries off my partner‚Äôs plate and borrow his clothes all the time without asking. I moved across the country for him. I listen when he jumps straight to ‚Äúproblem solving‚Äù when I share something.
Are those poor boundaries?? Even if neither of us cares, should we? Hell, even if we think we‚Äôre happy, should we be?
We are subconsciously socialized to empathize with other people‚Äôs feelings, but then we‚Äôre told not to take on other people‚Äôs feelings.
We‚Äôre told to ‚Äústand up for ourselves‚Äù but also ‚Äúsurrender to love.‚Äù We‚Äôre told to ‚Äúsay no‚Äù but never ‚Äúshut down.‚Äù
We‚Äôre warned against becoming ‚Äúemotionally exhausted‚Äù after talking to others, but we‚Äôre also warned against ‚Äúwithdrawing‚Äù or ‚Äúwalling others out.‚Äù
We‚Äôre told ‚Äúthe opposite of love is not ‚Äòhate‚Äô but ‚Äòapathy‚Äô‚Äù (or maybe ‚Äúfear?‚Äù), which means loving is caring ‚Äî but what‚Äôs too much?
We‚Äôre not supposed to sacrifice our dreams for relationships, but most dreams are fantasies anyway. (Would you reeaally move to a cabin in Vermont??)
When it comes to others‚Äô emotions, it makes sense: be open to others but don‚Äôt take on their emotions as your own. Fine. It‚Äôs not actually as clear it sounds, in practice, but it‚Äôs fine enough on paper. (Eat the cookie without becoming it. Eat the cookie without needing to identify as ‚Äúcookie eater.‚Äù Fine.)
But what about our own emotions, thoughts, preferences, ideas? And how should those two come together? How do we make this all work? How do we discern and compromise?
Like: it‚Äôs always bad when people try to change their partners. Except it‚Äôs not always bad, because there are caveats like: if their habit is objectively bad, like smoking. But what if it‚Äôs subjectively bad, or just sort of bad? Who gets to decide? Do they compromise? Should both have to give 50% if the habit is only regarding one person‚Äôs body or life? How much agency do we have over one another? And how does their agency affect our own?
It all comes down to better understanding of ‚Äî and responsibility for ‚Äî our own feelings and thoughts and what we truly want most, and expecting the same of people in our life.

Kathryn Holiday|449|4|https://psiloveyou.xyz/shit-testing-53caff47c62d?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|Shit Testing ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"There is not a woman in existence who doesn‚Äôt shit test. It‚Äôs part of our make up. We are rarely aware, in the midst of a shit test, that we are doing it. It‚Äôs organic. I believe this comes from a woman‚Äôs deep need for security. Due to our natural and biological vulnerabilities we seek protection and security. Shit tests come out of this chronic insecurity. They serve a purpose for us as we use them to ‚Äútest the waters‚Äù to make sure that what existed before still exists. More secure women will test their reality, the solidity of the walls, the availability of resources, the protection and comfort of her man less frequently than a more insecure woman. An insecure woman might test constantly. But all women will test. It will never end. It‚Äôs best to learn how to deal with it instead of fighting it or fighting with the women you love over it.
Sometimes, if we are self-aware and open to thinking critically about ourselves and our actions we can recognize that the fight we picked or the probing question we asked served no purpose at all except as a shit test.
I shit test, sometimes intentionally, but mostly as a reaction or to fill an emotional need that I don‚Äôt quite understand yet. Shit tests are always meant to provoke a response in a man but the source of the problem is always an inner conflict that I haven‚Äôt acknowledged yet. Yeah, life is unfair.
Very often, women do not know what we are feeling in the moment. Our emotions can be intense and even conflicting. Especially now that we have a culture that tries to tell us we are certain ways or are supposed to reject certain things, we feel inadequate or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù when we feel something different. That creates an inner conflict between what we are experiencing and what we think we should be experiencing. That conflict creates a sense of instability as well as a layer of doubt, fear and shame that we are not what we are ‚Äúsupposed to be.‚Äù
Many of these feelings are buried and they come out in surprising, often unproductive ways. One of these ways is the shit test in part because we‚Äôve been told that the origin of our suffering is men (a newer phenomenon) and also because we look to the men in our lives to resolve our problems, even our emotional problems (likely a tendency since the beginning of time).
So, when we are attached to a man we admire or need, we see him as both the cause and solution to our problems. But our problems are not tangible. Our biggest problem is our internal conflict of wanting to feel safe and secure but being biologically insecure on some level.
The shit test is an emotional outburst to gauge if our problem is caused by or can be resolved by the man. However, the shit test is not the problem. It is a symptom of the problem. And like the symptoms of a disease, you can treat the symptoms for temporary relief but if you never address the underlying cause, you will eventually die. Further, fixing the shit test is a red herring; it is a trap. If you respond to the shit test in any way, if you attempt to answer or repair the shit test in any way, you have failed. Because the shit test is a trap to say, ‚ÄúCan I count on you?‚Äù
A woman‚Äôs insecurity and a man‚Äôs ability to tend to it appropriately is the foundation of a relationship‚Äôs success. If you get a woman with a stronger foundation, you will have less work, but there is no foundation that doesn‚Äôt require any maintenance at all. All foundations require reinforcement.
The only appropriate response to a shit test is to dismiss it. You can not take the question seriously. You should not taking responsibility in any way (the cause or the solution) for her inner conflict.
When you ‚Äúanswer‚Äù her shit test, you are acknowledging that there is a crack in the foundation. If you acknowledge the crack then you are liable to be responsible for it. You will be blamed for causing it and you will be made responsible for repairing it.
‚ÄúDo I look fat?‚Äù Classic shit test. A no answer opens possibility that you are lying. If she feels fat enough to ask then your answer is contradicting her feeling. And if your ‚Äúno‚Äù is not convincing enough to obliterate her feeling, she will be angry at you for lying.
A yes answer won‚Äôt help either.
The only way to respond to a shit test is to dismiss it or make a joke as if it‚Äôs ridiculous, but not to answer it either way. Teasing is always effective. Followed by escalating sexually to get her turned on. This also shows her the attention and confirmation of affection she is likely seeking more than an answer.
It is truly not the man‚Äôs problem that she has these inner conflicts. They are a result of our biology clashing with culture, the misinformation spread to women and it is foremost a result of our personal hormonal cocktail.
The solution, of course, is for her to understand her body chemistry better, her moods, her feelings and take personal responsibility for handling them. But even still, our emotions sometimes are several leaps ahead of our minds. So, understanding each other helps a lot too.
Women need to reject the current cultural teachings that tell us that men are the cause of all our problems, that tell us to reject our femininity and suppress our quirks. We must reject the notion that we are supposed to be always strong, steady and in control (aka masculine). In the meantime, helping men understand these shit tests, good ways to respond to them, maybe a little sympathy/empathy for her inner conflicts, is the best we can do.

Bonnie Barton|11.9K|7|https://psiloveyou.xyz/i-called-out-a-guy-who-wanted-to-use-me-cd9463b6b041?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|I Called Out a Guy Who Wanted to Use Me ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"I read two stories over the weekend that collided in my brain.
(Shani Silver‚Äôs ‚Äú5 Bullsh*t Dating Practices That Have Jumped the Shark‚Äù and Jessica Wildfire‚Äôs ‚ÄúGuys, stop sending pictures of your junk.‚Äù)
They intersect with my most recent crash-and-burn interaction with another online dating dude.
I met him online a few weeks ago. He quickly provided the link to his professional website. He sent a short video of himself and his dog.
He communicated easily and checked in with me. I appreciated his effort to share small snippets of his life.
I liked his transparency. This felt more ‚Äúreal‚Äù than many of the interactions I have with men who I meet online.
By showing who he was and texting to ask about me, it felt like he was attempting to forge an authentic connection.
(I‚Äôve done this long enough to know that ANYTHING can happen. But it was an encouraging start.)
Eventually we got a little flirty. I took this opportunity to throw in some comments that would indicate I was not into any sort of dick pic, S&M/fetish relationship, or a casual sexual interaction.
We specifically discussed that men tend to be more visual while women are less so. He confirmed that he was very visual. I explicitly told him that I need to know someone better before I would ever want a suggestive photo of him.
I even acknowledged that no one had ever sent me a dick pic and I had no intention of soliciting one!
Fast forward an hour or two and he began asking for a photo of me. I responded that I hate selfies (true) and I wasn‚Äôt sure what I had on my phone.
Dude: It doesn‚Äôt have to be of your face.
Me (dawning realization of what he was really asking for)
A few moments later I realized that I had no desire to give this stranger a photo of myself.
Me: ‚ÄúActually, you can just look at the photos on my profile.‚Äù (I had about 10 posted on my profile.)
Dude: ‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù
He then asked if I wanted a photo of him. I told him that I did not. It was too soon. (We had not talked on the phone or met in person. We had only been texting for a day or two.)
Within a few minutes, he sent me a picture of himself in bed (presumably naked) cropped to just shy of his genitals.
I. was. pissed!
I had SUCH a strong reaction. Which caught me off guard.
I immediately deleted the photo and reamed him out.
I told him that I had deleted the photo. That I didn‚Äôt appreciate him sending me a photo of him in that position when I had already told him unequivocally that I had no interest in a risque photo of him.
I told him that I did not feel like he was listening to me. And that I didn‚Äôt like that AT ALL!
To his credit, he apologized immediately.
Bonnie from 4 years ago would have frozen and panicked. I probably would have just immediately blocked him.
I might have blamed myself somehow.
Bonnie of today doesn‚Äôt take that crap!
This guy‚Äôs behavior was boorish and misguided, but perhaps no one had ever called him out for it. (And, of course, technically it was not a dick pic.)
Or even more likely, I suspect a certain percentage of women have reciprocated with a similar photo. Which is fine. But it muddies the waters for guys. Well, for all of us.
It was a little scary to be so direct with a complete stranger. It occurred to me that he would most likely respond by getting angry or defensive with me. Or ghosting me entirely.
He was cute, smart, had a good job, I enjoyed texting him, and he seemed interesting. But I was going to call him out anyway and risk blowing this thing before I had even met him.
Nonetheless, I stuck to my guns.
And it felt good.
I accepted his apology and we did go out a couple of times.
It ended abruptly when he made it clear he wanted to sow oats with me and other women. I was fine with dating him, but told him that I would not be having a sexual relationship while he was sleeping with other women.
He said he wasn‚Äôt willing to wait.
I simply stated: ‚ÄúFair enough. Thank you for being honest. We are at an impasse.‚Äù
I assumed I would not hear from again.
He surprised me a few hours later by texting me about my night. Then he asked if he could stay over sometime. I was flabbergasted. I ended up calling him and reassuring him that I was not playing some sort of game.
There was nothing he could say or do that would change my mind regarding this matter.
As for him, I had told him what type of relationship I was comfortable with and he had declined. I had no intention of engaging in an argument with a grown adult. He had clearly communicated that he was unwilling to wait for a sexual relationship with me. I took him at his word.
I did, however, take the opportunity on the phone to point out what he was offering me: To ‚Äúdate‚Äù me. Under his scenario that meant that he could sleep with someone the prior night, then sleep with me, then sleep with someone else the next night.
I stated again that that offer was unappealing to me.
He simply muttered that ‚Äúit wouldn‚Äôt really be like that.‚Äù I countered: ‚ÄúOh,no. That is EXACTLY what you are asking of me.‚Äù
I was not going to let him try to spin this.
He said he was a friendly guy. That he liked our chemistry and our banter. That I was mature and interesting. That he wanted to see me again.
Me (very calmly and directly, not bitchy): ‚ÄúYeah, I think I‚Äôm going to pass. Usually I can stay in touch or be friends, but I don‚Äôt think I need to with you.‚Äù
We knew there was nowhere for this conversation to go, so we politely parted ways.
Even after all these years, it‚Äôs not easy for me to be treated like this. It hurts me. I can tolerate it better than I used to, but it still feels unnatural and callous.
Upon reflection I realize why I don‚Äôt need to know him even as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù: he straight up treated me like an object, like a number, like a notch. After we got off the phone, I shed a few tears.
He wanted the banter, my maturity, my interesting life and stories, my face, my body, and our chemistry. He wanted to take.
And he didn‚Äôt want to give me anything other than the bare minimum. His selfishness was repugnant.
My interaction with #notquiteadickpic guy allows me to see my growth over the past few years. I‚Äôm proud of myself for communicating so clearly when I was made uncomfortable by the unsolicited photo AND the unappealing offer to date me on HIS terms.
I don‚Äôt like a lot of conflict, but I see value in my remaining true to myself. In standing up for myself. In honoring boundaries.
I‚Äôve started to realize, too, that maybe my boldness in calling some of this ridiculous behavior out will cause a small change in some of these guys. Maybe the next woman will be treated just a little better.
And maybe not.
Still, it feels good to be more sure-footed in what my relationship and sexual boundaries are. My insecurities and uncertainties are still present, but I‚Äôm proud of myself for the progress I have made over the past several years.
If I can find this courage, truly ANYONE can!
I don‚Äôt always get the chance to say my peace. And that‚Äôs okay, too. Sometimes the best answer is to simply walk away.
But it‚Äôs healing when the opportunity presents itself to tell an uncaring/selfish person (whether you have known them for 2 days or 20 years):
No. You don‚Äôt get to treat me this way.
Bonnie was off the dating market from 1998 (when she met her now ex-husband) till early 2014. She has been online dating on-and-off for over 4 years. She has gone out on at least 100 first dates, interacted with over 1000 guys, and reviewed at least 10000 profiles. If there was a Masters in Online Dating, Bonnie‚Äôs earned it. This means: (1) That Bonnie is a failure at dating AND (2) She‚Äôs accumulated a lot of experiences and knowledge about the dating landscape for middle-aged chicks in Austin.

Being a top writer in love, psychology, and relationships on Medium requires a lot of research when you‚Äôre not actually a psychologist (or married, for that matter).
Recently, I read a book called The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work by John Gottman and Nan Silver. Admittedly, I picked this title because my boyfriend and I plan on getting married soon, and, well, we‚Äôre really hoping to make it work.
The overall idea each of these principles (and every great psychology book I‚Äôve ever read) boils down to this:
According to Gottman and Silver, ‚ÄúFriendship fuels the flames of romance because it offers the best protection against feeling adversarial toward your spouse.‚Äù
Think about it: when you identify your partner as a best friend before a spouse, positive thoughts about him/her become overwhelming disproportionate to the negative thoughts. If you meet a friend for lunch and she forgot to order your sandwich without onion, would you give her ‚Äúthe look‚Äù or start shouting about how ‚Äúselfish and inconsiderate‚Äù she is for not remembering the way you like your sandwich? Of course not; you would you pick off the onions, make a joke about onion breath at the office, and thank her for buying lunch.
The positivity bias of a friendship makes it easy to look past mistakes or small frustrations. Positivity bias occurs when a relationship has had so many positive interactions that negative interactions can be chalked up to an anomaly. Instead of thinking your friend was careless enough to forget that you hate onions, you might attribute the careless mistake to the stress she‚Äôs been under at work lately instead.
Positivity bias makes it easy for both partners ‚Äúto feel optimistic about each other and their marriage, to assume positive things about their lives together, and to give each other the benefit of the doubt‚Äù (source).
The human attachment theory helps to explain the need for best friend behavior in a marital partnership. Research conducted on the attachment theory suggests that humans tend to attach themselves to one primary person when they are upset or scared. ‚ÄúRelationship partners are especially important when people are faced with a stressful event,‚Äù says social psychologist Paula Pietromonaco of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, ‚Äúbecause [partners] have the potential to comfort and calm the person who is experiencing distress or to hinder that person‚Äôs efforts to feel better.‚Äù (Science News)
In other words, happily married couples turn towards each other during an argument ‚Äî even if the argument is about each other ‚Äî because they prioritize each other‚Äôs sense of well-being.
Happily married couples find a way to calm each other down when an argument is escalating, either by making a joke, apologizing, offering a warm embrace, or simply by acknowledging that you both need some time to walk away and cool down.
...as long as you‚Äôve got enough resources to support each other‚Äôs dreams and sustain a desired quality of life. A best friend doesn‚Äôt mind paying for two concert tickets because he/she knows that a concert without their partner would suck. They also never make you feel bad if they pay more than you because they recognize the other ways you contribute to the partnership (i.e. manual labor, acts of kindness, doing the taxes...).
...because the most important part is simply hanging out together ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre sipping insta-worthy cocktails at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas or sharing leftovers out of a styrofoam box in a Motel 6.
...or whatever split both partners see as ‚Äúfair.‚Äù Some couples split household chores by task (I‚Äôll take care of the laundry if you mow the lawn), by day of the week, time of day, or simply by who gets home first. The point isn‚Äôt that the actual workload is split evenly between partners, but that there is a sense of equality in the effort contributed by each person. In fact, best friends may actually take on more chores voluntarily when their partner is feeling sick or stressed out, knowing that he/she would do the same if the roles were reversed. While it may seem uneven at the time, best-friend-first couples trust that this temporary imbalance of effort will even out over the course of their lifetime.
...because you can openly communicate what you like in the bedroom. Couples that are friends before lovers feel a sense of gratification when they play a role in their partner‚Äôs sexual satisfaction; they view sex as a two-player game where the object is not to ‚Äòwin‚Äô, but for both players to have as much fun as possible playing the game. What fun is it unless your best friend is having fun, too?
...and emotionally connected 99% of the time. There might be a few slip-ups here and there (even the most loyal friendships endure forgotten birthdays once in a while) but best-friend-first couples pride themselves on knowing details of one another‚Äôs individual lives. Best friends check in with each other daily to find out how they are feeling, what kind of stresses they‚Äôre facing, and if there is anything they currently need or want. Best friends know each other‚Äôs biggest dreams, inquire about their progress, and celebrate every win (big and small).
...because all couples argue, whether they are happily married or on the brink of divorce. Couples who identify as best friends first, though, fight productively ‚Äî that is, they fight with the intention of resolving a conflict instead of fighting solely to feel emotionally connected. Best friends also respect each other‚Äôs style of fighting as much as they can emotionally handle. The way best-friend couples fight is no different than any other marriage; some people like to retreat for clarity during conflict while others like to confront issues head-on until it‚Äôs resolved. The difference is that best-friend couples have found a way to fight about issues in a way that incorporates both partner‚Äôs style of processing emotions.
Could it really be that simple, though?
According to my grandma, a recent widow after 62 years of marriage with my grandfather, yes ‚Äî as long as you work at remaining best friends throughout the years.
‚ÄúI thought he was the cutest thing on earth,‚Äù she laughed, her eyes lighting up at the memory of meeting my grandfather back in 1956.
If you feel like your relationship is more of a partnership than a friendship, shift your perspective to think, act, and respond the way you would to a best friend.
One of my favorite exercises for cultivating a sense of friendship in your relationship is to act like a puppy (i.e. man‚Äôs best friend) when your partner gets home from work. Get excited! Give them slobbery, passionate kisses, nuzzle your nose in the collar of their shirt, squeeze them in a hug until your arms ache, and tell them how glad you are to be reunited with your best friend in the whole wide world.
As an unknown source once said,
Happily ever after doesn‚Äôt start with a champagne toast at a wedding; it starts the moment you turn towards your partner and realize you‚Äôre looking into the eyes of your very best friend.

He flies under the radar compared to other men. You‚Äôre not that attracted ‚Äî he‚Äôs irritatingly intellectual, a total nerd, somewhat of a killjoy.
But you reconnect later. Maybe it‚Äôs days later, maybe it‚Äôs a year.
He reaches out because of something interesting you wrote. It‚Äôs your writing, it‚Äôs always your writing that draws them in.
He‚Äôs not your usual type, so you have no plans to fall in love.
You discover: he‚Äôs interesting, he‚Äôs fascinating, he might very well be a genius. When he talks about data sets, somehow it‚Äôs poetry to your ears. His hobbies are unexpected and wide-ranging: philosophy, fishing, tango.
He was a terrible student in high school, yet highly accomplished outside of it. Maybe he traveled across Europe for chess tournaments, or around the U.S. for tennis championships, or spent long hours sketching art in a black sketch book.
There was one teacher in particular that believed in him, and that made all the difference.
He‚Äôs extraordinarily successful, astonishingly well-connected. If he was bored in school, he‚Äôs been challenged like no other in his career. He has driven an original idea or ambition to completion, with a discipline and willpower you can only imagine, achieved what most humans could only dream of.
And yet the more successful and brilliant he is in a particular area, the more awkward and incompetent he is in the most basic of others: he forgets to eat, he can‚Äôt pick out his own clothes, he can‚Äôt boil an egg.
But you smile when you learn of these quirks. You find them endearing.
He finds himself talking to you a lot, telling you things he has never told anyone else. You both conclude this must mean your connection is special. He cares about his mom, and his brother or his sister, but he fought a lot with his dad. His dad was narcissistic and cruel, and it‚Äôs an emotional scar that still wounds him today.
He‚Äôs got a penchant for logic games, and he speaks multiple languages. French, German, Japanese ‚Äî you will be entranced the first time you hear him speak another language, amazed by the worlds he floats effortlessly into that you could never know.
He‚Äôs a mathematician, analytical, an engineer, a hacker ‚Äî but above all, he loves to solve problems. There‚Äôs no problem he can‚Äôt solve or won‚Äôt try. To hack his brain, simply suggest a hypothetical problem and watch his mind spin in search of a solution.
He admits that he works a lot, he doesn‚Äôt meet a lot of women, but he‚Äôs looking for the right woman: smart, driven, beautiful. Not one for online dating or apps, he hates dating, and he‚Äôs frustrated and clueless.
You‚Äôre puzzled as to why. There is an aura of mystique that surrounds him when you meet, a kind of power and presence in his energy that he isn‚Äôt even aware of, and that is exactly what makes him so intriguing.
He may unexpectedly sweep you off your feet with his depth, his intensity, his thoughtfulness. Watch him when he‚Äôs lost in thought, for that faraway yet intent look in his eyes.
Suddenly you will find yourself in love with this strange but brilliant man.
When it comes to smart, introverted men, you may very well be the only woman they have liked in awhile. Fatally shy, they may never ask you out.
But if they do, each and every one of them will be almost comically nervous around you. Their hearts will race like crazy the first time they hold your hand, walking along the city‚Äôs waterfront under a starlit night sky.
You will hear the same words over and over from them: You are amazing, you are beautiful, you are gorgeous. Your skin is so soft, you feel so good, we fit so well together.
They say that they love you and that they care a lot about you. Perhaps you decide, against your better judgment, yes, why not, you would like to go on a crazy journey together.
Congratulations: you will know a depth and intensity of a connection few would think possible.
Every time, it‚Äôs the little things that make you love him even more. He‚Äôs attentive to detail, gracefully anticipates your needs. Oddly neurotic in the strangest of ways: afraid of heights, of germs, sensitive to sounds. You‚Äôve never met someone with his sleep patterns: he sleepwalks, he needs very little sleep, he‚Äôs out like a light.
Mostly, he just wants to make you happy. He loves to be with you, just to hear you talk.
You will laugh together, play together, dream up inspiring futures together. In the span of a few minutes, you can shift easily from giggling like silly 4-year-olds to discussing the troubling impact of AI on our species.
You‚Äôll make love. You‚Äôll fuck. Relax blissfully into each other‚Äôs arms. Lulled into a sense of home.
You will know a oneness that transcends worlds, and words.
One day, he will decide to leave you. It will be sudden and swift with no warning.
Troubled at last by doubt, terrified that committing any further will hurt you, triggered by personal traumas, he will decide, quietly, independently ‚Äî because that is how he has solved every problem ‚Äî that it‚Äôs over.
He‚Äôll miss your insights. Your freewheeling conversations. But that‚Äôs it.
His willpower and discipline means you will never hear from him again. The linearity of his mind means he will conclude, like a logic game, you were not meant to be.
He will not look back, QED.
You will never really know why. You will be haunted for days, months, even years. Till the end of time.
When you meet such a man, do not fall in love. You will be demolished, devastated, systematically destroyed, yet again, by yet another smart, introverted man.
Every single time.

Kris Gage|9.5K|5|https://medium.com/@krisgage/things-healthy-couples-dont-fight-about-91e6d2df8ad9?source=tag_archive---------8---------------------|Things Healthy Couples Don‚Äôt Fight About ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Here‚Äôs the difference between healthy and unhealthy couples:
Emotionally healthy people take responsibility for their own emotional health. They are crystal clear on their real needs (without obscuring or abstracting them into other things), and they acknowledge and take primary responsibility for getting them met.
And in a healthy relationship, both people do this.
And this translates into their relationship accordingly.
a.) Because each person is calm and clear on what they need and do the majority of the emotional work upfront, they are fair in what they ask of their partner, and straightforward in how they do so. They don‚Äôt ask unreasonable things, they don‚Äôt obscure their need by asking for something else. (They don‚Äôt push for ‚Äúdate night‚Äù when what they really want is ‚Äúattention.‚Äù They don‚Äôt push for ‚Äúlabels‚Äù when what they really need is ‚Äúcertainty.‚Äù)
And most importantly: they don‚Äôt ask for things they haven‚Äôt already done for themselves.
b.) They invest in their partners‚Äô values ‚Äî the ones they themselves cite, not what we would like them to. They care just as much about their partner‚Äôs needs as they do their own, and they honor them when there‚Äôs need for compromise.
Healthy people also don‚Äôt look to their partner to make them feel happy. Or beautiful. Or secure. Or confident. These emotions are first ours to manage.
Healthy people also never feel like they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt make their partner happy‚ÄùThis may confuse some ‚Äî ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt you say we should care about each other‚Äôs needs?‚Äù And yes, healthy partners do. But there‚Äôs a huge difference in caring about your partner‚Äôs needs and basing your own self-worth or value in the relationship on ‚Äúmaking them happy.‚Äù That‚Äôs no good.
Healthy relationships can‚Äôt happen if both or either person is a codependent who always needs more.
It was Adlai Stevenson who said:
It‚Äôs true. Only emotionally unhealthy, ‚Äúsmall‚Äù people trip themselves up in small matters ‚Äî and pack their own emotions and insecurities (i.e., their identity) into the trivial.
And if that‚Äôs true, then:
Healthy couples don‚Äôt nitpick over small things.
Because problem, of course, is that small people don‚Äôt see this. They‚Äôve convinced themselves that these matters are big. Hence the importance of section 1 ‚Äî emotional health. And a healthy self-worth.
Note: just because ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù fights about something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs actually important. A lot of us distract ourselves with things that don‚Äôt actually matter ‚Äî in life, and in relationships ‚Äî and then get tangled up in a positive-feedback loop by pointing to ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù who‚Äôs doing the same thing.
Even if something bothers ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù (and your mom and best friend totally agree you were in the right), that doesn‚Äôt mean you should tie your insecurities up in it and make it into an ongoing thing.
Guys, chores are one of those things that just sort of have to happen in life. They are background to life ‚Äî not the end-all, be-all of anything. And they definitely should not occupy any serious headspace.
If you are honestly still fighting about the toothpaste, here‚Äôs a pro tip: buy two! This is what my partner and I did, because I‚Äôm the asshole who leaves the tip toothpaste-y and only loosely capped. So we each have our own tube, and it‚Äôs pure non-marital bliss. This ain‚Äôt hard.
Here‚Äôs something we all have to recognize and accept: two people will pretty much never have exactly the same standards of cleanliness. So to one person, the other will always be a slob. To the slob, the other will be a control freak. I have literally been both, depending on the relationship.
We all need to get over the fact that our partner isn‚Äôt going to mirror our exact viewpoint, both compromise and meet halfway, and move on.
(Or those leftovers you were totally saving. Or stealing a fry from your plate.) I‚Äôve heard people consider these deal-breakers, and to be honest I am truly astounded they‚Äôd break up over bagels or baÃÅnh miÃÄ. Like, ain‚Äôt no food worth more than a partner. (The heck is the matter with you people?)
One writer asked,
Honey... the ‚Äúbigger shit‚Äù ‚Äî what‚Äôs ‚Äúactually left to focus on‚Äù ‚Äî is life, man. It‚Äôs life.
It‚Äôs life, and it‚Äôs love. It‚Äôs growing as people, investing in our development, and supporting each other‚Äôs. It‚Äôs choosing work that excites us, whatever it is. It‚Äôs building something, both separately and together. It‚Äôs learning, experiencing, and being present ‚Äî in our own life and in theirs. It‚Äôs living.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs left‚Äù is: everything that actually matters:
...growth, adventure, critical thought, discussion, ideas, support, etc. Anything you want, really, based on good, healthy values ‚Äî which are always more than texts and toilet seats.
For the most part.
Because ‚Äúfighting‚Äù implies that you‚Äôre opponents ‚Äî but you‚Äôre on the same team! If either of you think in terms of ‚Äúwinner‚Äù and ‚Äúloser‚Äù... you‚Äôre both losing.
Of course there‚Äôs still going to be an occasional hiccup, but this isn‚Äôt a healthy default way of communicating.
Unhealthy: Come into conversations on the defense, guns ablazin‚Äô, fired up and hellbent on ‚Äúgetting their point across,‚Äù ‚Äúunloading,‚Äù or ‚Äúgetting heard.‚Äù
Healthy: Seeking to understand the other‚Äôs viewpoint, confident that their partner will do the same, and they communicate fairly when it‚Äôs time.
Healthy couples love. Each person cares for themselves, first and foremost, and they love each other ‚Äî as people. They understand their own needs and do the majority of the work in getting them met, which means they approach their partners warmly and openly, with space to understand and honor their needs as well. In healthy relationships, both people do this. So when disagreements do come up, they both have a solid emotional foundation to work through it in a healthy way.

Bonnie Barton|2.2K|8|https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-middle-aged-dudes-online-dating-guide-2305a07cdd6?source=tag_archive---------9---------------------|The Middle-Aged Dude‚Äôs Online Dating Guide ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"If you are 40ish (and beyond) and brand new to online dating, you are probably incapable of truly comprehending the depths of the insanity. You think you know. But this is one of those experiences that you cannot fully appreciate until you are immersed in it.
My hope is that this story answers some basics for those contemplating jumping into the increasingly murky online dating waters!
One of the reasons that online dating, in particular, is ridiculously confusing is that so few people (men and women) are honest. With themselves. And with others.
I would strongly recommend that you get very real with yourself and do some soul searching before you move forward with setting up an online/app dating profile.
Give serious consideration to what you have time for. How busy are you with your job, kids, ex, travel, hobbies? Are you really ready to jump in emotionally or is it too soon to be dating anyone seriously? Only interested in sex? Cool ‚Äî but BE HONEST!
Potential Catagories:
a) Only looking for sex (Casual sex or an official FWB)
Note: if you are catagory (a), toss up some shirtless selfies and/or other sexy photos, include your weight and height, and state that you are looking for ‚Äúfun/NSA/a hook-up.‚Äù You are done. The rest of my advice doesn‚Äôt apply to you. Except for the scammer info, be wary of them.
b) Just looking to text people because you aren‚Äôt really ready to meet anyone in person (There are a lot of these people out there, though I have yet to see this on anyone‚Äôs profile. Most of them are clueless rather than intentionally malicious and misleading.)
Note: if you are catagory (b), I‚Äôd recommend including decent photos and an abridged profile (for the practice, if nothing else). No problem in messaging/texting/talking to people, but you should come clean fairly soon so that you don‚Äôt waste their time.
It‚Äôs possible that you will eventually move on to (c-f), so I think it‚Äôs fine to be this option until you are ready to move to another catagory.
c) Just looking to meet people (Definitely do not want anything serious and have no plans of dating someone more than a handful of times, if that.)
d) Looking for friends (I‚Äôm not a fan of this approach, but some people like it.)
e) Looking for a short term relationship
f) Looking for a long term relationship
g) Unsure of what you are looking for
Note: I will cut you a bit of slack if you sincerely do not know what you want. Some folks have to meet/interact with people and actually experience online dating to get their heads around it. That‚Äôs fine, but you shouldn‚Äôt stay in (g) for long. Gain some knowledge, then make a determination on which catagory you are.
You don‚Äôt have to necessarily put anything in your profile, but should come clean with your intentions as quickly as possible. (Exception: if you are catagory (a), put that in your profile.)
I am unfailingly grateful when a guy writes that he is looking for an NSA. Or a ‚Äútourguide‚Äù while he‚Äôs in town for the weekend. Or a sub. Or a female bisexual unicorn to join him and his poly dominant partner for play when the moon is 5/6 full and the temperature is above 75 degrees.*
I would steer you to the always fabulous Niki Marinis‚Äô hilarious and truthful story as a starting point.
Unless you are an Adonis, the photos and profile are critical for increased success.
For your first photo, I recommend a 1/2 body CLEAR photo of you solo without sunglasses, baseball caps, or fish.
By all means, get more creative with the remaining photos, but be sure to always include: at least one smiling photo (yep, we are checking out your teeth ‚Äî you‚Äôd be surprised what‚Äôs out there), one full body shot, one photo without sunglasses on, one photo without a cap, and one more serious photo.
Consider including a photo of you in a suit, tux, or whatever your version of ‚Äúdressed up‚Äù is. Most women really do agree with ZZ Top. We love a sharp-dressed man!
If your photos are blurry, not current, contain photos of other women, and/or have children in every picture, I‚Äôm almost certainly going to swipe left. (If you do include women, please mention them in your profile so I have context. Otherwise: I‚Äôm not interested in guessing what that relationship is.)
Personally, if you have three or more people in the first couple of photos, you have already lost me. Too much work, too confusing. I‚Äôm swiping left. Period. A lot of guys make this mistake, please don‚Äôt be one of them.
As Niki mentions, please spend some time to fill out the profile! You don‚Äôt have to be clever just honest and sincere. Of course, the more interesting, charming, and unique you make it, the better your chance of success will be.
Have a cool hobby? Travel somewhere special? Make a mean steak? Use these to your advantage so that you can stand out in a sea of other guys.
A word about height: I acknowledge that it sucks for guys who aren‚Äôt tall! I‚Äôve dated guys from 5'5"" to 6'5"", but many women won‚Äôt look at guys under 6'.
I‚Äôm sorry about that, but go ahead and include your ACTUAL height. Do not make a snarky comment about it and don‚Äôt add 2 inches, just include it in your info matter-of-factly. If a woman passes on you, that‚Äôs her loss. Best to be honest and move along.
I find that most people think they have low enough expectations, but often they end up disappointed. So, yes, most of you will need to lower your expectations even more.
Having said that, if you are decent looking, reasonably in shape or funny or intelligent or charming (or some combination), financially stable, and not trying to date super hot 25 year olds, you should be able to find some awesome chicks.
You are also VERY likely to encounter: emotionally unavailable women, women with walls, women who are going to get wasted a lot (might be fine if you are just looking for some fun sex), confusing women, confused women, women who use sex to get back at an ex, dramatic women, dishonest women.
In fact, let me flesh out what ‚Äúdishonest‚Äù tends to look like for women based on the stories I‚Äôve heard from the guys I have dated/my male friends:
Weight (very common), number of kids (really), age, drug use, ex drama, and/or solely looking for a free meal (more common with younger women).
My tongue-in-cheek attempt at addressing the types of women you are likely to see:
The scammer situation: Yes, that remains a problem, especially for guys. If a woman is too hot, too quick to send photos, inclined to use awkward English (‚Äúfood stuffs‚Äù anyone?), and seems to never be in the hometown she says she‚Äôs from, you‚Äôve probably got a scammer.
Two of the telltale signs are sending you scantily-clad photos immediately and being on vacation/out of town for work. She‚Äôs going to ask you for money to get back home, to visit you, or for a new phone so she can send you even more provocative photos. Walk away.
For me, it is. Even with all the mean dudes, flakes, and users, I wouldn‚Äôt date at all if it weren‚Äôt for online dating.
I have met some very special guys on Bumble/Match/OKCupid. Although my track record is poor, online dating sites/apps gave me two very dear friends, a serious beau, and the opportunity to meet some pretty great guys.
Not everyone out there is a disaster!
One of my close straight guy pals regularly dates online and has had a fair amount of success (and many disappointments, too, of course).
Don‚Äôt sit on the sidelines. Be interesting in your correspondence instead of lazy and predictable. Put yourself out there. Take risks. Be open-minded (and realistic) about potential dates.
When you make a connection, ask her out! See if she‚Äôs really ready to meet you or not. Be direct and try to lock down a meeting time and place. If she demurs, give her a second chance. If she‚Äôs still putting you off, move along.
~Bring your sense of humor and thickest skin at all times! Don‚Äôt take the process any more seriously than necessary.
~Expect weird/bizarre/annoying/even hurtful things to happen as part of the process.
~Yes, you are going to get ghosted, ignored, the run-around, and an array of other alarming behaviors. Most of us do our best to avoid them, but you cannot always tell who is going to suddenly flake out or get weird or become defensive. Be prepared and navigate it as best as you can.
~Remember that most of the ‚Äúbad‚Äù behavior from others has nothing to do with you! Most likely they have their own baggage, their own issues, their own insecurities ‚Äî and those things have zero to do with you.
~Have a sounding board, whether it‚Äôs a therapist, trusted friend, or someone else going through the dating process.
~If you find yourself getting bitter or angry...if you can‚Äôt find your sense of humor or a life lesson in your dating adventures...if you are finding your self confidence taking a hit, then take a break, heal up a bit, and rejoin when you feel more like yourself.
I hope this ‚Äúbeginner‚Äôs guide‚Äù was helpful. Please let me know what else I can address! Feel free to toss out more questions! A special thanks to today‚Äôs muse, Heath ·ãü.

Kathryn Holiday|449|4|https://psiloveyou.xyz/shit-testing-53caff47c62d?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|Shit Testing ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"There is not a woman in existence who doesn‚Äôt shit test. It‚Äôs part of our make up. We are rarely aware, in the midst of a shit test, that we are doing it. It‚Äôs organic. I believe this comes from a woman‚Äôs deep need for security. Due to our natural and biological vulnerabilities we seek protection and security. Shit tests come out of this chronic insecurity. They serve a purpose for us as we use them to ‚Äútest the waters‚Äù to make sure that what existed before still exists. More secure women will test their reality, the solidity of the walls, the availability of resources, the protection and comfort of her man less frequently than a more insecure woman. An insecure woman might test constantly. But all women will test. It will never end. It‚Äôs best to learn how to deal with it instead of fighting it or fighting with the women you love over it.
Sometimes, if we are self-aware and open to thinking critically about ourselves and our actions we can recognize that the fight we picked or the probing question we asked served no purpose at all except as a shit test.
I shit test, sometimes intentionally, but mostly as a reaction or to fill an emotional need that I don‚Äôt quite understand yet. Shit tests are always meant to provoke a response in a man but the source of the problem is always an inner conflict that I haven‚Äôt acknowledged yet. Yeah, life is unfair.
Very often, women do not know what we are feeling in the moment. Our emotions can be intense and even conflicting. Especially now that we have a culture that tries to tell us we are certain ways or are supposed to reject certain things, we feel inadequate or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù when we feel something different. That creates an inner conflict between what we are experiencing and what we think we should be experiencing. That conflict creates a sense of instability as well as a layer of doubt, fear and shame that we are not what we are ‚Äúsupposed to be.‚Äù
Many of these feelings are buried and they come out in surprising, often unproductive ways. One of these ways is the shit test in part because we‚Äôve been told that the origin of our suffering is men (a newer phenomenon) and also because we look to the men in our lives to resolve our problems, even our emotional problems (likely a tendency since the beginning of time).
So, when we are attached to a man we admire or need, we see him as both the cause and solution to our problems. But our problems are not tangible. Our biggest problem is our internal conflict of wanting to feel safe and secure but being biologically insecure on some level.
The shit test is an emotional outburst to gauge if our problem is caused by or can be resolved by the man. However, the shit test is not the problem. It is a symptom of the problem. And like the symptoms of a disease, you can treat the symptoms for temporary relief but if you never address the underlying cause, you will eventually die. Further, fixing the shit test is a red herring; it is a trap. If you respond to the shit test in any way, if you attempt to answer or repair the shit test in any way, you have failed. Because the shit test is a trap to say, ‚ÄúCan I count on you?‚Äù
A woman‚Äôs insecurity and a man‚Äôs ability to tend to it appropriately is the foundation of a relationship‚Äôs success. If you get a woman with a stronger foundation, you will have less work, but there is no foundation that doesn‚Äôt require any maintenance at all. All foundations require reinforcement.
The only appropriate response to a shit test is to dismiss it. You can not take the question seriously. You should not taking responsibility in any way (the cause or the solution) for her inner conflict.
When you ‚Äúanswer‚Äù her shit test, you are acknowledging that there is a crack in the foundation. If you acknowledge the crack then you are liable to be responsible for it. You will be blamed for causing it and you will be made responsible for repairing it.
‚ÄúDo I look fat?‚Äù Classic shit test. A no answer opens possibility that you are lying. If she feels fat enough to ask then your answer is contradicting her feeling. And if your ‚Äúno‚Äù is not convincing enough to obliterate her feeling, she will be angry at you for lying.
A yes answer won‚Äôt help either.
The only way to respond to a shit test is to dismiss it or make a joke as if it‚Äôs ridiculous, but not to answer it either way. Teasing is always effective. Followed by escalating sexually to get her turned on. This also shows her the attention and confirmation of affection she is likely seeking more than an answer.
It is truly not the man‚Äôs problem that she has these inner conflicts. They are a result of our biology clashing with culture, the misinformation spread to women and it is foremost a result of our personal hormonal cocktail.
The solution, of course, is for her to understand her body chemistry better, her moods, her feelings and take personal responsibility for handling them. But even still, our emotions sometimes are several leaps ahead of our minds. So, understanding each other helps a lot too.
Women need to reject the current cultural teachings that tell us that men are the cause of all our problems, that tell us to reject our femininity and suppress our quirks. We must reject the notion that we are supposed to be always strong, steady and in control (aka masculine). In the meantime, helping men understand these shit tests, good ways to respond to them, maybe a little sympathy/empathy for her inner conflicts, is the best we can do.

Kris Gage|24K|7|https://medium.com/@krisgage/signs-they-love-you-b13e65419e8c?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|Signs They Love You ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Most of the things that are listed in these sorts of articles are not love. They are attachment, or infatuation, or flirtation ‚Äî or something just being nice.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it looks across a series of emotions, lukewarm to love.
Here‚Äôs normal stuff that normal people do ‚Äî and should do ‚Äî even with strangers. It doesn‚Äôt even mean they necessarily like you as a person ‚Äî they might just be polite. Especially in the south.
None of these are signs of someone liking you. This is just normal human being stuff, guys.
Congrats, they socialize well and you probably do too.
Again, these aren‚Äôt love. Tiffany Sun just wrote a great post on this ‚Äî ‚Äúthings I wish guys didn‚Äôt take as a mixed signal.‚Äù
But don‚Äôt necessarily love you.
And not only not you, but often in a way that‚Äôs harmful to you, not genuine self-care.
i.e., things people do ‚Äúfor others‚Äù that are really for them.
i.e., a prerequisite to being able to love someone else.
Regardless of any of the above.
Way too many people worry about being ‚Äúfriend-zoned.‚Äù This is a misplaced concern. It‚Äôs a lot easier to transition a friendship into romance than to wring romantic feelings out of not even liking each other as people.
The bigger concern ‚Äî and what‚Äôs really happening for a lot of frustrated daters ‚Äî is that they barely even like you as a person.
They don‚Äôt care about your goals, your values, your fears, or your love language.
The big one is if they have a checklist of qualities they wanted in a partner and you happen to hit them. Or they have a list of stuff they‚Äôve always wanted to do with ‚Äúsomeone,‚Äù and now you‚Äôre working your way through it together. When asked what they like about you, they list different things than how you value yourself (especially if the first one is superficial, like looks.)
They adapted very little to ‚Äúaccommodate‚Äù you into their lives, and if you disappeared tomorrow, they‚Äôd just go on living exactly the same way they always have.
They make you laugh only because they get off on ‚Äúbeing funny.‚Äù They invite you on their trip because they just really want someone to travel with. They share books and music and film and restaurant suggestions because they just get off on sharing or being in the know ‚Äî or they need for you to like the same things ‚Äî not because they care about your opinion. Or they do nice gestures just because they have a deep need to feel ‚Äúappreciated‚Äù and influence over your happiness.
Somehow nothing is ever for them to own ‚Äî and they don‚Äôt want to. Their primary reaction is always to defend themselves, and they‚Äôre never to blame.
I don‚Äôt mean the occasional drifting. I mean a general, persistent feeling of ‚Äúawayness.‚Äù
One day they‚Äôre whispering sweet nothings in your ear, and then they go missing for two weeks.
Like ‚Äúbeautiful.‚Äù
They still make long-term plans without discussing it with you. They still propose weekend plans by saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs where I‚Äôll be if you wanna come.‚Äù
Their ask about your day in a way that‚Äôs half-hearted. They barely care about your struggles, and rarely share your celebrations.
They care about you and your wellbeing separate from themselves and their own.
Nobody can love without self-love. People without self-love will be seemingly ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù and ‚Äúself-less‚Äù but are actually using generosity to mask their deep-seated insecurity and need to build their self esteem around others emotional dependence on them.
They love you if they never check in on you loving them back. They love you if the energy is truly give, not give and ‚Äúnow-where‚Äôs-my-love-or-appreciation-back‚Äù take.
Without strings attached. When they‚Äôre invested in deeply understanding you. And they go out of their way to make you happy.
They rearrange their lives to fit you in.
People love themselves and their own lives, so if they start forgoing any of that to be with you, that‚Äôs a good sign.
It doesn‚Äôt have to be all their free time. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be every day. And it certainly doesn‚Äôt have to be as much as you want, if your idea of ‚Äúenough time‚Äù is higher than theirs. But they do prioritize you.
When you‚Äôre together, you‚Äôre together. They aren‚Äôt zoning out or interrupting while you‚Äôre talking, or eager for a distraction. Their mind is on the moment.
They use words. It may not be the three words you want most to hear, but there will be communication.
They‚Äôre supportive of whatever is most important to you.
Especially their future plans.
Your pain is their pain. Your happiness is their happiness. Your day is their day. Your aspirations are theirs, too.
Theirs as well as your own.

Kris Gage|17.6K|6|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-you-know-it-isnt-love-56939a087080?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|How You Know It Isn‚Äôt Love ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Here are about a dozen ways to tell:
Don‚Äôt talk to me about peaks. Don‚Äôt talk to anybody about peaks ‚Äî not your partner, not your BFF, and especially not yourself.
Everyone experiences the elation of emotional peaks with their partners, and everybody wants to call these feelings ‚Äúlove,‚Äù especially early on. But these are fools gold, and even if you think ‚Äúthis one‚Äôs different, man,‚Äù I‚Äôll tell you again:love is never in the upside.
It‚Äôs in the valleys. And that‚Äôs where you know for sure.
What‚Äôs your gut reaction when things go south? What‚Äôs your lizard brain say when shit hits the fan? I‚Äôm not saying that you should listen to it ‚Äî lizard brains are notoriously stupid, and often need to be shushed and guided by more mature and developed thinking ‚Äî but I am saying you should notice.Because love is neither fight nor flight; love doubles-down, joins forces, makes it work. If your reaction is to throw punches or throw in the towel, it‚Äôs not love.
Look, just don‚Äôt talk about love in terms of feelings ‚Äî and this definitely includes ‚Äúinfatuation‚Äù or ‚Äúpreoccupation‚Äù or ‚Äúobsession‚Äù or ‚Äúcan‚Äôt live without‚Äù (see above.)
Talk about feelings all you want ‚Äî they are incredibly wonderful parts of the human experience ‚Äî and feel All Of The Feelings for your partner, because those are some of the juiciest. Just also understand that love is a choice, an active decision, and a series of investments and efforts and actions. Theproblem with defining love as ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù is twofold: 1.) it makes for immature relationships, and 2.) leaves us susceptible to one day ‚Äúnot feeling it‚Äù and folding.
Not just for a moment (because that happens to all of us) and also not as the result of depression (look into that to make sure), but rather a pervasivefeeling of not actually connecting.
This is different than feelings ‚Äúfading,‚Äù as mentioned above. You can still care deeply for someone but feel lonely every time you‚Äôre together. If you don‚Äôt actually connect, it will never be the making of a rich relationship.
I dated one dude for a while, when we were young and dumb and didn‚Äôt know what we didn‚Äôt know, and we thought this was well enough how love was supposed to look. But I can pinpoint the exact moment I realized we should break up. We were at the mall, killing time on another empty afternoon, not even walking around or actually shopping but just standing there, leaning on a railing and looking down at a lower level. And all of a sudden I was overcome with this immense loneliness ‚Äî not in the moment, but rather the sudden and undeniable realization that I was always lonely with him. We were never truly together; never really seeing each other eye to eye; instead just rushing around to distract ourselves from it. And once we stopped and stared at nothing long enough for me to see it, I couldn‚Äôt go back to unseeing.
Honestly, I either have no idea what ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù means or I just bundle it into other things (like ‚Äúintellectual companions,‚Äù and ‚Äúfriendship,‚Äù and ‚Äúconversation,‚Äù see below.)
But I guess it‚Äôs worth including because so many people do: if you continually come back to ‚Äúthe way your partner looks on paper‚Äù to defend the relationship to yourself, it‚Äôs probably going south.
This, as I said, is probably just my ‚Äúchemistry,‚Äù but either way it is, in my mind, a very important, stand-alone thing.
I dated a dude for five years who was plenty ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and successful in his own right, but he and I fundamentally operated in very different ways. I never felt as though I had an intellectual companion, and I spent years thinking, ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs fine ‚Äî we all make sacrifices in love. There is no perfect partner.‚Äù
But there‚Äôs a difference between rooting for different sports teams and being able to have the conversations you care most about. When I shared my most cherished thoughts or abstract questions ‚Äî like ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it interesting how people choose to build their lives?‚Äù ‚Äî looking to volley answers or even (dream big!) build a full-blown discussion, he would absentmindedly quell it with, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way things are ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt mean anything.‚Äù Full stop.
When it comes to a ‚Äúlife partner,‚Äù make sure they‚Äôre actually there for the ‚Äúlife stuff.‚Äù
Like if you share big news with your partner (you got promoted, won a deal, quit that job you hated, whatever) they shouldn‚Äôt sound as though you just said you grabbed milk on the way home.
Ditto for death.
They should hug you if you‚Äôre crying, offer to go to the services (and actually go, if you want them to and they can), and refrain from making jokes too soon or demanding brownie points if they order flowers. This is easy stuff, guys. Yet it‚Äôs amazing how many people eff this up.
After my brother died unexpectedly (and then a job offer fell through only after I‚Äôd quit my previous position), I came down with the worst cold (or flu) of my life ‚Äî the kind where your nose simply won‚Äôt stop running and you can‚Äôt manage basic functions and you‚Äôre so physically fatigued you can‚Äôt even go to the grocery to get drugs for it. My boyfriend and I lived together at the time, but he was so oblivious that after a day and a half I dragged myself, zombie-like, to the drug store two blocks away and bought my own meds, and was so exhausted by the time I got back that I crashed on the couch for hours afterwards.
For anybody who‚Äôs sitting there thinking, ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you just ask him?‚Äù Iseriously encourage you to reevaluate your standards of basic human decency and awareness. Normally ‚Äúasking‚Äù is correct. But damn, son.
With the biggest catalyst being ‚Äúmoving.‚Äù
When they move across the country (or the world) and you are in no way inclined to follow (except, perhaps, ‚Äúfor the adventure.‚Äù) Or, vice versa, when you feel compelled to move across the country but only half-care if they come.
If you think you love someone because they‚Äôre ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù or ‚Äúgiving‚Äù or ‚Äúmake you feel good‚Äù or some other self-serving pleasure, then you should realize: that‚Äôs not real love.
That‚Äôs not to say you don‚Äôt (or can‚Äôt) really love them, but ‚Äúthe pleasure they give you‚Äù (or, in codependent cases, the pleasure you give them) can never be the foundation.
Just go re-read the first section, honestly.
Mature love is based on healthy non-attachment
I don‚Äôt understand how anybody could ever think it‚Äôs ‚Äúromantic‚Äù for someone to declare, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to marry you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have kids with you‚Äù shortly after meeting them.
Gross. Get out of here with that grabby shit.
One dude I dated said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make you my wife‚Äù within a couple months of knowing me, and my knee jerk reaction was: ‚Äúwow ‚Äî does he not realize I have a say in this?‚Äù
The most interesting part was: I had come home from our first date feeling the same way. But the fact that he said it so matter of factly, without me ever verbally weighing in on the matter, turned me off so much it couldn‚Äôt be salvaged. It wasn‚Äôt cute and it wasn‚Äôt romantic ‚Äî even though our feelings had once aligned, because I realized that that fact didn‚Äôt actually matter to him.
It was presumptuous and off-putting and poor form. If you find this romantic, you really need to check your idea of personal agency and emotionalboundaries.
And that realization is, on the one hand, weird ‚Äî because I make decisions like this all the time with my partners (love is, after all, choice and commitment) so I‚Äôm not sure where the line is in whether ‚Äúdeciding‚Äù is love or ownership. Maybe it has to do with actually knowing the other person (as discerned by them, not you.) Either way, all I know is that when it aligns in the right way, it feels really good. And when it doesn‚Äôt, and they claim more of you than you offered or chose, it‚Äôs heart-wrenching. And it‚Äôs only worse if youdid choose or offer, only differently or less, because they don‚Äôt care and your left standing there with your heart in your hand.
Fear and love can‚Äôt coexist. If your primary anxiety around the idea of breaking up is ‚Äúfear of being alone,‚Äù it isn‚Äôt love.
Embracing each other as individual human beings with individual human being lives, who just happen to get along enough to bump down the road alongside one another.
Then, mutual investment and support in each other‚Äôs growth, especially when things get rough or scary. But always complementary, never to complete one another. And always with care and compassion.
Or clap or follow!

Kris Gage|10.1K|7|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-much-to-give-and-take-in-relationships-ccbdf31e2f4e?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|How Much To Give And Take In Relationships ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"I always have a big question in my head, and it‚Äôs always about love ‚Äî and life.
After I broke up with my boyfriend of five years in 2014, my question was around ‚Äúpersonal agency‚Äù and ‚Äúreal love‚Äù ‚Äî specifically, whether someone can really love us if they see us differently (lesser and more superficially) than we see ourselves; if there is no ‚Äútrue‚Äù reality, then which version of ‚Äúus‚Äù is real? Do we get final say in who we are and how we want to be seen (and loved?) (Side note: after 3 years and countless books, Emma Lindsay‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúFish Love‚Äù is the closest and best answer I found.)
Last year, it was around emotional abuse ‚Äî and what constitutes it ‚Äî which lead to healthy vs. toxic love. (bell hooks had the best answers here.)
And that evolved into my big question this year, which is around ‚Äúemotional boundaries.‚Äù
If you don‚Äôt agree, it‚Äôs almost certainly because you don‚Äôt (yet) realize you struggle with them. Because pretty much the only people with healthy emotional boundaries are the ones who have conscientiously and deliberately put in the emotion work to build them.
We don‚Äôt learn them from our family. (In fact, if anything, we learn the opposite from our families, most of whom are either too invasive, too dependent, or too enabling and end up encouraging our dependency on them.)
We can‚Äôt learn them from media, which is so ill with bad relationship and love models it should all be regarded as satire at best.
And we don‚Äôt learn them from others, because everyone struggles with them (see above) and some even see ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù as being ‚Äúclosed off.‚Äù These people have a lot of emotion work to do, and should get their hands on some codependence reading.
This leaves the internet and books, but most of the advice there is equally bad.
A lot of relationship books don‚Äôt even address the concept of emotional boundaries (or emotional health) ‚Äî or worse, they actively encourage people to develop unhealthy ones, which sets everyone up for suffering.
Even books on boundaries beat around the bush, instead covering ‚Äúhow important they are‚Äù (great; duh) or ‚Äúhow to stand up for yourself‚Äù and ‚Äúsay no.‚Äù But those aren‚Äôt the real issue we have, evidenced by the fact that most of us sway erratically from one end of the spectrum to the other in attempt to find balance. We first find ourselves feeling ‚Äúwalked on‚Äù and then pick a fight over stupid shit to get even.
So far most books fail to address the real issue in emotional boundaries:
We all understand the logistics of how to not eat a cookie. (You say ‚Äúno thank you,‚Äù you don‚Äôt pick it up, you don‚Äôt take a bite. Done.) That‚Äôs not the hard part.
The hard part is discerning whether or not we really want to eat the cookie.
If we don‚Äôt eat the cookie, are we avoiding it from a position of peace, or self-punishment ‚Äî or pride? If we eat the cookie, is it with pleasure or lack of self-love? Do we actually want it? Will we regret it tomorrow? Do we want it because we‚Äôre bored, or we‚Äôve had a beer, or a stressful day, or our host is extending it to us on a plate and smiling at us with those eyes that plead, ‚Äúplease ‚Äî I spent an hour baking these.‚Äù Are any of those real desires? Should any of those be regarded as real desires? Is a cookie ever an appropriate vehicle for satisfying them? Is it ever appropriate to just say ‚Äúah, fuck it‚Äù and eat the cookie without identifying our real, underlying needs?
This is the hard part with boundaries ‚Äî understanding what we truly want, beneath the surface, and what‚Äôs healthy.
And a simple, innocent cookie bears like 1/1000th the weight of a person.
And if you think I‚Äôm maybe overthinking the cookie thing, I‚Äôll remind you: the cookie was a metaphor, bud. For boundaries. And if anything, we‚Äôre under-thinking those.
Before anybody gets pissy over that, let me clarify: you are entitled to feel your feelings. But that doesn‚Äôt mean your feelings are always reasonable or anybody else‚Äôs problem. And without emotion work, they can‚Äôt define emotional boundaries.
Resources on emotional boundaries often advise the reader to simply ‚Äúunderstand what upsets, hurts, or offends‚Äù us. One article said, ‚ÄúWhen you feel anger or resentment or find yourself whining or complaining, you probably need to set a boundary. Listen to yourself, determine what you need to do or say, then communicate assertively.‚Äù
What horrible advice.
I mean, maybe, sometimes that‚Äôs valid. But maybe (most times) you need to deal with your own emotions before putting them back on others. Maybe your reason for feeling anger or resentment or jealousy or insecurity is your own problem.
If everyone followed bad advice like the above, we‚Äôd all be running around with the emotional development of children, believing every whimper that crossed our tiny brains had to be validated and honored.
Guys, no. Part of being an adult (and developing emotional boundaries) is also about being able to discern which emotions are yours alone to deal with, and not project on others.
Sometimes people struggle to stand up for their feelings. Sometimes people struggle to understand the world isn‚Äôt responsible for soothing everything they feel. Most people struggle with discerning the difference, and bounce back and forth between the two.
So: the question here is on emotion work, really. How to manage our own emotions, and being able to appropriately discern what‚Äôs ours to fix (hint: most of it), and what‚Äôs valid / for other people.
Often these resources brush people off with advice like: ‚Äúknow your boundary and then say no.‚Äù And to that shit I‚Äôm like, thanks Barbara.
The problem is we‚Äôre all so bad at it, so we don‚Äôt have the privilege of trusting our own judgment yet. So who decides? Or, better yet: how do we know when we can? What if we don‚Äôt care? Should we?
I grab fries off my partner‚Äôs plate and borrow his clothes all the time without asking. I moved across the country for him. I listen when he jumps straight to ‚Äúproblem solving‚Äù when I share something.
Are those poor boundaries?? Even if neither of us cares, should we? Hell, even if we think we‚Äôre happy, should we be?
We are subconsciously socialized to empathize with other people‚Äôs feelings, but then we‚Äôre told not to take on other people‚Äôs feelings.
We‚Äôre told to ‚Äústand up for ourselves‚Äù but also ‚Äúsurrender to love.‚Äù We‚Äôre told to ‚Äúsay no‚Äù but never ‚Äúshut down.‚Äù
We‚Äôre warned against becoming ‚Äúemotionally exhausted‚Äù after talking to others, but we‚Äôre also warned against ‚Äúwithdrawing‚Äù or ‚Äúwalling others out.‚Äù
We‚Äôre told ‚Äúthe opposite of love is not ‚Äòhate‚Äô but ‚Äòapathy‚Äô‚Äù (or maybe ‚Äúfear?‚Äù), which means loving is caring ‚Äî but what‚Äôs too much?
We‚Äôre not supposed to sacrifice our dreams for relationships, but most dreams are fantasies anyway. (Would you reeaally move to a cabin in Vermont??)
When it comes to others‚Äô emotions, it makes sense: be open to others but don‚Äôt take on their emotions as your own. Fine. It‚Äôs not actually as clear it sounds, in practice, but it‚Äôs fine enough on paper. (Eat the cookie without becoming it. Eat the cookie without needing to identify as ‚Äúcookie eater.‚Äù Fine.)
But what about our own emotions, thoughts, preferences, ideas? And how should those two come together? How do we make this all work? How do we discern and compromise?
Like: it‚Äôs always bad when people try to change their partners. Except it‚Äôs not always bad, because there are caveats like: if their habit is objectively bad, like smoking. But what if it‚Äôs subjectively bad, or just sort of bad? Who gets to decide? Do they compromise? Should both have to give 50% if the habit is only regarding one person‚Äôs body or life? How much agency do we have over one another? And how does their agency affect our own?
It all comes down to better understanding of ‚Äî and responsibility for ‚Äî our own feelings and thoughts and what we truly want most, and expecting the same of people in our life.

Bonnie Barton|11.9K|7|https://psiloveyou.xyz/i-called-out-a-guy-who-wanted-to-use-me-cd9463b6b041?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|I Called Out a Guy Who Wanted to Use Me ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"I read two stories over the weekend that collided in my brain.
(Shani Silver‚Äôs ‚Äú5 Bullsh*t Dating Practices That Have Jumped the Shark‚Äù and Jessica Wildfire‚Äôs ‚ÄúGuys, stop sending pictures of your junk.‚Äù)
They intersect with my most recent crash-and-burn interaction with another online dating dude.
I met him online a few weeks ago. He quickly provided the link to his professional website. He sent a short video of himself and his dog.
He communicated easily and checked in with me. I appreciated his effort to share small snippets of his life.
I liked his transparency. This felt more ‚Äúreal‚Äù than many of the interactions I have with men who I meet online.
By showing who he was and texting to ask about me, it felt like he was attempting to forge an authentic connection.
(I‚Äôve done this long enough to know that ANYTHING can happen. But it was an encouraging start.)
Eventually we got a little flirty. I took this opportunity to throw in some comments that would indicate I was not into any sort of dick pic, S&M/fetish relationship, or a casual sexual interaction.
We specifically discussed that men tend to be more visual while women are less so. He confirmed that he was very visual. I explicitly told him that I need to know someone better before I would ever want a suggestive photo of him.
I even acknowledged that no one had ever sent me a dick pic and I had no intention of soliciting one!
Fast forward an hour or two and he began asking for a photo of me. I responded that I hate selfies (true) and I wasn‚Äôt sure what I had on my phone.
Dude: It doesn‚Äôt have to be of your face.
Me (dawning realization of what he was really asking for)
A few moments later I realized that I had no desire to give this stranger a photo of myself.
Me: ‚ÄúActually, you can just look at the photos on my profile.‚Äù (I had about 10 posted on my profile.)
Dude: ‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù
He then asked if I wanted a photo of him. I told him that I did not. It was too soon. (We had not talked on the phone or met in person. We had only been texting for a day or two.)
Within a few minutes, he sent me a picture of himself in bed (presumably naked) cropped to just shy of his genitals.
I. was. pissed!
I had SUCH a strong reaction. Which caught me off guard.
I immediately deleted the photo and reamed him out.
I told him that I had deleted the photo. That I didn‚Äôt appreciate him sending me a photo of him in that position when I had already told him unequivocally that I had no interest in a risque photo of him.
I told him that I did not feel like he was listening to me. And that I didn‚Äôt like that AT ALL!
To his credit, he apologized immediately.
Bonnie from 4 years ago would have frozen and panicked. I probably would have just immediately blocked him.
I might have blamed myself somehow.
Bonnie of today doesn‚Äôt take that crap!
This guy‚Äôs behavior was boorish and misguided, but perhaps no one had ever called him out for it. (And, of course, technically it was not a dick pic.)
Or even more likely, I suspect a certain percentage of women have reciprocated with a similar photo. Which is fine. But it muddies the waters for guys. Well, for all of us.
It was a little scary to be so direct with a complete stranger. It occurred to me that he would most likely respond by getting angry or defensive with me. Or ghosting me entirely.
He was cute, smart, had a good job, I enjoyed texting him, and he seemed interesting. But I was going to call him out anyway and risk blowing this thing before I had even met him.
Nonetheless, I stuck to my guns.
And it felt good.
I accepted his apology and we did go out a couple of times.
It ended abruptly when he made it clear he wanted to sow oats with me and other women. I was fine with dating him, but told him that I would not be having a sexual relationship while he was sleeping with other women.
He said he wasn‚Äôt willing to wait.
I simply stated: ‚ÄúFair enough. Thank you for being honest. We are at an impasse.‚Äù
I assumed I would not hear from again.
He surprised me a few hours later by texting me about my night. Then he asked if he could stay over sometime. I was flabbergasted. I ended up calling him and reassuring him that I was not playing some sort of game.
There was nothing he could say or do that would change my mind regarding this matter.
As for him, I had told him what type of relationship I was comfortable with and he had declined. I had no intention of engaging in an argument with a grown adult. He had clearly communicated that he was unwilling to wait for a sexual relationship with me. I took him at his word.
I did, however, take the opportunity on the phone to point out what he was offering me: To ‚Äúdate‚Äù me. Under his scenario that meant that he could sleep with someone the prior night, then sleep with me, then sleep with someone else the next night.
I stated again that that offer was unappealing to me.
He simply muttered that ‚Äúit wouldn‚Äôt really be like that.‚Äù I countered: ‚ÄúOh,no. That is EXACTLY what you are asking of me.‚Äù
I was not going to let him try to spin this.
He said he was a friendly guy. That he liked our chemistry and our banter. That I was mature and interesting. That he wanted to see me again.
Me (very calmly and directly, not bitchy): ‚ÄúYeah, I think I‚Äôm going to pass. Usually I can stay in touch or be friends, but I don‚Äôt think I need to with you.‚Äù
We knew there was nowhere for this conversation to go, so we politely parted ways.
Even after all these years, it‚Äôs not easy for me to be treated like this. It hurts me. I can tolerate it better than I used to, but it still feels unnatural and callous.
Upon reflection I realize why I don‚Äôt need to know him even as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù: he straight up treated me like an object, like a number, like a notch. After we got off the phone, I shed a few tears.
He wanted the banter, my maturity, my interesting life and stories, my face, my body, and our chemistry. He wanted to take.
And he didn‚Äôt want to give me anything other than the bare minimum. His selfishness was repugnant.
My interaction with #notquiteadickpic guy allows me to see my growth over the past few years. I‚Äôm proud of myself for communicating so clearly when I was made uncomfortable by the unsolicited photo AND the unappealing offer to date me on HIS terms.
I don‚Äôt like a lot of conflict, but I see value in my remaining true to myself. In standing up for myself. In honoring boundaries.
I‚Äôve started to realize, too, that maybe my boldness in calling some of this ridiculous behavior out will cause a small change in some of these guys. Maybe the next woman will be treated just a little better.
And maybe not.
Still, it feels good to be more sure-footed in what my relationship and sexual boundaries are. My insecurities and uncertainties are still present, but I‚Äôm proud of myself for the progress I have made over the past several years.
If I can find this courage, truly ANYONE can!
I don‚Äôt always get the chance to say my peace. And that‚Äôs okay, too. Sometimes the best answer is to simply walk away.
But it‚Äôs healing when the opportunity presents itself to tell an uncaring/selfish person (whether you have known them for 2 days or 20 years):
No. You don‚Äôt get to treat me this way.
Bonnie was off the dating market from 1998 (when she met her now ex-husband) till early 2014. She has been online dating on-and-off for over 4 years.

Rachel Clements|6.7K|7|https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-1-thing-all-happily-married-couples-have-in-common-b8fabbe53bbe?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|The #1 Thing All Happily Married Couples Have in Common|"I read a lot about relationships.
Being a top writer in love, psychology, and relationships on Medium requires a lot of research when you‚Äôre not actually a psychologist (or married, for that matter).
Recently, I read a book called The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work by John Gottman and Nan Silver. Admittedly, I picked this title because my boyfriend and I plan on getting married soon, and, well, we‚Äôre really hoping to make it work.
The overall idea each of these principles (and every great psychology book I‚Äôve ever read) boils down to this:
According to Gottman and Silver, ‚ÄúFriendship fuels the flames of romance because it offers the best protection against feeling adversarial toward your spouse.‚Äù
Think about it: when you identify your partner as a best friend before a spouse, positive thoughts about him/her become overwhelming disproportionate to the negative thoughts. If you meet a friend for lunch and she forgot to order your sandwich without onion, would you give her ‚Äúthe look‚Äù or start shouting about how ‚Äúselfish and inconsiderate‚Äù she is for not remembering the way you like your sandwich? Of course not; you would you pick off the onions, make a joke about onion breath at the office, and thank her for buying lunch.
The positivity bias of a friendship makes it easy to look past mistakes or small frustrations. Positivity bias occurs when a relationship has had so many positive interactions that negative interactions can be chalked up to an anomaly. Instead of thinking your friend was careless enough to forget that you hate onions, you might attribute the careless mistake to the stress she‚Äôs been under at work lately instead.
Positivity bias makes it easy for both partners ‚Äúto feel optimistic about each other and their marriage, to assume positive things about their lives together, and to give each other the benefit of the doubt‚Äù (source).
The human attachment theory helps to explain the need for best friend behavior in a marital partnership. Research conducted on the attachment theory suggests that humans tend to attach themselves to one primary person when they are upset or scared. ‚ÄúRelationship partners are especially important when people are faced with a stressful event,‚Äù says social psychologist Paula Pietromonaco of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, ‚Äúbecause [partners] have the potential to comfort and calm the person who is experiencing distress or to hinder that person‚Äôs efforts to feel better.‚Äù (Science News)
In other words, happily married couples turn towards each other during an argument ‚Äî even if the argument is about each other ‚Äî because they prioritize each other‚Äôs sense of well-being.
Happily married couples find a way to calm each other down when an argument is escalating, either by making a joke, apologizing, offering a warm embrace, or simply by acknowledging that you both need some time to walk away and cool down.
...as long as you‚Äôve got enough resources to support each other‚Äôs dreams and sustain a desired quality of life. A best friend doesn‚Äôt mind paying for two concert tickets because he/she knows that a concert without their partner would suck. They also never make you feel bad if they pay more than you because they recognize the other ways you contribute to the partnership (i.e. manual labor, acts of kindness, doing the taxes...).
...because the most important part is simply hanging out together ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre sipping insta-worthy cocktails at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas or sharing leftovers out of a styrofoam box in a Motel 6.
...or whatever split both partners see as ‚Äúfair.‚Äù Some couples split household chores by task (I‚Äôll take care of the laundry if you mow the lawn), by day of the week, time of day, or simply by who gets home first. The point isn‚Äôt that the actual workload is split evenly between partners, but that there is a sense of equality in the effort contributed by each person. In fact, best friends may actually take on more chores voluntarily when their partner is feeling sick or stressed out, knowing that he/she would do the same if the roles were reversed. While it may seem uneven at the time, best-friend-first couples trust that this temporary imbalance of effort will even out over the course of their lifetime.
...because you can openly communicate what you like in the bedroom. Couples that are friends before lovers feel a sense of gratification when they play a role in their partner‚Äôs sexual satisfaction; they view sex as a two-player game where the object is not to ‚Äòwin‚Äô, but for both players to have as much fun as possible playing the game. What fun is it unless your best friend is having fun, too?
...and emotionally connected 99% of the time. There might be a few slip-ups here and there (even the most loyal friendships endure forgotten birthdays once in a while) but best-friend-first couples pride themselves on knowing details of one another‚Äôs individual lives. Best friends check in with each other daily to find out how they are feeling, what kind of stresses they‚Äôre facing, and if there is anything they currently need or want. Best friends know each other‚Äôs biggest dreams, inquire about their progress, and celebrate every win (big and small).
...because all couples argue, whether they are happily married or on the brink of divorce. Couples who identify as best friends first, though, fight productively ‚Äî that is, they fight with the intention of resolving a conflict instead of fighting solely to feel emotionally connected. Best friends also respect each other‚Äôs style of fighting as much as they can emotionally handle. The way best-friend couples fight is no different than any other marriage; some people like to retreat for clarity during conflict while others like to confront issues head-on until it‚Äôs resolved. The difference is that best-friend couples have found a way to fight about issues in a way that incorporates both partner‚Äôs style of processing emotions.
Could it really be that simple, though?
According to my grandma, a recent widow after 62 years of marriage with my grandfather, yes ‚Äî as long as you work at remaining best friends throughout the years.
‚ÄúI thought he was the cutest thing on earth,‚Äù she laughed, her eyes lighting up at the memory of meeting my grandfather back in 1956.
If you feel like your relationship is more of a partnership than a friendship, shift your perspective to think, act, and respond the way you would to a best friend.
One of my favorite exercises for cultivating a sense of friendship in your relationship is to act like a puppy (i.e. man‚Äôs best friend) when your partner gets home from work. Get excited! Give them slobbery, passionate kisses, nuzzle your nose in the collar of their shirt, squeeze them in a hug until your arms ache, and tell them how glad you are to be reunited with your best friend in the whole wide world.
As an unknown source once said,
Happily ever after doesn‚Äôt start with a champagne toast at a wedding; it starts the moment you turn towards your partner and realize you‚Äôre looking into the eyes of your very best friend.

Jennifer Lowe|7.6K|4|https://psiloveyou.xyz/do-not-fall-in-love-with-a-smart-introverted-man-8792ac8ca4cd?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|Do not fall in love with a smart, introverted man ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"You overlook him at first.
He flies under the radar compared to other men. You‚Äôre not that attracted ‚Äî he‚Äôs irritatingly intellectual, a total nerd, somewhat of a killjoy.
But you reconnect later. Maybe it‚Äôs days later, maybe it‚Äôs a year.
He reaches out because of something interesting you wrote. It‚Äôs your writing, it‚Äôs always your writing that draws them in.
He‚Äôs not your usual type, so you have no plans to fall in love.
You discover: he‚Äôs interesting, he‚Äôs fascinating, he might very well be a genius. When he talks about data sets, somehow it‚Äôs poetry to your ears. His hobbies are unexpected and wide-ranging: philosophy, fishing, tango.
He was a terrible student in high school, yet highly accomplished outside of it. Maybe he traveled across Europe for chess tournaments, or around the U.S. for tennis championships, or spent long hours sketching art in a black sketch book.
There was one teacher in particular that believed in him, and that made all the difference.
He‚Äôs extraordinarily successful, astonishingly well-connected. If he was bored in school, he‚Äôs been challenged like no other in his career. He has driven an original idea or ambition to completion, with a discipline and willpower you can only imagine, achieved what most humans could only dream of.
And yet the more successful and brilliant he is in a particular area, the more awkward and incompetent he is in the most basic of others: he forgets to eat, he can‚Äôt pick out his own clothes, he can‚Äôt boil an egg.
But you smile when you learn of these quirks. You find them endearing.
He finds himself talking to you a lot, telling you things he has never told anyone else. You both conclude this must mean your connection is special. He cares about his mom, and his brother or his sister, but he fought a lot with his dad. His dad was narcissistic and cruel, and it‚Äôs an emotional scar that still wounds him today.
He‚Äôs got a penchant for logic games, and he speaks multiple languages. French, German, Japanese ‚Äî you will be entranced the first time you hear him speak another language, amazed by the worlds he floats effortlessly into that you could never know.
He‚Äôs a mathematician, analytical, an engineer, a hacker ‚Äî but above all, he loves to solve problems. There‚Äôs no problem he can‚Äôt solve or won‚Äôt try. To hack his brain, simply suggest a hypothetical problem and watch his mind spin in search of a solution.
He admits that he works a lot, he doesn‚Äôt meet a lot of women, but he‚Äôs looking for the right woman: smart, driven, beautiful. Not one for online dating or apps, he hates dating, and he‚Äôs frustrated and clueless.
You‚Äôre puzzled as to why. There is an aura of mystique that surrounds him when you meet, a kind of power and presence in his energy that he isn‚Äôt even aware of, and that is exactly what makes him so intriguing.
He may unexpectedly sweep you off your feet with his depth, his intensity, his thoughtfulness. Watch him when he‚Äôs lost in thought, for that faraway yet intent look in his eyes.
Suddenly you will find yourself in love with this strange but brilliant man.
When it comes to smart, introverted men, you may very well be the only woman they have liked in awhile. Fatally shy, they may never ask you out.
But if they do, each and every one of them will be almost comically nervous around you. Their hearts will race like crazy the first time they hold your hand, walking along the city‚Äôs waterfront under a starlit night sky.
You will hear the same words over and over from them: You are amazing, you are beautiful, you are gorgeous. Your skin is so soft, you feel so good, we fit so well together.
They say that they love you and that they care a lot about you. Perhaps you decide, against your better judgment, yes, why not, you would like to go on a crazy journey together.
Congratulations: you will know a depth and intensity of a connection few would think possible.
Every time, it‚Äôs the little things that make you love him even more. He‚Äôs attentive to detail, gracefully anticipates your needs. Oddly neurotic in the strangest of ways: afraid of heights, of germs, sensitive to sounds. You‚Äôve never met someone with his sleep patterns: he sleepwalks, he needs very little sleep, he‚Äôs out like a light.
Mostly, he just wants to make you happy. He loves to be with you, just to hear you talk.
You will laugh together, play together, dream up inspiring futures together. In the span of a few minutes, you can shift easily from giggling like silly 4-year-olds to discussing the troubling impact of AI on our species.
You‚Äôll make love. You‚Äôll fuck. Relax blissfully into each other‚Äôs arms. Lulled into a sense of home.
You will know a oneness that transcends worlds, and words.
One day, he will decide to leave you. It will be sudden and swift with no warning.
Troubled at last by doubt, terrified that committing any further will hurt you, triggered by personal traumas, he will decide, quietly, independently ‚Äî because that is how he has solved every problem ‚Äî that it‚Äôs over.
He‚Äôll miss your insights. Your freewheeling conversations. But that‚Äôs it.
His willpower and discipline means you will never hear from him again. The linearity of his mind means he will conclude, like a logic game, you were not meant to be.
He will not look back, QED.
You will never really know why. You will be haunted for days, months, even years. Till the end of time.
When you meet such a man, do not fall in love. You will be demolished, devastated, systematically destroyed, yet again, by yet another smart, introverted man.
Every single time.

Kris Gage|9.5K|5|https://medium.com/@krisgage/things-healthy-couples-dont-fight-about-91e6d2df8ad9?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|Things Healthy Couples Don‚Äôt Fight About ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Here‚Äôs the difference between healthy and unhealthy couples:
Emotionally healthy people take responsibility for their own emotional health. They are crystal clear on their real needs (without obscuring or abstracting them into other things), and they acknowledge and take primary responsibility for getting them met.
And in a healthy relationship, both people do this.
And this translates into their relationship accordingly.
a.) Because each person is calm and clear on what they need and do the majority of the emotional work upfront, they are fair in what they ask of their partner, and straightforward in how they do so. They don‚Äôt ask unreasonable things, they don‚Äôt obscure their need by asking for something else. (They don‚Äôt push for ‚Äúdate night‚Äù when what they really want is ‚Äúattention.‚Äù They don‚Äôt push for ‚Äúlabels‚Äù when what they really need is ‚Äúcertainty.‚Äù)
And most importantly: they don‚Äôt ask for things they haven‚Äôt already done for themselves.
b.) They invest in their partners‚Äô values ‚Äî the ones they themselves cite, not what we would like them to. They care just as much about their partner‚Äôs needs as they do their own, and they honor them when there‚Äôs need for compromise.
Healthy people also don‚Äôt look to their partner to make them feel happy. Or beautiful. Or secure. Or confident. These emotions are first ours to manage.
Healthy people also never feel like they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt make their partner happy‚ÄùThis may confuse some ‚Äî ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt you say we should care about each other‚Äôs needs?‚Äù And yes, healthy partners do. But there‚Äôs a huge difference in caring about your partner‚Äôs needs and basing your own self-worth or value in the relationship on ‚Äúmaking them happy.‚Äù That‚Äôs no good.
Healthy relationships can‚Äôt happen if both or either person is a codependent who always needs more.
It was Adlai Stevenson who said:
It‚Äôs true. Only emotionally unhealthy, ‚Äúsmall‚Äù people trip themselves up in small matters ‚Äî and pack their own emotions and insecurities (i.e., their identity) into the trivial.
And if that‚Äôs true, then:
Healthy couples don‚Äôt nitpick over small things.
Because problem, of course, is that small people don‚Äôt see this. They‚Äôve convinced themselves that these matters are big. Hence the importance of section 1 ‚Äî emotional health. And a healthy self-worth.
Note: just because ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù fights about something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs actually important. A lot of us distract ourselves with things that don‚Äôt actually matter ‚Äî in life, and in relationships ‚Äî and then get tangled up in a positive-feedback loop by pointing to ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù who‚Äôs doing the same thing.
Even if something bothers ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù (and your mom and best friend totally agree you were in the right), that doesn‚Äôt mean you should tie your insecurities up in it and make it into an ongoing thing.
Guys, chores are one of those things that just sort of have to happen in life. They are background to life ‚Äî not the end-all, be-all of anything. And they definitely should not occupy any serious headspace.
If you are honestly still fighting about the toothpaste, here‚Äôs a pro tip: buy two! This is what my partner and I did, because I‚Äôm the asshole who leaves the tip toothpaste-y and only loosely capped. So we each have our own tube, and it‚Äôs pure non-marital bliss. This ain‚Äôt hard.
Here‚Äôs something we all have to recognize and accept: two people will pretty much never have exactly the same standards of cleanliness. So to one person, the other will always be a slob. To the slob, the other will be a control freak. I have literally been both, depending on the relationship.
We all need to get over the fact that our partner isn‚Äôt going to mirror our exact viewpoint, both compromise and meet halfway, and move on.
(Or those leftovers you were totally saving. Or stealing a fry from your plate.) I‚Äôve heard people consider these deal-breakers, and to be honest I am truly astounded they‚Äôd break up over bagels or baÃÅnh miÃÄ. Like, ain‚Äôt no food worth more than a partner. (The heck is the matter with you people?)
One writer asked,
Honey... the ‚Äúbigger shit‚Äù ‚Äî what‚Äôs ‚Äúactually left to focus on‚Äù ‚Äî is life, man. It‚Äôs life.
It‚Äôs life, and it‚Äôs love. It‚Äôs growing as people, investing in our development, and supporting each other‚Äôs. It‚Äôs choosing work that excites us, whatever it is. It‚Äôs building something, both separately and together. It‚Äôs learning, experiencing, and being present ‚Äî in our own life and in theirs. It‚Äôs living.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs left‚Äù is: everything that actually matters:
...growth, adventure, critical thought, discussion, ideas, support, etc. Anything you want, really, based on good, healthy values ‚Äî which are always more than texts and toilet seats.
For the most part.
Because ‚Äúfighting‚Äù implies that you‚Äôre opponents ‚Äî but you‚Äôre on the same team! If either of you think in terms of ‚Äúwinner‚Äù and ‚Äúloser‚Äù... you‚Äôre both losing.
Of course there‚Äôs still going to be an occasional hiccup, but this isn‚Äôt a healthy default way of communicating.
Unhealthy: Come into conversations on the defense, guns ablazin‚Äô, fired up and hellbent on ‚Äúgetting their point across,‚Äù ‚Äúunloading,‚Äù or ‚Äúgetting heard.‚Äù
Healthy: Seeking to understand the other‚Äôs viewpoint, confident that their partner will do the same, and they communicate fairly when it‚Äôs time.
Healthy couples love. Each person cares for themselves, first and foremost, and they love each other ‚Äî as people. They understand their own needs and do the majority of the work in getting them met, which means they approach their partners warmly and openly, with space to understand and honor their needs as well. In healthy relationships, both people do this. So when disagreements do come up, they both have a solid emotional foundation to work through it in a healthy way.

Bonnie Barton|2.2K|8|https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-middle-aged-dudes-online-dating-guide-2305a07cdd6?source=tag_archive---------7---------------------|The Middle-Aged Dude‚Äôs Online Dating Guide ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"If you are 40ish (and beyond) and brand new to online dating, you are probably incapable of truly comprehending the depths of the insanity. You think you know. But this is one of those experiences that you cannot fully appreciate until you are immersed in it.
My hope is that this story answers some basics for those contemplating jumping into the increasingly murky online dating waters!
One of the reasons that online dating, in particular, is ridiculously confusing is that so few people (men and women) are honest. With themselves. And with others.
I would strongly recommend that you get very real with yourself and do some soul searching before you move forward with setting up an online/app dating profile.
Give serious consideration to what you have time for. How busy are you with your job, kids, ex, travel, hobbies? Are you really ready to jump in emotionally or is it too soon to be dating anyone seriously? Only interested in sex? Cool ‚Äî but BE HONEST!
Potential Catagories:
a) Only looking for sex (Casual sex or an official FWB)
Note: if you are catagory (a), toss up some shirtless selfies and/or other sexy photos, include your weight and height, and state that you are looking for ‚Äúfun/NSA/a hook-up.‚Äù You are done. The rest of my advice doesn‚Äôt apply to you. Except for the scammer info, be wary of them.
b) Just looking to text people because you aren‚Äôt really ready to meet anyone in person (There are a lot of these people out there, though I have yet to see this on anyone‚Äôs profile. Most of them are clueless rather than intentionally malicious and misleading.)
Note: if you are catagory (b), I‚Äôd recommend including decent photos and an abridged profile (for the practice, if nothing else). No problem in messaging/texting/talking to people, but you should come clean fairly soon so that you don‚Äôt waste their time.
It‚Äôs possible that you will eventually move on to (c-f), so I think it‚Äôs fine to be this option until you are ready to move to another catagory.
c) Just looking to meet people (Definitely do not want anything serious and have no plans of dating someone more than a handful of times, if that.)
d) Looking for friends (I‚Äôm not a fan of this approach, but some people like it.)
e) Looking for a short term relationship
f) Looking for a long term relationship
g) Unsure of what you are looking for
Note: I will cut you a bit of slack if you sincerely do not know what you want. Some folks have to meet/interact with people and actually experience online dating to get their heads around it. That‚Äôs fine, but you shouldn‚Äôt stay in (g) for long. Gain some knowledge, then make a determination on which catagory you are.
You don‚Äôt have to necessarily put anything in your profile, but should come clean with your intentions as quickly as possible. (Exception: if you are catagory (a), put that in your profile.)
I am unfailingly grateful when a guy writes that he is looking for an NSA. Or a ‚Äútourguide‚Äù while he‚Äôs in town for the weekend. Or a sub. Or a female bisexual unicorn to join him and his poly dominant partner for play when the moon is 5/6 full and the temperature is above 75 degrees.*
I would steer you to the always fabulous Niki Marinis‚Äô hilarious and truthful story as a starting point.
Unless you are an Adonis, the photos and profile are critical for increased success.
For your first photo, I recommend a 1/2 body CLEAR photo of you solo without sunglasses, baseball caps, or fish.
By all means, get more creative with the remaining photos, but be sure to always include: at least one smiling photo (yep, we are checking out your teeth ‚Äî you‚Äôd be surprised what‚Äôs out there), one full body shot, one photo without sunglasses on, one photo without a cap, and one more serious photo.
Consider including a photo of you in a suit, tux, or whatever your version of ‚Äúdressed up‚Äù is. Most women really do agree with ZZ Top. We love a sharp-dressed man!
If your photos are blurry, not current, contain photos of other women, and/or have children in every picture, I‚Äôm almost certainly going to swipe left. (If you do include women, please mention them in your profile so I have context. Otherwise: I‚Äôm not interested in guessing what that relationship is.)
Personally, if you have three or more people in the first couple of photos, you have already lost me. Too much work, too confusing. I‚Äôm swiping left. Period. A lot of guys make this mistake, please don‚Äôt be one of them.
As Niki mentions, please spend some time to fill out the profile! You don‚Äôt have to be clever just honest and sincere. Of course, the more interesting, charming, and unique you make it, the better your chance of success will be.
Have a cool hobby? Travel somewhere special? Make a mean steak? Use these to your advantage so that you can stand out in a sea of other guys.
A word about height: I acknowledge that it sucks for guys who aren‚Äôt tall! I‚Äôve dated guys from 5'5"" to 6'5"", but many women won‚Äôt look at guys under 6'.
I‚Äôm sorry about that, but go ahead and include your ACTUAL height. Do not make a snarky comment about it and don‚Äôt add 2 inches, just include it in your info matter-of-factly. If a woman passes on you, that‚Äôs her loss. Best to be honest and move along.
I find that most people think they have low enough expectations, but often they end up disappointed. So, yes, most of you will need to lower your expectations even more.
Having said that, if you are decent looking, reasonably in shape or funny or intelligent or charming (or some combination), financially stable, and not trying to date super hot 25 year olds, you should be able to find some awesome chicks.
You are also VERY likely to encounter: emotionally unavailable women, women with walls, women who are going to get wasted a lot (might be fine if you are just looking for some fun sex), confusing women, confused women, women who use sex to get back at an ex, dramatic women, dishonest women.
In fact, let me flesh out what ‚Äúdishonest‚Äù tends to look like for women based on the stories I‚Äôve heard from the guys I have dated/my male friends:
Weight (very common), number of kids (really), age, drug use, ex drama, and/or solely looking for a free meal (more common with younger women).
My tongue-in-cheek attempt at addressing the types of women you are likely to see:
The scammer situation: Yes, that remains a problem, especially for guys. If a woman is too hot, too quick to send photos, inclined to use awkward English (‚Äúfood stuffs‚Äù anyone?), and seems to never be in the hometown she says she‚Äôs from, you‚Äôve probably got a scammer.
Two of the telltale signs are sending you scantily-clad photos immediately and being on vacation/out of town for work. She‚Äôs going to ask you for money to get back home, to visit you, or for a new phone so she can send you even more provocative photos. Walk away.
For me, it is. Even with all the mean dudes, flakes, and users, I wouldn‚Äôt date at all if it weren‚Äôt for online dating.
I have met some very special guys on Bumble/Match/OKCupid. Although my track record is poor, online dating sites/apps gave me two very dear friends, a serious beau, and the opportunity to meet some pretty great guys.
Not everyone out there is a disaster!
One of my close straight guy pals regularly dates online and has had a fair amount of success (and many disappointments, too, of course).
Don‚Äôt sit on the sidelines. Be interesting in your correspondence instead of lazy and predictable. Put yourself out there. Take risks. Be open-minded (and realistic) about potential dates.
When you make a connection, ask her out! See if she‚Äôs really ready to meet you or not. Be direct and try to lock down a meeting time and place. If she demurs, give her a second chance. If she‚Äôs still putting you off, move along.
~Bring your sense of humor and thickest skin at all times! Don‚Äôt take the process any more seriously than necessary.
~Expect weird/bizarre/annoying/even hurtful things to happen as part of the process.
~Yes, you are going to get ghosted, ignored, the run-around, and an array of other alarming behaviors. Most of us do our best to avoid them, but you cannot always tell who is going to suddenly flake out or get weird or become defensive. Be prepared and navigate it as best as you can.

Kris Gage|6.7K|4|https://medium.com/@krisgage/non-attachment-does-not-contradict-love-c7d7fb47803b?source=tag_archive---------8---------------------|Non-Attachment Does Not Contradict Love ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"I write a lot about the importance of non-attachment.
Not, to be clear, of being ‚Äúunattached‚Äù (or ‚Äúlove avoidant‚Äù), because the difference between these two and ‚Äúnon-attachment,‚Äù though seemingly small, means the difference between emotional health and turmoil.
Non-attachment, as I‚Äôve said, is about respecting ourselves and others as individuals. It is coexisting and extending compassion to others without simultaneously pulling, tugging, demanding, or clinging. (And it‚Äôs also about not letting ourselves be mistreated, as the first step to real love is self-love ‚Äî not selfishness, but self-respect and self-compassion; i.e., extending ourselves the same mature and healthy consideration we extend others.)
All of this is different than ‚Äúunattached,‚Äù avoidant, dismissive, etc. It is still warm. It‚Äôs just not flailing.
This is directly related to understanding what we do and do not control ‚Äî that being: we only control ourselves and our responses; we do not control others or the universe; we cannot keep change from happening, but we can control how we react.
But neither of these, to be clear, contradict love.
In fact, on the contrary, they are love.
The difference is: it‚Äôs healthy love.
It would seem that I‚Äôm talking about ‚Äúsuppressing emotions‚Äù and ‚Äúkeeping people and things at arm‚Äôs length,‚Äù but I‚Äôm not.
Joy is still important.
Both the Stoics and Buddhists alike agree:
The difference is that when we talk about ‚Äújoy‚Äù in this way, we are not talking about emotional recklessness. We are not talking about escape or hedonism or hiding our shortcomings and fears in others, tucking them down into ‚Äúrelationships.‚Äù
Good joy ‚Äî and good love ‚Äî is self-fostered. It is not dependent on others, or the universe. It is ours. And when we allow ourselves (and recognize our) agency over our own joy, we permit ourselves a degree of health and happiness that can‚Äôt even be comprehended by those who don‚Äôt.
All of life‚Äôs (and major religions and philosophies) messaging come down to pretty consistent principles.
Stoicism, for example, commends: practical wisdom (the ability to navigate complex situations in the best way possible), courage (to do the right thing), justice (so that we know what the right is), and temperance (doing everything in reasonable measure, not too much nor too little.) Following this makes a person happier, healthier ‚Äî better, as it is. And you can see the easy translation from the broad and general to the realm of love, specifically.
Buddhism commends four boundless qualities, which literally have ‚Äúno measure.‚Äù They are equanimity, compassion, joy, and, yes, explicitly: love.
They, too, account for love ‚Äî even as they simultaneously value non-attachment. Because to be non-attached is not to be distant. It is simple to honor each other, without ownership, demands, or claims.
It has to do with understanding what we do and do not control:
Many of the behaviors and suffering that we assume are a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù part of love (from jealousy to infidelity to heartbreak) can be avoided. They are not an innate part of mature, healthy love.
What we all really want is ease and happiness and warmth.
And so,
And, as Massimo Pigliucci wrote, we can:
We can have more, not less, love ‚Äî and we can be happier, not less happy ‚Äî but establishing ‚Äúlove‚Äù within the framework and on the foundation of non-attachment.
Because by relinquishing our ‚Äúattachment‚Äù ‚Äî demands, ownership, poor emotional boundaries, codependency, etc. ‚Äî we open ourselves up to loving in a truly healthy and mature manner, which opens love up to something even more beautiful.

Aaron Zhu|6K|4|https://psiloveyou.xyz/what-my-short-term-relationships-taught-me-about-love-and-life-e36db2dee088?source=tag_archive---------9---------------------|What my short-term relationships taught me about love and life|"When it comes to love and relationships, it seems that everything is learned the hard way. It‚Äôs not taught in school (even though it‚Äôs one of the most important subjects in life) and even if it was, it would be a double-edged sword because there really isn‚Äôt a right or wrong way to love, the best you can do is love as much as you can and learn through your experiences.
At this point, my romantic encounters are vaguely reminiscent of Taylor Swift‚Äôs, in that they come in short bursts and end in scorn that is used to fuel other facets of life. It isn‚Äôt what I planned, but at least having commonalities with Taylor Swift is pretty cool (silver linings right?) All in all, you can say that I‚Äôve taken many crash courses in love and relationships, here are five lessons that I learned:
People come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime. As cynical as it sounds, it‚Äôs true and I‚Äôd like to take it even further; relationships can only end in two ways, separation or death. There is no forever, I‚Äôve been promised forever by so many exes that it‚Äôs as meaningless to me as a homeless person promising me a pot of gold. From here on out, I‚Äôm no longer looking for promises of forever, what I want is the promise that you‚Äôll try your best and you‚Äôll be worth it. Don‚Äôt promise me forever, promise me that there will be no regrets.
Happiness is fully dependent on yourself; other people can‚Äôt make you happy. What this means is that if you‚Äôre not happy going into a relationship, you won‚Äôt be happy while you‚Äôre in it. I‚Äôve experienced the highs of finding a relationship that I thought would pull me out of depression, but guess what? The second it ended, my depression came right back, it‚Äôs something you must conquer on your own. On the contrary, I‚Äôve also gone into relationships as a truly happy person and the rule still remained true. I went in happy, I came out happy, the ending was sad and it hurt, but deep down, I was still happy. Hence, don‚Äôt look for happiness in others; it can only be found within yourself. Look to others to enhance the happiness you already have.
Whoever your partner was before they met you, that is who they‚Äôre going to be the whole way. So if there is a fundamental personality trait in your partner that rubs you the wrong way, don‚Äôt wait around hoping things will change, because they won‚Äôt. That‚Äôs who they are, either find a way to love and accept it or leave. I‚Äôve clung to a relationship with someone who was practically a physical manifestation of pessimism thinking they were just going through a bad patch and that things would eventually change. However, you can‚Äôt change the fundamentals of who someone is, that is a choice they have to make for themselves. Sometimes, it‚Äôs best to love someone from afar because incompatibility exists and the person you love may not be the person you can be happy with at that time.
Managing your expectations is such an important factor in preserving your happiness and most people forget this when they fall in love. There‚Äôs no one to blame for this because alas, love is blind. But, we live, experience and learn. Relationships will teach you that humans are and always will be just humans, meaning that anything is possible. You can be completely in love with someone, having the best time of your life, and it can end in a second. You and your partner could have had an amazing date, and they may decide to end the relationship the next day. The person who you completely trust could betray you at any moment (even Beyonce got cheated on multiple times, go figure). If you want to spare yourself a lot of pain and sorrow, remind yourself that these scenarios are all possible. I believe that trust and having confidence in another person is necessary to sustain a relationship. But at the end of the day, this is life and anything goes. The world doesn‚Äôt believe in mercy; it‚Äôll throw anything and everything at you whether you‚Äôre ready or not. Therefore, you must manage your expectations and appreciate the moments in life while you are still in them.
Self-improvement and care is never selfish. The fact of the matter is, the best thing you can do for your relationship is to improve yourself because the better you are, the better your relationship can be. Relationships stagnate and decay because one or both individuals lose interest in their personal development. Dating an unambitious person taught me that without a passion for life, dreams, and goals, excitement and communication dries out very quickly. When there‚Äôs nothing going on, there‚Äôs nothing to talk about and without communication, emotional connection dwindles. Furthermore, if the relationship does end, only you will be around to pick up the pieces, so don‚Äôt ever lose yourself. Always remember who you are, what you need, and don‚Äôt ever stop serving yourself.

Vishal Kataria|330|6|https://theascent.pub/this-simple-action-is-all-it-takes-to-stick-to-your-goals-b31aba051cdd?source=---------0---------------------|This Simple Action is All it Takes to Stick to Your Goals|"The demand for online courses industry has shot through the roof.
In 2015, the global market for such courses reached $107 billion. Just two years later, the market grew to $255 billion ‚Äî a whopping 238 percent growth within 2 years!
But there‚Äôs something more. And it‚Äôs not good.
A study revealed that the average completion for Massive Open Online Courses ‚Äî MOOCs ‚Äî is a dismal fifteen percent.
I‚Äôll admit. I‚Äôm part of the 85 percent. Barring a couple, almost every online course I‚Äôve signed up for has stalled at the halfway stage.
It‚Äôs not just online courses that lie unfinished. College degrees, novels, paintings, songs, projects... every day millions of goals get abandoned.
Nobody begins pursuing their goals with the idea of giving up. When people start something new, it feels amazing. They feel a surge of energy as they begin to shape their vision.
But as the work gets tougher, their effort declines for various reasons ‚Äî new responsibilities, lack of time, too hard, ‚Äújust can‚Äôt do this right now.‚Äù All these reasons boil down to one thing ‚Äî aversion against discomfort.
People value their comfort zone more than anything else, even money. That‚Äôs why many of us enroll for courses that we don‚Äôt complete, rent studios to do work that we never finish, and hire consultants and coaches to help us set goals that we never pursue.
Everyone loves thinking about the outcome. What it will look like, how we will feel AFTER we‚Äôve achieved it. Daydreaming doesn‚Äôt demand much. If anything, it keeps us in our comfort zone.
But taking action TO achieve the goal pushes us outside our comfort zone. And that‚Äôs one thing we don‚Äôt want to compromise on at all.
We want to get fitter, but we don‚Äôt want to exercise.
We want to save money, but we don‚Äôt want to change our spending habits.
We want to write a book, but we don‚Äôt want to sit down at the table, think, and put the words on paper (or a document).
When you set a goal but leave it midway, you do yourself more harm than good.
For example, each time you lose momentum, you have to work twice as hard to get back to your original rhythm. This Sisyphean feeling takes all the fun out of doing something for the love of it instead of love for the outcome.
Also, the vast chasm of feelings between the vicarious joy you experienced when you imagined the goal achieved and the secret disappointment you felt when you gave up make you feel like shit (and guilty).
And you try to suppress this feeling of guilt and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good for nothing‚Äù by consuming more content, eating more junk food, wasting more time, and blaming the world for your condition.
Look. If blaming the world helped people achieve their results, everyone would do it.
Okay, almost everyone does it, but because it makes them feel better in the present moment. In the long run, it‚Äôs as destructive as exposing yourself to outrages on social media every day.
Do your future self a favor: Stop complaining and start doing just one key thing to stick to what matters.
The journey to a thousand miles starts with a single step. But you cannot reach the destination if you stop after ten steps.
On the other hand, continuing your journey doesn‚Äôt demand that you turn into a superhero. It just demands that you take one step at a time.
Not so tough, is it?
You don‚Äôt need extreme self-discipline. You don‚Äôt have to hole yourself up in the Batcave for ten hours a day. You don‚Äôt have to give up on everything you enjoy.
You just have to show up every day. You just need enough self-discipline to stick to your average pace.
Your average pace, according to James Clear, is what pushes you enough to make progress, but not so much that it becomes unsustainable.
Here are some examples.
If you exercise thrice a week, you‚Äôll have exercised 72 times at the end of six months.
If you put 100 bucks in a cookie jar each day, you‚Äôll have saved 18,000 bucks at the end of six months, which you can invest in a mutual fund.
If you write one page for your book each day, you‚Äôll complete 180 pages at the end of six months.
As you can see, your average pace will produce long-term results that will make you feel proud of yourself.
Sticking to your average pace also has a hidden advantage It turns these actions into habits which, in turn, increase your average pace. And once you learn to stretch your limits in one aspect of life, you begin to apply it in every other aspect.
Simple question, simple answer.
When you want to buy a new mobile phone, you have two options for action.
One, you can gather mounds of information from friends and the internet, wait to check whether the rumors about new model launches are true, and drag your feet.
But that‚Äôs not what you do, is it? You often follow the second option, which is:
Follow the same regime for your actions.
Read up about steps to begin what you want to. Then go on a content-fast: stop consuming content and start taking action. Keep the chain going. If you don‚Äôt show up for two days in a row, make sure you don‚Äôt miss the third.
When you hit a wall, get information on it, go on a content-fast, and take action.
Rinse, repeat.
I‚Äôll admit, doing so requires courage.
To hit the gym when you would rather veg out on the sofa and watch Netflix.
To save up when you would rather buy the latest smartphone model because your six-month-old phone feels outdated.
To write your book when your friends ask you to join them for Friday-evening parties.
To be called primitive for missing a few episodes of Game of Thrones because you were working on your goal.
But think about Future You. What will Future You thank you for one year, two years, five years down the line? For not compromising on your comfort zone? Or for showing up every day to do what you promised yourself you would?
Consistency matures you. It‚Äôs the best investment you can make in yourself.
Move ahead, one step at a time, one day at a time. Gain a yard each day.
A yard seems tiny now, but at the end of six months, you‚Äôll have crossed the football field.

Louis Grenier|27K|11|https://medium.com/the-mission/seth-godin-new-business-5-step-fdb354988c23?source=---------1---------------------|How Seth Godin Would Launch a New Business With $1,000 And 90 Days to Spare|"Most of the so-called marketing ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù out there are celebrities.
They‚Äôve made it.
They‚Äôre not in the trenches anymore.
They forgot how to ‚Äúdo‚Äù marketing; their employees promote their new books for them, build their new websites, launch their new products... all they have to do is sign their name under whatever new projects and Ka Ching! the money starts rolling in their bank accounts.
That‚Äôs what I thought when I was preparing my interview with Seth Godin for my podcast called Everyone Hates Marketers (how I managed to get him on the show is another story).
Seth has published 18 books, is regarded as one the best marketing minds alongside Ogilvy or Tim Ferriss, so he doesn‚Äôt need to be in the trenches anymore.
I chose to challenge him to take him out of his comfort zone and see if he still ‚Äúgot it‚Äù.
I asked him to:
There was one catch though: he couldn‚Äôt use his name to promote it, he had only a budget of $1,000, and 90 days to be successful.
What follows is the exact 5-step process Seth Godin uses to launch a new business (from scratch) with only $1,000 in the bank and 90 days to spare.
The time of scammy, in-your-face marketing is over.
20 years ago, you could come up with an average product, invest a few thousand euros in TV Ads saying that your product was the best ever, and sell 10,000 units of it.
Not anymore.
People are immune to bad marketing.
Don‚Äôt believe me?
When was the last time you bought SEO services from a cold email? When was the last time you subscribed to a new marketing software from an automated direct message on Twitter?
That‚Äôs right: never.
We expect to sell using those shady techniques, yet we HATE it when it happens to us.
The first step towards a launching a new business according to Seth Godin is to change your mindset. You can‚Äôt come up with a product or service and THEN decide to market it.
You have to involve people in the process.
Your customers are humans just like you.
They‚Äôre not just a number on Google Analytics.
Treat them as such.
In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg launched a social network for Harvard students only.
Look where Facebook is now.
In 1970, Yvon Chouinard (left), co-Founder of Patagonia, was selling ‚Äúhomemade gear out of the back of his car, supplementing his income by diving into trash cans and redeeming bottles for cash‚Äù.
Patagonia is now worth $209M.
I had the same dilemma when I started my podcast Everyone Hates Marketers. I wanted to reach ALL the marketers on the planet.
I realized that I would stretch myself too thin if I was going down this road.
So I trimmed my audience to the bone: I would focus only on digital marketers working in tech who are sick of shady, aggressive marketing.
This was the audience I knew the best: I am a tech marketer sick of shady, aggressive marketing.
By focusing on this small audience I have an edge over the generalist digital marketing podcasts out there.
I can address their biggest, most specific pains. This is what remarkable marketing is all about.
This probably goes against everything you learned about business. That‚Äôs because this is the ugly, unsexy part.
No, you‚Äôre not going to become a millionaire this year, or even next year. It might take 9 years, 18 years, 25 years, who knows?
So, how do you pick a tiny audience?
This part takes discipline.
You probably have an idea of a product or service you want to offer; now it‚Äôs time to select the bullseye: who are the people who will benefit the most from using your product or service?
When I asked Seth Godin to come up with a business idea on the fly, he came up with a concierge service to help tourists find an Airbnb in Paris.
But ‚Äútourists‚Äù could be anybody: are we serving a Japanese family looking to go to Versailles for the first time or a Brazilian businessman who want a place to stay near Bercy for a seminar?
So, Seth trimmed down his audience: he would help Californian families with young kids to find the best place to stay in Paris for their holidays.
This is much more specific, and, all of a sudden, the problems they face and the solutions we can offer become much more specific, too.
Californian families want high-speed internet to talk with their relatives who stayed in San Diego. They want to see the Eiffel Tower from their balcony just like in the movies. They want to taste the best croissants Paris has to offer since they can‚Äôt find any in San Diego.
See what I mean?
You might fear that the audience you‚Äôre thinking of is too small.
Here‚Äôs a tip I got from Philip Morgan (an expert in marketing positioning): if there‚Äôs a conference especially organized for it, then your audience is big enough.
For example, did you know that there‚Äôs a conference for handcrafted soap makers?
The next one is in Atlanta, Georgia, and 450 attendees are expected. If the handcrafted soap maker conference organizers managed to make money from such a tiny audience, so can you!
Ok, ok, this might sound clicheÃÅ but hear me out first.
Remarkable marketing starts with a remarkable product.
But, what‚Äôs a remarkable product you ask?
It‚Äôs a product that your customers simply CAN‚ÄôT live without; they love it so much that they tell their friends, who tell their friends, who tell their friends.
You get the drill.
The problem is that most of us try to sell average products to average people.
Because the products are average, customers are not raving about them.
They don‚Äôt talk about them to their friends.
As a consequence, we have to use shady, aggressive marketing to compensate for the loss in business.
Do you think Slack had to use in-your-face marketing to sell their product?
Nope.
Anybody can use their product for free ‚Äî there is no string attached. The product is so good that it IS their marketing. They went from 16,000 Daily Active Users to 2.7 Million in 2 years.
As Seth Godin mentioned in the episode: did you start using Facebook because you saw their ads on a lifestyle magazine? Nope. Your friends told you about it.
Have you heard of MailChimp because they sponsored a conference you went to?
Nope.
Their email tool was so good that you started to receive newsletters from businesses and people you knew, sent from MailChimp. You checked out their site, tried their email software for free, and loved the experience.
Now here‚Äôs the hard truth: you‚Äôre not going to launch the next Facebook, MailChimp, or Slack.
They‚Äôre solving big problems for millions of people.
But, to start with, you can create a remarkable product for a small audience.
It‚Äôs time to get out of the building and talk to people:
This is why Hotjar, the all-in-one analytics and feedback solution for your website, wanted to build a remarkable product.
It took them only 4 weeks to come up with the first version of the product, built a very simple landing page, let 1,500 people use it straight away, and gathered feedback.
The product was so good that those 1,500 early adopters referred an additional 17,500 people in less than a month. At this point, the Hotjar co-founders knew they had a winner.
There is no silver bullet in building a remarkable product and it might take you months or even years to find the right recipe, but, if you start with a small audience and gather feedback on the way, your chance of coming up with a remarkable product or service will get much, much, higher.
How do you get the word out about your product or service if you have only $1,000 in the bank?
Let‚Äôs get back to the example mentioned earlier: a concierge service for Californian families who want to get to Paris on holidays and find a place to stay.
To get the word out, Seth proposes to select the best 50 Airbnbs in Paris, take pictures, and create an amazing 50-page guide of where our potential customers should stay when going to Paris.
This guide would be available for free, on Medium, for everybody to see.
He would then contact 10 people he knows who fit the description of his ideal audience and see if they get any value out of it.
If they do, they‚Äôre probably going to share this guide to their friends, who will then share it with their friends and so on...
If they don‚Äôt, he would improve the guide until they do.
Here‚Äôs the catch: he would leave his email address at the bottom of the guide, and expect readers to contact with questions.
He‚Äôd give great free advice, engaging with 100 to 1000 people a day back and forth, back and forth, until he‚Äôd the indispensable middle man.
Airbnb owners would pay him to write a review about their place, while American families will reach out to find the best Airbnb apartment in the city center of Paris for less than 250$ a night.
This concept can be applied to any type of products to services: to be trusted you must first give value for free.
This requires patience.
At the end of 2016, Unbounce, a landing page software, had more than 16,000 paying customers.
How did they get there?
They started blogging six months before their first product release (in 2010), but, what really helped them to become the most popular landing page software on the planet, was a guest post on Moz.com called ‚ÄúThe Noob Guide to Online Marketing‚Äù; a giant guide and infographic containing TONS of value.
They turned this post into an ebook which got downloaded 150,000 times.
Unbounce got trusted as the go-to online marketing experts, and the rest is history.
Can YOU do the same in your niche?
You might feel overwhelmed by all of the above, and that‚Äôs ok.
You might not know where to focus on: there are so many things you could do, so many channels you could use, so many ideas running in your head.
How do you choose which project to focus on first?
Simple.
Do a thing and stick to it.
I used to act like a headless chicken when I started my career: I was impatient, switching from one project to another in a blink of an eye.
7 years ago, I launched a blog about marketing (in French), wrote 9 articles, and stopped because there weren‚Äôt enough people reading them.
4 years ago, I wanted to create a community for cystic fibrosis patients to connect with each other (my younger brother has cystic fibrosis). I pitched the idea at a Startup Weekend, worked on it for two weeks, and quit.
It is when I started interviewing no-nonsense marketers a few months that I had an epiphany: every one of my guests, in their own words, mentioned the virtue of tranquility.
I stopped checking my mentions on Twitter every 30 minutes, I stopped checking my website stats on Google Analytics every day, I stopped looking at my podcast downloads every Tuesday (when I publish a new episode on Everyone Hates Marketers).
Instead, I‚Äôve decided to make a spinner and spin the wheel. I‚Äôve decided to deliver value every week and to stop expecting success to knock on my door tomorrow.
I know that success will come; I just don‚Äôt know when.
It‚Äôs such a liberating feeling.
Success is a byproduct of helping people solve their biggest most painful problems.

I met Enio in August 2016 through mutual friends during a whisky tasting. We quickly found common topics and started discussions about artificial intelligence and bars ‚Äî he was running 6. cocktails at the time, definitely one of the best speak-easy bars in Warsaw, and I had a crazy idea of actually starting a bar, which Enio persuaded me not to do (thanks!). We started meeting more often and discussing different ideas around start-ups and artificial intelligence.
Finally Enio came to me in February 2017 with a well-formed idea. He wanted to create a quick delivery company, which could buy and bring you anything within 60 minutes in Warsaw (and then in other cities too). Something between Uber and DHL/UPS. It immediately sparked my attention as just before this meeting I was reading about a similar start-up in Bangalore, India. What a coincidence! Enio asked whether I wanted to be his business partner in this venture. I took a moment and said ‚Äòyes, but...‚Äô I had bad experiences trying to set up my own business just a couple of months ago and basically losing my team to a different idea, so I wasn‚Äôt super-optimistic about going into yet another venture. I basically said that I‚Äôm in, but I want to have 10% equity and be focused only on the technological side of the venture. We shaked hands and decided to give it a shot!
I didn‚Äôt know what I was going into. At that time I was doing some consulting projects, writing books and was involved in plethora of activities. One by one I had to cut them, so that in October 2017 we could be in full swing. Soon it happened that I wasn‚Äôt only dealing with the technological side, but was discussing with Enio every single bit of the business, calculating risks, costs and opportunities. This started to interfere with my other duties sooner that I have expected.
Lesson 1: Write down who‚Äôs responsible for what. Just a rough draft is fine, but have it and keep it. This is particularly helpful when there‚Äôs a discrepancy in equity among co-founders and some of co-founders are engaged in other projects.
We didn‚Äôt investigate enough before the start why there is no business like ours in Warsaw so far. There is a strategy, which we have learned later at Google Campus, of asking 5 times why. You keep banging your head against the same wall until you finally get the answer. Five times is usually enough to get to the essence. The one question we should have started with is to really understand why there was no business like Bring ‚Äî there were plethora of couriers, there was Uber, but somehow Uber Rush was closed and there was no single major player in this part of Europe (competitors included Glovo in Western Europe and Postmates in North America). It seemed hard to get a scale. We didn‚Äôt think about it much. We did some computations about our business model ‚Äî how many drivers we might need, how many consultants to operate between clients and drivers and how our software should look like.
On paper it looked good. We assumed one driver can do one task per hour, which happened to be fairly accurate. We assumed we need one consultant per 5 drivers, which also turned out to be fine. What didn‚Äôt work was the payroll ‚Äî we underestimated costs and salaries. Margins are really low in logistics! Regarding the software we‚Äôve decided to go with one software house and that was a great idea. They built everything we wanted.
The following Q&A is cheated in the sense that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to answer this well to all these ‚Äòwhy‚Äô questions before failing. It‚Äôs only because we‚Äôve made all these errors that I‚Äôm able to have this conversation. However when we did a similar exercise at Campus Warsaw a couple of months ago, it already showed us a similar pattern ‚Äî this business is hard to do!
Lesson 2: Ask yourself ‚Äòwhy‚Äô at least 5 times, each time going deeper into why you are running this particular business.
We officially registered Bring in May 2017, after having prepared a draft of a business plan (we thought!), legal documents and initial idea what to do next. We started by imagining how our application should be built and what components would go inside. At the same time we were talking with different software houses to get to know more about the possible pricing and it turned out that doing a Facebook Messenger app would save us a lot. We analysed and decided to go for it ‚Äî not only we were saving money, bootstrapping on our own capital, but it seemed like a cool idea. We had in mind WeChat, a Chinese communicator which is widely used for all kind of services. Definitely Facebook was lagging behind, but that was an advantage ‚Äî who wants to download yet another app?!
We have chosen a software house, which happened to be absolutely great, and after a couple of meetings they‚Äôve started working on our app while we were researching payment solutions and more of legal stuff. It turned out to take a bit longer than we thought, but still we were able to have a working MVP by October 2017. There were some bugs to be fixed, but the whole concept was there and we were ready to set a launch date ‚Äî 29th November 2017. Enio went to Mexico for a break in November and when he got back, we were ready to launch. We resigned from doing a large marketing campaign, because we were scared that demand for Bring would much outdo our capabilities. I should add that at this point we have hired one driver for a full-time job and another one was waiting once we‚Äôd confirm demand.
Even though Bring.ai had .ai in its name, at this stage we didn‚Äôt have much machine learning inside. Our ordering process was going to be automated but for now we needed someone to take care of our customers: reply to what their write on Facebook Messenger, pass their orders to drivers and supervise the whole process. Enio posted a job offer on different Facebook groups and soon we had a couple of candidates. Soon we had our first meetings with potential candidates and we quickly decided to take on board Karina, a friend of Enio, who was very motivated from the start and turned out to be the best choice ever. She single-handedly has taken on our customer relations and fleet management, putting in 12-hours workdays! Her commitment was amazing, even though she wasn‚Äôt one of the founders. For me that was a lesson in understanding that different people are motivated by different things.
Lesson 3: Hire motivated people who fit your venture‚Äôs culture!
We were thrilled. I couldn‚Äôt sleep much before the launch date set on 29th November 2017. We were to start at 9am, we have informed some of our friends before, but the main campaign was to be started at 9am. Our driver was waiting, our coders were ready to fix any bugs and Karina was on Facebook waiting for first orders. We have also prepared a campaign with free orders for our friends and influencers. Time was ticking. 8.50am. 8.55am. 9.00am. Here we go! The campaign starts, we‚Äôre all over social media and... 9.05am. Nothing. 9.10am. Nothing. Apparently our friends weren‚Äôt waiting in lines to use Bring the first thing in the morning. The time went on and during the first day we have done a couple of orders in total. Not really what we were expecting but we weren‚Äôt discouraged.
Next days were similar, our campaign didn‚Äôt bring us much orders and we started thinking what‚Äôs wrong. We decided to do more marketing, paid campaigns, articles and asked friends to like our Facebook fanpage. Slowly we have started to grow to reach an average of 10 orders per day after the first month. Not bad. That went well with our assumptions. We were expecting to achieve 15 orders per day by the next month, but we ended up with an average of 12. A bit worse, but that showed progress. In the third month we grew to around 15 orders per day. We saw a growth, smaller than we wanted, but still a growth, and that‚Äôs a good thing, right?
Actually no ‚Äî we were growing too slowly and we convinced ourselves that it is temporary, that our hockey stick growth is just around the corner, we just need a little bit more time and capital. We put that in our pitchdeck for investors and started pitching. We got positive feedback, some talks went on. In the meantime we got admitted into Google Residency Program at Campus Warsaw, we got some publicity. We were clearly on fire! Our expectations of how we want to grow and what capital we want to raise were growing. From 1 mln zl we went to $1 mln, tripling initial amount. We thought that‚Äôs how good we are. We weren‚Äôt. We were early in the game and we had still a lot to prove in order to support our claims. Raising our valuation in the middle of the process resulted in one obvious thing: we didn‚Äôt get any investor. We were by ourselves, which was still fine, but we had 6 months until a burnout. We needed to turn the situation around!
Lesson 4: Don‚Äôt be greedy! Stay humble and question your results.
We were pretty attached to our equity. We didn‚Äôt thought about taking more people on board and sharing equity with them. This was clearly a mistake as it became apparent that we lack skills to make it happen. We especially lacked sales and marketing skills to start selling our product and becoming visible everywhere in Warsaw.
We badly needed someone who would do all the cold-calling, go to different offices and advertise Bring and get for us larger deals with businesses. We also needed to brand our drivers, use flyers and more advertising to become visible. However we said to ourselves that we don‚Äôt have capital to hire people and we can do that ourselves. The first part was true, we didn‚Äôt have cash for it, but it was a mere excuse ‚Äî we could either raise some smaller money just to meet this particular goal, or we could bring on board someone with the right expertise as a partner. We were reluctant to do that, because for some time everything seemed to be going great as in the first three months we had a growth of 30% per month (from November 2017 to February 2018). However we ended within the range of 10‚Äì20 tasks per day and we couldn‚Äôt get past it. We haven‚Äôt got past it after 6 months, that number stayed with us till the end. After fourth-fifth month, in April 2018 definitely, we already knew that something isn‚Äôt working, but we were too afraid to sit down, analyse causes, and act upon them. We started to swim adrift, doing what we were doing before, but clearly losing energy with each month, as there was no change in sight, and with passing time it was harder and harder to make one. We weren‚Äôt brave enough to look into the potential failure and make drastic changes while we still could. In April 2018 we still had at least 6 months before burnout ‚Äî enough to start changing how we operated, take upon new people, new perspective and new money. Later on that went from hard to impossible. We didn‚Äôt secure any investments, we were on our own with no advisors and slowly burning out. By inertia we were drifting towards a failure.
Lesson 5: Write down what kind of capabilities and skills you need in your adventure. Don‚Äôt be too attached to equity at the beginning ‚Äî 90% of 0 is still 0. Use equity to bring on board people and necessary capital. You can do multiple (pre-)seed rounds.
When everything is on fire, you should have an exit plan. We didn‚Äôt. We started thinking about selling the company when it was too late to close the deal and that solution was the last chance, we thought, to do something with Bring. We didn‚Äôt prepare for it, even though it was clear starting from May 2018, that it might happen. Thinking about selling would be a good exercise at that point, as it would clearly show what we are worth.
Having an exit plan also means that you know when to end your venture. If things are going great you might want to make a successful exit to a large enterprise. If it‚Äôs a downhill ride, you might at least save some IP, package it into a useful product and sell part of your company, minimizing loses (read Ben Horowitz‚Äôs story in The Hard Thing About Hard Things). Or if you‚Äôre just making loses, decide on a deadline ‚Äî when will you close your business if nothing changes. Coming up with an exit plan is a refreshing exercise ‚Äî it allows you to take a step back and reflect upon what‚Äôs valuable in your venture, what might be the outcome of your decisions, but more importantly what you should do next! If you know that you have 6 months until the end, and going with the pace you‚Äôre going won‚Äôt bring change, you have to become sharp and decide quickly on the next steps. Clock is ticking. Especially in start-ups time is a very limited asset, that you better not waste in vain. Act!
The above paragraph is a letter I should send myself in May 2018. We didn‚Äôt ask ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù enough. What if we fail? What if we run out of cash? What if we don‚Äôt find investors? What if...
Lesson 6: Analyse possible future scenarios and act now! Don‚Äôt wait. There is never a perfect timing.
On the last day of September 2018 we closed all operations of Bring. That was it. We failed. We summarized what we had and closed the venture. Was it a lost time? Of course not. I loved the whole journey with all its bumps. I could do it much better if I were to start it from scratch right now, but I didn‚Äôt have the knowledge I have right now. I don‚Äôt think you can actually learn business unless you actually run a business. Starting a venture is the best way to learn. I view my 1.5 year journey with Bring as an equivalent of getting an MBA. It was extremely valuable and I see benefits of it coming over and over in small decisions I make in my current projects. But that‚Äôs a different story.
I‚Äôm grateful to Enio for initiating the whole adventure and being in this to the very end. We had many amazing discussions along the way and many brainstorming sessions in which we were trying to overturn the odds. Failing isn‚Äôt pleasant, but the experience I‚Äôve got this way is invaluable. I have learned a lot about intricacies of running a business: what is really important, what to ignore, what kind of questions to ask, what to analyse. Nevertheless that‚Äôs still merely a beginning of a never-ending story of entrepreneurship. New challenges await!
Lesson 7: Don‚Äôt read about the business, do it!

Every afternoon, she quizzed me on my identity. I was eight.
After a week of futile efforts, she gave up.
We never talked about it again. My failure to describe myself became just one more disappointment.
Self discovery. The journey inside. Uncovering your identity. And other bullshit. We‚Äôve all heard someone talk like this before. Maybe a few. They‚Äôre going to travel the world.
Get in touch with themselves.
That‚Äôs great. Sure, you can probably learn more about yourself by spending some time in another city.
Breaking out of your comfort zone.
Spending some time in quiet reflection.
But you can do that anywhere. Your identity ‚Äî whatever you think that is ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt live in the mountains. Or the beach. You can‚Äôt buy it for $29.95. And you definitely won‚Äôt discover it at an airport bookstore.
You‚Äôre not going to walk up to yourself at a resort, or some yoga retreat, and make an introduction. You‚Äôre right here. Granted, it‚Äôs hard to put yourself into words. Here‚Äôs the thing: Who says you need to?
A lot of us have fallen into the profile trap. Apps like Tinder and Facebook want us to write engaging descriptions of ourselves. But you‚Äôre not a clever sentence. Or even a paragraph.
We can leave clues about our identities, but that‚Äôs it.
We‚Äôre always evolving. That makes it hard to pin ourselves down. You don‚Äôt even know how much your personality changes from one year to the next. The changes come in increments.
We perform different selves for different people. Your coworkers see one side of you. Your friends another. Your lovers still another. You‚Äôre all of these, and none of these ‚Äî all at the same time.
We like to think of ourselves as consistent, but we‚Äôre not. We have moods and states of mind. Catch someone in a bad mood, and they might act like a completely different person.
Everyone should try to understand themselves better. But that‚Äôs not a one-off. You don‚Äôt hike the Appalachian Trail, discover yourself at a peek, and then spend the rest of your life in blissful self-awareness.
You‚Äôll engage in a process that goes on for your entire life. Sometimes, self discovery sucks. It happens in cheap motel rooms, or rest stops on trips you didn‚Äôt want to go on.
Recently, I‚Äôve learned that I don‚Äôt like traveling as much as I used to. It turns me into a cranky, miserable bitch. Maybe in a few years I‚Äôll enjoy it again ‚Äî like I used to. Right now, I‚Äôm kind of a homebody.
I used to be a real troublemaker. A fun weekend for me involved trespassing onto abandoned prisons and ghost hunting in old asylums and sanitariums. Bonus points if I could get drunk and break someone‚Äôs heart.
That‚Äôs not me these days. I‚Äôm boring now.
You might learn the most about yourself during the least interesting or satisfying periods of your life. What are you like when you don‚Äôt get what you want? Try that question.
You‚Äôre always learning about yourself ‚Äî not always comfortable truths. You might say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the kind of person who doesn‚Äôt take any bull shit.‚Äù If you‚Äôre honest, that might also mean you‚Äôre kind of a bitch.
I‚Äôve watched two people become obsessed with themselves. They both quit their jobs. Traveled. Loafed around.
That can be a good thing. But these two went overboard. When they returned, you could tell nothing had changed.
They were the same. Just more irritating. Because now they wanted to talk about all the epiphanies they were having.
They‚Äôd send out mass texts. Crap like, ‚ÄúI just learned something incredibly important about myself.‚Äù So we would meet them up for drinks and listen to them ramble about their newfound need for companionship. Or something. Some of us cared. I showed up for the entertainment.
I‚Äôm not saying I was a good person. Just that I didn‚Äôt feel the need to spend a thousand dollars to learn something about myself.
But I enjoyed watching other people try.
Eventually, these people calmed down and did grow as human beings. But not until they stopped poking and prodding themselves for meaning. I‚Äôm not sure what made them cease their pointless quest.
They just did. Maybe they saw their own hunger for attention in the mirror, and found another way to satisfy it.
Now that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd call an important self discovery.
You can understand yourself in lots of ways. Your job does say something about you. So do your habits. And your likes and dislikes. Your fashion sense. The way you talk. You‚Äôre the sum of all that, plus what different people think about you. But you‚Äôre really a 3D puzzle that‚Äôs been thrown out of an airplane over a desert. So am I. We could spend decades looking for pieces. We‚Äôll probably never find them all, and that‚Äôs okay. Don‚Äôt waste your life trying to construct the full picture.

Xiang Zhou|11.7K|7|https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-most-difficult-things-about-learning-to-code-by-yourself-b24ac8c3c23a?source=---------7---------------------|The most difficult things about learning to code by yourself ‚Äî and how to tackle them|"Many people have become interested in learning to code in recent years.
They either find their way into programming through online courses, or through offline meet ups, or are just simply trying to give it a shot.
Websites like code.org, codecademy and freeCodeCamp are becoming more and more popular. There are a huge number of coding courses out on the web, and also available on YouTube.
But coding isn‚Äôt easy. Here are some of the challenges we all face when learning to code.
If you are learning to code by yourself, chances are you have other responsibilities in life.
You could have a part time job, or a full time job, or you can be a stay at home parent. The point is, everyone is busy in this life. So how do you find the time to code everyday?
Some people may say: ‚ÄúWell, if you are dedicated enough, you can always find time.‚Äù True. I agree with that.
So then the question becomes: ‚ÄúHow much time should you dedicate everyday to code? If I can only get half an hour per day, does that still count?‚Äù
This is the question only you yourself can answer. It is very hard to estimate how many hours you should code each day. Some people suggest to keep it short and sweet. 15 minutes is good enough.
On the other side of the spectrum, I‚Äôve also heard people got into the development field within a year or so by coding 9 or 10 hours a day. If you want some motivation you can give that thread a look.
The bottom line is this: only you yourself know how much you can code everyday, and making it a habit of doing it, without getting burnt out. The last part is really important. freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson once said on his twitter feed:
Here is a video about a senior developer who has been in the tech field for decades talking about how much programming programmers do each day while they are at work.
It is not gonna be the golden standard, but it will give you an idea about how to set yourself a realistic, and most importantly, sustainable plan when it comes to learning to code everyday.
For me personally, I struggled with this a lot.
There are days I just could not understand a single concept/code snippet from the book I was reading. It just wasn‚Äôt sinking into my brain. I would get burnt out so bad that I‚Äôd have to calm myself down, go to the balcony, and take a deep breath.
From that point onwards I would keep reminding myself not to overwork it to the point that there was no coming back.
Programming is not easy. It requires you to concentrate, especially when you are learning new stuff. It is mentally taxing, and there are times that you can‚Äôt figure it out ‚Äî why your code didn‚Äôt work, or even why it did.
I found I was most productive whenever I was really concentrated on the problem I was working on right then, but at the same time I was really relaxed, enjoying the whole process.
This was when I:
To cope with the fact that a lot of the stuff we are learning is quite mundane and complex (data structures and algorithms and such), I have developed this 50/50 rule whenever I am learning to code.
I use 50% of the time to do the difficult tasks, studying the basics, concepts, algorithms and such. The other 50% of the time I am doing my own projects, projects I am really passionate about. So that there is a balance when it comes to my day-to-day study.
So, to put it bluntly, you need to love what you do. Which leads us to the next point.
As cliche as it sounds, sometimes this is simply just truth. If you love the path you are taking, love the job you are doing, love the direction you are going... you don‚Äôt need acknowledgements from the outside world.
This kind of fulfillment cannot be borrowed or replaced, or even worse, faked.
The reality is that when it comes to self-learning, it is never gonna be you yourself, being there, learning.
In life we all have all kinds of responsibilities we need to commit to. You might be a husband, or a wife, or someone‚Äôs parent. You need to take care of your family, or you have a job you need to attend to. Or maybe you are a student that needs to finish your diploma or degree.
With all the duties that are lying upon us, where do we find the time to code?
The truth is, sometimes you don‚Äôt or you simply just can‚Äôt. There are days that I skipped coding. The longest ‚Äúbreak‚Äù I took was two months.
But after that, I went back to coding immediately. And I found out that I had forgotten a lot of stuff I had learnt. It can be frustrating when you pick up the same book, and you simply don‚Äôt know how to continue. ‚ÄúGod, do I really have to re-read all the chapters and re-do all the quests again?‚Äù
This is the moment you just have to persevere, have to grind it out.
You need to tell yourself, ‚ÄúOkay, this first hour of study might seem really slow and not that productive. But that‚Äôs okay, I will make it up by learning more tomorrow.‚Äù
There is no way to sugarcoat this but to keep on going, keep on keeping on. Go to a coding forum or Twitter and express your frustration. But once you‚Äôve done that, immediately go back to coding.
Self-learning is very different to attending school. There is no one around you when you are coding. There are no classmates, there are no social interactions, you cannot find that ‚Äúgrand ceremony‚Äù waiting for you at the end of the tunnel. Most of the time you do it alone. And most of the time, you are alone.
So you need to find some kind of motivation to keep yourself moving forward.
I check this sub reddit all the time (r/macsetups) because a lot of people there are developers. And they are using all the same powerful hardware to create the software they wanna create. There is nothing more rewarding than that.
Also reward yourself, and make it a habit.
It could be small, or it could be big. It could be a hot shower at the end of the day, or a cold beverage. Tell yourself that you are doing a great job. It is often needed when learning to code. Hang this photo on the wall in front of you ‚Äî because you got to believe one day you can be the person who is sitting in front of it.
There are times we can get side-tracked when learning to code. I felt that there are moments that you just want to be lazy. Not in a way that you don‚Äôt want to learn anymore, but in a way that you secretly hope that by sitting in front of your monitor all day, you don‚Äôt have to face the real challenge: Getting a job as a developer.
Do not fall into that fallacy of thinking ‚ÄúI am learning so that‚Äôs good enough. I will think about jobs later, when I am ready.‚Äù
This is something I should be doing more often, to be frank. To reach out to potential clients, even if it is building website for free for families and friends.
So next time when you walk into an interview, you can show what kind of work you‚Äôve done. It will add value to your reÃÅsumeÃÅ. The first step is always the hardest. But you have to do it no matter what.
All of the above are challenges/situations you are gonna face on the road to becomming a developer. Acknowledge them, face them with the right attitude ‚Äî those hurdles you face can only make you stronger and better.
Last but not least, happy coding! Enjoy what you are building, whether it is your project or your own future.

Even if you‚Äôve got your dream job, it‚Äôs very likely that right now you could still be on a conference call you‚Äôd rather skip, scheduling some meeting you‚Äôre doing as a favor to someone else or dealing with some administrative detail you wish someone else would handle.
Or maybe you‚Äôre home from work and you‚Äôre picking up around the house. Maybe you‚Äôve got some writing to do and the resistance is setting in. Or you‚Äôve got homework, an application to fill out or someone to fire or need to have difficult conversation with your significant other.
It‚Äôs easy to blow these things off. It‚Äôs tempting to phone them in. But you can‚Äôt.
Because how you do anything, is how you do everything.
Long past his humble beginnings, President Andrew Johnson would speak proudly of his career as a tailor before he entered politics. ‚ÄúMy garments never ripped or gave way,‚Äù he would say.
On the campaign trail, a heckler once tried to embarrass him by shouting about his working-class credentials. Johnson replied without breaking stride: ‚ÄúThat does not disconcert me in the least; for when I used to be a tailor I had the reputation of being a good one, and making close fits, always punctual with my customers, and always did good work.‚Äù
Another president, James Garfield, paid his way through college in 1851 by persuading his school, the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute, to let him be the janitor in exchange for tuition. He did the job every day smiling and without a hint of shame. Each morning, he‚Äôd ring the university‚Äôs bell tower to start the classes ‚Äî his day already having long begun ‚Äî and stomp to class with cheer and eagerness.
Within just one year of starting at the school he was a professor ‚Äî teaching a full course load in addition to his studies. By his twenty-sixth birthday he was the dean.
This is what happens when you do your job ‚Äî whatever it is ‚Äî and do it well.
These men went from humble poverty to power by always doing what they were asked to do ‚Äî and doing it right and with real pride. And doing it better than anyone else. In fact, doing it well because no one else wanted to do it.
Sometimes, on the road to where we are going or where we want to be, we have to do things that we‚Äôd rather not do. Often when we are just starting out, our first jobs ‚Äúintroduce us to the broom,‚Äù as Andrew Carnegie famously put it. There‚Äôs nothing shameful about sweeping. It‚Äôs just another opportunity to excel ‚Äî and to learn.
But we are always so busy thinking about the future, we don‚Äôt take enough pride in the tasks we are given right now. Too often we phone it in, cash our check, and dream of some higher station in life. Or we think, This is just a job, it isn‚Äôt who I am, it doesn‚Äôt matter.
This is foolishness.
Everything we do matters ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs making smoothies to save up money or studying for the bar ‚Äî even after we‚Äôve already achieved the success we sought. Everything is a chance to do and be our best. Only self-absorbed assholes think they are too good for whatever their current station requires.
Wherever we are, whatever we‚Äôre doing and wherever we are going, we owe it to ourselves, to our art, to the world to do it well. That‚Äôs our primary duty. And our obligation. When action is our priority, vanity falls away.
An artist is given many different canvases and commissions in their lifetime, and what matters is that they treat each one as a priority. Whether it‚Äôs the most glamorous or highest paying is irrelevant. Each project matters, and the only degrading part is giving less than one is capable of giving.
Same goes for us. We will be and do many things in our lives. Some are prestigious, some are onerous, none are beneath us. To whatever we face, our job is to respond with:
We should never have to ask ourselves, But what am I supposed to do now? Because we know the answer: our job.
Whether anyone notices, whether we‚Äôre paid for it, whether the project turns out successfully ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt matter. We can and always should act with those three traits ‚Äî no matter the obstacle.
There will never be any obstacles that can ever truly prevent us from carrying out our obligation ‚Äî harder or easier challenges, sure, but never impossible. Each and every task requires our best. Whether we‚Äôre facing down bankruptcy and angry customers, or raking in money and deciding how to grow from here, if we do our best we can be proud of our choices and confident they‚Äôre the right ones. Because we did our job ‚Äî whatever it is.
Yeah, yeah, I get it. ‚ÄúObligations‚Äù sound stuffy and oppressive. You want to be able to do whatever you want.
But duty is beautiful, and inspiring and empowering.
Steve Jobs cared even about the inside of his products, making sure they were beautifully designed even though the users would never see them. Taught by his father ‚Äî who finished even the back of his cabinets though they would be hidden against the wall ‚Äî to think like a craftsman. In every design predicament, Jobs knew his marching orders: Respect the craft and make something beautiful.
Every situation is different, obviously. We‚Äôre probably not inventing the next iPad or iPhone, but we are making something for someone ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs just our own resume. Every part ‚Äî especially the work that nobody sees, the tough things we wanted to avoid or could have skated away from ‚Äî we can treat same way Jobs did: with pride and dedication.
The great psychologist Viktor Frankl, survivor of three concentration camps, found presumptuousness in the age-old question: ‚ÄúWhat is the meaning of life?‚Äù As though it is someone else‚Äôs responsibility to tell us. Instead, he said, the world is asking you that question. And it‚Äôs our job to answer with our actions.
In every situation, life is asking us a question, and our actions are the answer. Our job is simply to answer well.
Right action ‚Äî unselfish, dedicated, masterful, creative ‚Äî that is the answer to that question. That‚Äôs one way to find the meaning of life. And how to turn every obstacle into an opportunity.
If you see any of this as a burden, you‚Äôre looking at it the wrong way.
Because all we need to do is those three little duties ‚Äî to try hard, to be honest, and to help others and ourselves. That‚Äôs all that‚Äôs been asked of us. No more and no less.
Sure, the goal is important. But never forget that each individual instance matters, too ‚Äî each is a snapshot of the whole. The whole isn‚Äôt certain, only the instances
How you do anything is how you can do everything. We can always act right.

Cody McLain|32|6|https://medium.com/@neocody/the-value-of-a-life-calendar-91527e153d39?source=---------9---------------------|The Value of a Life Calendar ‚Äì Cody McLain ‚Äì Medium|"How often do you think about your life? That‚Äôs the question, legendary writer, Tim Urban proposed on a blog post, titled ‚ÄúYour Life in Weeks‚Äù back in 2014.
He showed variations of a calendar not from the perspective of a year, but an entire lifetime.
The goal of Tim‚Äôs post was to help us all live better lives by helping us understand the finite amount of time we‚Äôll have to live it.
To cite Carl Sagan, every king and peasant, hero and villain, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every corrupt politician, every supreme leader, saint and sinner all lived their lives within the confines of a life calendar.
Tim teaches us that we can either live our life by enjoying the present, (hoping not to succumb to instant gratification monkey) or work at the expense of our present selves to improve our future selves.
Sometimes we find ourselves neither feeling happy nor working towards building a brighter future. We can find ourselves living day by day feeling depressed, frustrated or upset; whether be due to having the wrong career, relationship, self-discipline or some other debilitating condition.
In my own journey of personal growth, as detailed in my short book, Life Optimization 101, I came to the conclusion that regularly reflecting on my past was one of the best tools to personal growth. It took many years to build up a habit of journaling regularly though.
Short of having a therapist, one of the best ways to improve yourself is through a combination of mindfulness and self-reflection. These can be difficult habits to maintain, let alone start though. Tim‚Äôs Life Calendar offers an easy way to start the practice of self-reflection with something that doesn‚Äôt take more than a minute or two each week.
I reflect on how each week anywhere from 30‚Äì60 minutes each week, but the gain I get from doing this over reflecting for 5 minutes might only be 50%, whereas the gain one could perceive from reflecting 0 minutes each week to just 5 or 10 is likely to be more like 150%.
Reflecting in the form of a Life Calendar has a very little downside and a much bigger upside. It allows you to get your feet wet and will make it easier to establish a more long-form reflection practice in the future.
My refrigerator contains a small version of the Life Calendar poster where I update weekly with a new colour to represent how I felt about that week.
The earlier parts consisting of solid purple, yellow, pink, red and orange exist to represent monumental changes in the earlier part of my life prior to having a Life Calendar. After that I chose to represent weeks in the following:
‚óè Green = Amazing Spectacular week!‚óè Blue = Pretty good Productive week, satisfied‚óè Purple = Traveled or took a trip somewhere‚óè Orange = Stressful, somewhat unproductive‚óè Red = Terrible Week
By simply labelling each week with a colour, it forces me to think back on the events of the week and to ask myself certain questions like:
‚óè What went really well this week? What did I do that worked?‚óè What got in the way? What didn‚Äôt work?‚óè How might I approach things differently in the future?
We all have days that feel amazing, followed by days we hope to never repeat again. The key to decreasing the bad weeks and increasing the good weeks is by reflecting on what made them so.
Having a Life Calendar isn‚Äôt going to lead to any shift in thinking, at least not immediately. You may never be able to correlate any changes in your life back to this habit, but you‚Äôll likely be able to look back a few years after this habit and find that your life has improved for the better.
Since Tim Urban published the Life Calendar post in 2014, he‚Äôs inspired a movement of entrepreneurs and creatives to start regularly reflecting on their lives. I‚Äôve done the research for you and listed the top ways to incorporate a Life Calendar of your own into your life.
Happy Life Calendaring!
The original poster that inspired it all available presently only in 24‚Äù by 36‚Äù size. It‚Äôs great to have a physical reminder of your life, perhaps taped up in your bedroom or refrigerator.
This is my favourite solution as you can update it wherever you are even on the weeks you travel. It‚Äôs synced across iCloud so your data is safe even if you lose your phone. The app itself is free with an in-app subscription of around $3/mo for additional customization options like icon and colour variations for each week. I‚Äôve found the free version to be good enough for most users though.
Why not remind yourself you‚Äôre going to die every time you open up a new tab? I‚Äôve found this to be a great way to help prevent procrastination as you momentarily contemplate your existence before choosing to open a distracting and time-wasting website. The extension is totally free and offers a way to track upcoming deadlines and even population growth.
Short of doling out money for a physical poster or app, this is the next best thing. Created by Felix Krause, a successful software engineer, it serves as a template anybody can copy and modify to suit their own life. With Gsheets built-in ‚ÄòUndo‚Äô function and great mobile apps, it‚Äôs a highly functional online life tracker.
This one is a bit different than any of the other methods but is arguably also one of the most interesting. All you do is enter in your birth date and it lives in your Mac‚Äôs menu bar showing an approximate percentage of how much of your life you‚Äôve lived to date. Perhaps not everybody would like such a visceral reminder of their mortality, but if it helps you procrastinate less then it‚Äôs worth a try.

Bruno (HE) Mirchevski|137|6|https://medium.com/the-logician/remove-the-word-cant-out-of-your-vocabulary-eb6b98bc6b1a?source=---------1---------------------|Remove the Word ‚ÄòCan‚Äôt‚Äô out of Your Vocabulary ‚Äì The Logician ‚Äì Medium|"Yes, there are days when you want to stay glued to the bed and stare at just one point of the ceiling. There are days when you think that it takes all the power of the world to move your muscles and start the day. The day sometimes seems too long and everything you want is to go back to bed. Probably the phrase that turns in your head is ‚ÄûI just can‚Äôt ...‚Äú
There isn‚Äôt an easy answer to this question. However, it seems that, sometimes, this is the easiest option. We simply give up on things.
I can‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt know how. Forget it, I am just not good enough.
These thoughts have certainly crossed your mind at least once. It‚Äôs normal and it happens to everyone. However, the problem appears when we allow these thoughts outweigh the positive ones. It‚Äôs when we stop noticing what we are doing and how it affects us.
We often surround ourselves with negative energy without realizing that this has a large influence on us and our mental or/and physical health.
According to a study (PDF) done at the National Yunlin University of Science and Technology in Taiwan, negative thinking comes easily and uninvited. Compared to positive thinking that requires some effort, this tends to be more common and easily spread. Moreover, negative thinking also tends to be ruminative to the thought process, and this can be seen through our anger, anxiety, or goal blockage.
In other words, it‚Äôs much easier to stay negative.
But is it also better?
Every time you say the word ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù or think of something negative, you insert a negative visualization of the problem in your head, making it even more vivid and difficult to overcome. Your mind creates a strong barrier because it has already seen the outcome, and it was not good.
In reality, it‚Äôs us who make things difficult.
You want to get that new job, but you don‚Äôt think that you qualify. And you might be right. However, saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, so I will just give up‚Äù is not going to do you any good. Instead, you need to replace it with ‚ÄúI can, but I need to work on my CV more, and then try again‚Äù.
When I say again, it‚Äôs because you need to try, even if you run the risk of failing. All of the best things in life do not come as easy. You will fail once, or twice, or more. But with each experience, you learn something new and use it to improve yourself.
Failing while trying to do something is not a failure. Not trying at all, is.
So, instead of saying that you can‚Äôt do something, wrap your head around the idea that it‚Äôs, in fact, possible. Maybe not now, but it will be. It‚Äôs up to you to get there, and you won‚Äôt be doing this by thinking negatively.
Note: Removing the word can‚Äôt from your vocabulary doesn‚Äôt mean that you should be reckless. You should be both rational and optimistic at the same time.
It‚Äôs not easy to just come up to someone and tell them to be happy. I am not trying to do that, as I know it‚Äôs not the way things work. As a matter of fact, it is scientifically proven that this approach has the opposite effect.
Instead, I am merely encouraging you to think outside the box and lose the comfort zone. It‚Äôs one of the things that block you from seeing who you really are and what you could possibly become.
What I am trying to say that you should acknowledge your potential and not be afraid of being afraid. This is the first step towards improving your life.
There are some tips and tricks that will help you to burst out of your negative bubble.
Many times we don‚Äôt even realize how negative we are, and how this affects our relationships with the people we love. This needs to change. You need to learn how to ‚Äúcatch‚Äô these thoughts as they arise in your head. The moment you realize that you are using the ‚Äúcan‚Äôts‚Äù and ‚Äúwon‚Äôts‚Äù, you should immediately stop the thought.
Only stopping the thought won‚Äôt do it. Take a deep breath and focus on that, instead of the negative thought. Give yourself time and space. After a few minutes and a few long breaths, you will feel slightly more relaxed.
Now, it‚Äôs time to change the can‚Äôt in ‚ÄúI can and I will‚Äù. You can add a ‚Äúsomeday‚Äù or ‚Äúsoon‚Äù to make your thoughts seem more realistic and achievable. However, you need to keep that thought. Our brains need 12 seconds to convey positive experiences to a long-term memory. If you don‚Äôt do this, your brain will quickly dismiss the thought.
Our habits shape us as individuals, both mentally and physically. Make this way of positive thinking a habit. Once you master the art of thinking positively and minimize the can‚Äôts in your life, you will notice a change in your life.
As much as your mood can affect the people in your life, in a negative or a positive way, the same goes for them as well. If you are surrounded by quitters, unambitious, negative or toxic people, you will eventually accept those traits yourself.
There are many reasons why people give up or do not try to start a plan or an idea. The fear of failure is an invisible ‚Äúforce‚Äù that keeps your mind in constant negation, so the goal that you want to achieve remains imaginary. Keep in mind that whatever you want to start needs effort, not just desire and dreams.
There will be obstacles and there will be crashes. I‚Äôd be lying if I said there won‚Äôt be. The world is stern for power and recognition. The world is full of competition and no one will allow you to easily climb to the top. It takes a lot of effort to succeed. You will fall, but you will bounce back. Life is a boisterous sea, and you are the captain who needs to spread the sails and sail tirelessly and bravely.
The world is mainly made of extremes. There is a day and there is the night. There is good and there is evil, there is a ‚ÄòCAN‚Äô, but ‚ÄòCAN‚ÄôTs‚Äô should not be allowed.
Remember that there is nothing like instant success. Regardless of the development of technology and all possibilities, hard work, knowledge, and talent are timeless attributes which will lead you to the desired success.
Evaluate your every step. Learn from the error, analyze what needs to be corrected and what you want to achieve. The road to success is a continuous process of learning and growing. You can never know what you could do if you don‚Äôt try. Think how much the goal you want to achieve, arouses excitement, ambition, and happiness inside you and is valuable for your time and money.
We all have many things in life that we try to pay equal attention and effort to. At the end of the day, it seems that there is not enough motivation and energy left in us for any other activity. But fulfilling a task can be a generous motive for starting others.
Your mind is your weapon, train yourself to be persistent and shoot at the target.
There is nothing that you can not achieve, believe in yourself, the word ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äú does not exist!
Get used to that concept.

You must write down what is important to you and establish what are your goals. After writing it down , set a date . Keep your written goals visible all around you . It might mean to save it on your phone screensaver, write it on your mirror , door , etc. Get creative so you are reminded of them daily .
You will subconsciously remember your goals even in your sleep . It‚Äôs like breathing but you don‚Äôt think about it , until now because i just wrote about it . You will need to set up a budget . Write down all your expenses and those extra spending that you ‚Äúneed‚Äù. See what you can take out . It might mean not going out and making a home made meal ‚Äî that‚Äôs healthier in my honest opinion . Or even cooking for the next day to take lunch to work instead of spending $15-$20 on lunch .
As for me I leave my debit card and carry cash . When the cash leaves me , I feel it like the titanic sinking. Try it for a week and record your results. . As far for the wedding , prepare yourself to sit down with more than 4 vendors and compare prices . Once you do that , negotiate . You are the buyer not the seller !

Srinivas Rao|19.6K|9|https://medium.com/the-mission/how-writing-1000-words-a-day-changed-my-life-cf72453b8fef?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|How Writing 1000 Words a Day Changed my Life ‚Äì The Mission ‚Äì Medium|"When I interviewed Julien Smith for the first time in 2012, he had one of the most popular blogs on the internet. Of all the things he shared with me in our conversation, one thing he said stood out to me. I write 1000 words every day.
Shortly after that conversation I started writing 1000 words a day and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been doing ever since. To say that the habit changed my life would be an understatement.
What started first out of curiosity, eventually turned into something that I had to do out of necessity. The demands on my production increased dramatically almost overnight.
In order to keep up with the demand, I had to develop a system.
As I‚Äôve said before, systems are essential to increasing your creative output. 1000 words a day became my system. Within a few months it was a habit so deeply ingrained into my life that it was like brushing my teeth. And that‚Äôs when things started to get really interesting.
As part of my 1000 words I would publish a really long Facebook status update, what I jokingly referred to as committing career suicide one status update at a time. After a few months my writing started resonating with people like it never had before. In September of 2013, I compiled all of my Facebook status updates into a google doc, had it edited, had Mars Dorian design a book cover, uploaded it to Amazon and called it the Art of Being Unmistakable.
The first week it sold 300 copies and I considered that a success. But about three weeks later, a media circus erupted. When I check the rankings on Amazon, I noticed that my book was #1 in the entrepreneurship category. When I tweeted about it, somebody said ‚Äúyou might want to thank Glenn Beck. He raved about your book on his show today.‚Äù When I asked a friend she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you realize how big a deal this is, check your sales.‚Äù When I logged into the Amazon dashboard, I noticed that the book had sold 1000 copies in a day. Shortly after that I ended up being on the Glenn Beck show and my self published book became a Wall Street Journal Best Seller.
Between 2013 and 2015, I never stopped writing 1000 words a day. A few months into 2015, I got the following email from an editor at Penguin Portfolio.
I recently rejoined publishing after working at online education startups, having just left Skillshare to join the Penguin Random House team. While it might seem counterintuitive, I came back just for this specific division that works and thinks differently than most of the industry ‚Äî and is setting out to help entrepreneurs and changemakers with the stories, experiences, and motivation of people who have successfully forged their own path, people like Seth Godin, Guy Kawasaki, Ryan Holiday, Nir Eyal, Nick Bilton, and more. You are one of those people, and are top of my list of who to contact to work on a book together.
Writing in many ways is like planting seeds. You plant seeds today for the person you eventually want to become. After a few conversations, my daily writing habit resulted in a 2 book deal. The first book Unmistakable: Why Only is Better Than Best was released on August 2, 2016. And I‚Äôm currently working on my second book.
So how exactly do you incorporate this habit into your life?
You have to design an environment that‚Äôs conducive to the person you want to become. If you want to become a writer, your environment should reflect that. If you came to my apartment you would notice two things:
1) I read a lot of books
2) I have stacks of Moleskine notebooks
It‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôd notice something similar in the environment of anybody else who is a writer. When I ate dinner at Tucker Max‚Äôs house for the first time, the first thing that caught my attention was the sheer number of books he had. In Ryan Holiday‚Äôs post about maintaining a physical library you‚Äôll see that he has multiple bookshelves that are filled from floor to ceiling.
In his book The Happiness Advantage, the author Shawn Achor talks about how reducing the amount of energy it takes to do something increases the likelihood you‚Äôll do it. Something as simple as decreasing the number of mouse clicks to do something will increase your odds of doing it.
The simple hack for this is using a distraction free writing tool like Macjournal. Set it up the night before, so when you flip open your laptop in the morning, it‚Äôs the first thing you see. Then you just write. If you prefer to write with a paper notebook, put it out with a pen the night before. The simple act of putting your notebook out the night before with a pen increases the likelihood that you‚Äôll actually follow through on writing.
Another variation of this hack is to write one sentence the night before, ideally right before you go to sleep. Write down somebody else‚Äôs words. Suddenly the page appears less daunting. This is one of the many reasons I always read before I write. Since your brain makes progress towards a goal based on how close it thinks it is towards that goal, starting with a quote allows you tap into the power of success accelerants.
It‚Äôs likely your early writing efforts will be lousy. Don‚Äôt be afraid to write a shitty first sentence. To this day only a small amount of what I produce on a daily basis is actually usable. But when you write 7000 words a week, you don‚Äôt need much to be useable. Say you write 1000 words a week that are decent. That‚Äôs 52,000 words. That‚Äôs one book in a year. Your cumulative output matters more than any individual writing day. If you want to become a better writer, start by becoming a prolific one.
It‚Äôs possible during the course of 90 minutes of writing that you‚Äôll wander. This happens to me all the time. I‚Äôll get 3‚Äì4 paragraphs into a train of thought and suddenly I‚Äôm writing stream of consciousness psychobabble. At this point your natural temptation will be to give up or give into a source of distraction. But if you can resist this temptation and just let the verbal vomit show up on the page, you‚Äôll get back to a place of making sense. In that sense it‚Äôs a bit like meditation. You simply observe the wandering mind and return to focusing on your breath.
Inspiration is an unreliable strategy for creative work. The muse is a fickle mistress and she tends to show up on her own schedule. You on the other hand have the option to show up every day. By showing up every day, you tap into the profound power of consistency. Something that starts as an item on your to do list eventually becomes a habit and you start to build momentum.
On a related note- if you struggle with habits, I‚Äôve put a guide together on optimizing productivity & creativity. Sign up for my newsletter here and you‚Äôll receive it shortly.
Inspiration has a funny way of striking at unusual times. Usually you‚Äôre not in front of the computer when this happens. A habit I picked up from my friend AJ Leon is to always carry a notebook. A notebook is like fertile soil where you can plant seeds for your creative ideas.
If you pay attention to how you work, you‚Äôll start to see patterns. These patterns are incredibly useful in helping you to develop systems and mental models for you to get your work done. They give you a personal operating manual for yourself. Recognizing patterns helps you adjust your behavior to reach optimal levels of performance.
These patterns play themselves out throughout our lives. Not just in our work. They occur in nearly every situation. You might notice something as simple as a phrase in an email that always elicits a positive response. If that‚Äôs the case it makes no sense to deviate from that pattern.
You might think that adjusting to patterns might make your life repetitive and boring, but the opposite seems to be true. The beauty of recognizing patterns in your life is that it frees up your cognitive bandwidth for much higher value activities than trying to decide how you plan to behave for the day. Recognizing patterns in your life requires you to take actually take time, slow down and reflect on the results that your behavior is producing.
If x causes y, then it would make sense that you choose the x that causes the y that you want. As you recognize patterns you‚Äôll begin not only work more efficiently but work more effectively. By utilizing the patterns you recognize to develop processes and systems, you free your mind up to think creatively. If your mind is taxed with decisions like how long and how much you‚Äôre depleting your willpower.
One of the most valuable sections of the BestSelf journal is Lessons learned for the day. We learn tons of lessons every day, but without the discipline to capture them, it‚Äôs no better than if we didn‚Äôt learn them at all. In fact this idea of patterns was inspired by a lesson I learned yesterday which was that 90 minutes of deep work was my consistent sweet spot. Once I saw that pattern I started looking for other ones. As you recognize patterns in your life, you‚Äôll go from a frenetic scatterbrained pace to one that is fast paced, focused, sustainable and generates momentum.
There‚Äôs a point at which any habit you adopt eventually becomes a part of who you are. You no longer have to think about it. It‚Äôs what James Clear refers to as an identity based habit If you see in me in a coffeeshop, at a conference, or anywhere else before 8am, it‚Äôs more than likely you‚Äôll find me writing 1000 words. This is no longer something I just do. It‚Äôs who I am. In order for a habit to truly change your life, it has to become a practice, likely one that is lifelong.

Maybe by your spouse, boss, parents, or best friend? Or even a stranger?
It happened to me many times in the past. Growing up, I always had an opinion about everything.
Having an opinion doesn‚Äôt mean you know everything. It just means you have something to say. You could be wrong.
But often times, my teachers, friends, girlfriends, co-workers, and even friends would immediately say things like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true!‚Äù So gradually, I gave up speaking my mind. I became afraid.
Last week, I published an article about why I avoid toxic people. I mentioned that I think less than 1% of the population has values.
You wouldn‚Äôt believe how many people were offended by my opinion. ‚ÄúHow do you know it‚Äôs less than 1%!‚Äù And a bunch of nasty words. Two people even emailed me a whole essay about why it‚Äôs ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù
People were truly hurt. Ironically, in the same article, I mentioned that if you feel hurt, that‚Äôs because you decided that.
In the article, I clearly stated my opinion. The sentence starts with ‚ÄúI think,‚Äù for a reason.
Of course, I have no idea exactly how many people lack values. No one knows.
Plus, everything that‚Äôs presented as a fact in life is, in reality, an opinion. So when people try to challenge your opinions, know that they are playing a useless game.
There‚Äôs only your truth. It reminds me of a section in my book, THINK STRAIGHT. Here it is:
Are facts also the truth? The answer is no. Confusing, right? It‚Äôs just like life. For example, does God exist? I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve never seen any evidence. Does that mean God is not real? It doesn‚Äôt matter what I think. If God has an impact on the way you live, it‚Äôs true for you no matter what scientists say.
Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher who had a profound impact on western philosophy, famously said: ‚ÄúThere are no facts, only interpretations.‚Äù
Nietzsche was a man of true self-knowledge. Sigmund Freud even said that ‚Äúhe had a more penetrating knowledge of himself than any other man who ever lived or was ever likely to live.‚Äù
He was a very analytical thinker, especially when it came to his own thoughts. When Nietzsche said that there are no facts, he meant that we, as human beings, ultimately rely on our interpretations of reality. There‚Äôs no way to confirm reality objectively.
That doesn‚Äôt mean nothing is real and that we‚Äôre all living in a big dream. We just have to realize that facts are not the same thing as the truth.
That simple thought saves you a lot of energy because it means no one can be right or wrong. Don‚Äôt bother with convincing people with different opinions of the ‚Äútruth.‚Äù It‚Äôs just not a practical thing to do. Save your energy for other, more useful things.
Look, I used to be afraid to say what I thought.
It doesn‚Äôt matter. You know why? There‚Äôs no universal truth. We all know nothing. So you might as well say what you think. Because without opinions, life would be like a cracker.
A boring piece of dry toast with salt. Who likes to eat crackers every day for the rest of their lives?!
Also, don‚Äôt be apologetic. Think about important things in your life, relationships, and career. Have clear opinions about them. And then: Own your truths.
I learned this three years ago from Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote this in his 1841 Essay, Self-Reliance:
You know what I did after I read this? I started my blog and started speaking my mind. And that changed my life.
Remember: There‚Äôs no universal truth or higher authority in life. You can say and think whatever you want.
No one will stop you as long as it comes from a good place.
There‚Äôs one condition though: Take ownership of your words. If you‚Äôre wrong, admit it with confidence. And be respectful.
That will also boost your self-confidence. Give it a try.
What do you think?

In the beginning, there‚Äôs not enough food to go around because of a famine. People are starving, and they can only afford to feed the stronger family members. One night, the children overhear their parents talk about leaving them in the forest to fend for themselves.
Fortunately Hansel has a plan. He sneaks outside to collect a bunch of pebbles, placing them in his pocket before going to bed.
‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù Gretel asks.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see,‚Äù her brother responds.
The next morning, Hansel and Gretel are sent on an errand to collect firewood in the forest. Their parents reassure them they‚Äôll get picked up when night falls. As they walk away from the house, Hansel secretly drops one pebble at a time until they are deep in the forest.
By night time, the wolves are howling and Gretel fears for their lives. They‚Äôre lost at this point, and the wolves‚Äô yellow eyes are looking at them like they‚Äôre dinner.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a fire,‚Äù Hansel suggests.
Once the flames burst up, they see a strange line of dots glistening. It turns out the pebbles that Hansel dropped earlier are reflecting the light from the fire. The trail of pebbles provides a sense of direction, allowing Hansel and Gretel to find their way home.
In your own life, you‚Äôve been leaving behind a trail of pebbles all along as well.
Do you ever catch yourself thinking, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do with my life!‚Äù?
And what do we do in response? We just go about performing mundane tasks day by day, thinking that maybe a fantastic idea will sprout out of the ground and give us a sense of direction.
Someday, we‚Äôll just figure it all out.
Of course, this rarely (if ever) happens.
And the worst part is, before we know it, years have gone by.
Instead, look for the pebbles in your life. Chances are, you‚Äôll be able to find some things in your past experiences that provide direction for the future.
For example, maybe when you look back you notice that you spend a lot of free time looking at books on building design. Maybe architecture is a big interest in your life.
And no, it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to run off and suddenly become an architect!
What it does mean is that this is something worth investigating. You could enroll in an introductory class on architecture, or talk to architects about their experiences. Why not do both?
If there‚Äôs something that you‚Äôre interested in, look into it more. You don‚Äôt have to (and shouldn‚Äôt) jump something right away. Investigate a bit more into your past interests to see how far along you should follow them.
Your past behavior is a strong indicator for how you‚Äôll act and respond to situations in the future. Over time, these tendencies come out over and over again.
It‚Äôs interesting how people can observe things about us that would never have occurred in our heads. They take notice of something and then might make a comment in passing:
When various people make comments like this, there‚Äôs something going on. Listen when this happens.
Looking forward, it seems difficult to figure out what we should be doing, or whether we‚Äôre making the right decisions. But when we pursue something that almost comes naturally, it almost seems blindingly obvious.
As Steve Jobs once said, ‚ÄúYou can only connect the dots looking backward.‚Äù
In a world of choices, there are so many possibilities out there and we‚Äôre forced to choose. As a result, we find ourselves hopping from one thing to another.
Other times, external pressures or current trends cause us to make decisions that we normally wouldn‚Äôt have done. After all, if your friends are doing something, it‚Äôs easier to follow along right?
But if you look closely, you might find that there are some things, regardless of trends and external factors, that you find yourself gravitating towards.
Sometimes, we have interests or skills that we don‚Äôt even realize. Someone might say, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you do that?‚Äù
And we might shrug, figuring that if we can do something, it must come easily to everyone else. If you have people come to you for help on something or are surprised that something you can do so well, pay attention. You could learn something about yourself that everyone already knew.
What are the pebbles in your own life? Do they form a trail and lead you somewhere?

Tony Fahkry|203|6|https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-give-meaning-to-your-life-and-awaken-your-greatest-potential-c98d7cde1830?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|How To Find Meaning In Your Life And Awaken Your Greatest Potential|"Many people believe that to give meaning to life requires a pilgrimage to a desolate part of the world, working with indigenous tribes and being of service.
While I do not discount the value of this selfless work, the truth is that we can give meaning to our life through our own power to define what is important to us.
You already have the power to create meaning and purpose in your life, not so much in what you do, but in what it means to you and the meaning you attach to it.
For instance a person sweeping floors can define their life as being meaningful if the money they earn provides adequate food and shelter for their family.
What you do does not create the meaning ‚Äî it is the meaning you assign to what you do that is important. The meaning you hold toward something is represented from a deeper place within you. That is to say that the act or thing does not in itself define you.
For example, many people arrive at a crossroad in their life, which is generally around middle age where they feel they must achieve a certain status or have acquired a certain level of recognition.
They cleverly recite their rewards and achievements believing all too well that having accomplished or acquired these things, that they will be more content and have achieved their purpose in life.
In truth, many of these same people feel a sense of lack and emptiness because the pursuit or goal was not imbued with passion and purpose. They failed to acknowledge the deeper meaning behind why they set out to achieve that goal in the first place. They lost their way in the pursuit of it.
You have the power to create and define the meaning you attach to everything you do ‚Äî including your life‚Äôs purpose ‚Äî by creating it yourself. It might contradict what society defines as successful but does it really matter?
Even defining success in itself is arbitrary and may be challenged in many ways. Success is not something you acquire as it remains elusive if you pursue it. Success is a state of being. You can be successful handing out mailbox letter drops if it brings you happiness and fulfillment.
Society has attempted to place a square around what it values as a success and for this reason there are many wealthy, unhappy and unfulfilled people. These same people find joy and happiness when they lose themselves in service to others through volunteer work or any social community charitable work.
The key is to not allow yourself to be defined by what others view as success, since in doing so, you will be living up to an unattainable goal, one that you will never reach. Redefine success by giving it your definition as opposed to someone else‚Äôs.
The more we attempt to live by a set of rules and precepts, the more we are under the influence of other‚Äôs ideals. It is essential that one defines their own level of success and not aim to achieve success but rather to become and embody success.
Have you noticed that successful people attract successful situations and events into their life? This is not because of who they are but because of who they are being.
So to create meaning in one‚Äôs life, it is important that you simplify your life by finding out what is important to you. I suggest that you make a list and take the time to contemplate what the most important aspects of your life are and eliminate anything which competes against the pursuit of this importance.
For example, if you list health, family, relationships and career, then you have a strong representation of what brings you fulfillment, joy and happiness since these are the areas where you feel most appreciated and rewarded.
It holds value that you would spend and allocate much of your resources and energy tending toward these aspects of your life and subsequently give less energy toward other areas of your life.
Simplify life by determining what is important to you. The elderly will tell you they wish they could have given more time and energy to those things that were important to them.
The point of the story as you no doubt understand is that many of life‚Äôs events come and go, although the things that remain important to you should be acknowledged and revered since these are the things that really matter.
Life can pass us all too quickly if we are not willing to embrace the experiences and remain grounded in the present moment, which is a true blessing. Do not allow yourself to reflect back on your past or hope for a better future since that takes away from the beauty that is the NOW.
Prioritising what is important to you and making that your focus allows you to simplify life and live it with passion, rather than trying to fill the jar with meaningless things that ultimately do not matter.
When we re-engineer our lives from reverse, the premise is that we are looking at life from the perspective of being on our death bed and contemplating what is really important to us.
By determining what is important allows you to orientate your energy and resources toward those things by making space and room for them in your life. The adage of less is more holds true in this case since we really do not require a great deal to provide happiness.
Once you determine what is important to you, you must strive to live by these principles by infusing and embodying them as your truth.
Make a list of those things in your life which take up your valuable energy and resources but do not deliver the same level of joy, fulfillment and happiness. Do not be persuaded by what you should be doing as since it is a simple choice that brings you closer towards happiness or pulls you further away.
The moment you ask empowering questions and start living the answers, you will be making a statement to the universe declaring the life you wish to lead. Your thoughts, words and actions become your affirmations toward life.
So you create meaning to life by first deciding and embarking upon the life that you wish to live. Your statement to the universe is your degree in which you are prepared to work towards your passion and your purpose.
Finally, to give meaning and purpose to your life, choose to live by a set of principles, beliefs and values which are uniquely yours.
Do not be swayed or coerced into believing what others believe just because it is the popular thing to do. This will never get you far in life.
Some people spend their entire life buying into a concept of what is right for them to find that they had it all wrong after all.
Refuse to go to your deathbed not having explored your greatest potential. Seek to be a wet sponge, wrung out and used up so that when you die, you will have explored every morsel of your talent and genius.
Refuse to give up or rest on your laurels until you have created the meaning you wish to express in the world.

It‚Äôll Help You Focus Faster ‚Äì The Mission ‚Äì Medium|"Are you having trouble deciding on your priorities for the year?
Or maybe you‚Äôve dozens of tasks in your to-do list app but feel unsure how to get going, never mind what to work on first?
The right constraint can help you find your focus and achieve your goals faster.
Don‚Äôt worry, practical constraints are about more than eating porridge or wearing a grey T-shirt every day.
Try the Pomodoro Technique to get more from your valuable working hours.
Get a timer, set it for 30 minutes, and work on your most important task until the buzzer sounds. Then, take a short two-minute break before returning to your most important task and resetting the timer.
Ideally, stack these sessions on top of each other until you finish the task at hand.
A web designer once told me many entrepreneurs go ‚Äúcolor and font crazy‚Äù when building a site or presentation. His advice?
Pick two and certainly no more than three fonts, colours, and heading styles, and stick with them. Design software Canva can help you with this.
Limiting your options will help you avoid feeling overwhelmed by the array of fonts and colors at your disposal when creating a presentation or webpage.
Let‚Äôs say you need to write and submit an important report by Friday afternoon.
Rather than spending all week crafting War and Peace, use the constraint of 500 or 1,000 words to decide what to include and exclude.
As an example, I once worked with a chief marketing officer who said he didn‚Äôt have time for 50- or 100- page reports and preferred two page summaries.
Your time-strapped readers might thank you for applying this constraint.
Don‚Äôt agonize about what to do every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and so on. Instead, pick a theme for each day and stick to it.
Spend Mondays on customer research, Tuesdays on product development, Wednesdays on marketing. And so on.
Having a theme for individual days related to your work will give you mental clarity about what to do and when.
Many entrepreneurs have trouble deciding on their priorities for the entire year. Instead of feeling anxious about what you will or won‚Äôt get done over the next 52 weeks, pick your top three priorities for this month or even just this week.
For example, one online entrepreneur told me he‚Äôs spending the third quarter of 2018 optimizing his website for search and lead generation. He‚Äôll still work on other tasks, but they‚Äôre secondary.
These days, we can pick from more productivity and business tools than ever before. Managing the logins and passwords alone is a job in itself.
Instead of wasting time learning new tools or clicking ‚ÄúReset password,‚Äù pick one for the job at hand, for example a single design application or word processor. After all, done is better than perfect, and you can always try a different tool (and a more memorable password) next time.
According to consumer researchers Moreau and Dahl, reducing your inputs might help you become more creative.
So if you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information on your desk, refine and reduce it to what‚Äôs essential. Rather than reading dozens of reports and papers, pick two or three of the most relevant ones and concentrate on those.
It‚Äôs fun to riff on Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs choice of attire once you understand that constraints are useful productivity tools.
Choosing a practical and relevant constraint should help you focus on what matters and work through a to-do list faster. Now, pick just one.
Ready to supercharge your productivity?
I‚Äôve created a cheat sheet that will help you FOCUS immediately. Follow this and you‚Äôll accomplish more than you can imagine.

Vishal Kataria|330|6|https://theascent.pub/this-simple-action-is-all-it-takes-to-stick-to-your-goals-b31aba051cdd?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|This Simple Action is All it Takes to Stick to Your Goals|"The demand for online courses industry has shot through the roof.
In 2015, the global market for such courses reached $107 billion. Just two years later, the market grew to $255 billion ‚Äî a whopping 238 percent growth within 2 years!
But there‚Äôs something more. And it‚Äôs not good.
A study revealed that the average completion for Massive Open Online Courses ‚Äî MOOCs ‚Äî is a dismal fifteen percent.
I‚Äôll admit. I‚Äôm part of the 85 percent. Barring a couple, almost every online course I‚Äôve signed up for has stalled at the halfway stage.
It‚Äôs not just online courses that lie unfinished. College degrees, novels, paintings, songs, projects... every day millions of goals get abandoned.
Nobody begins pursuing their goals with the idea of giving up. When people start something new, it feels amazing. They feel a surge of energy as they begin to shape their vision.
But as the work gets tougher, their effort declines for various reasons ‚Äî new responsibilities, lack of time, too hard, ‚Äújust can‚Äôt do this right now.‚Äù All these reasons boil down to one thing ‚Äî aversion against discomfort.
People value their comfort zone more than anything else, even money. That‚Äôs why many of us enroll for courses that we don‚Äôt complete, rent studios to do work that we never finish, and hire consultants and coaches to help us set goals that we never pursue.
Everyone loves thinking about the outcome. What it will look like, how we will feel AFTER we‚Äôve achieved it. Daydreaming doesn‚Äôt demand much. If anything, it keeps us in our comfort zone.
But taking action TO achieve the goal pushes us outside our comfort zone. And that‚Äôs one thing we don‚Äôt want to compromise on at all.
We want to get fitter, but we don‚Äôt want to exercise.
We want to save money, but we don‚Äôt want to change our spending habits.
We want to write a book, but we don‚Äôt want to sit down at the table, think, and put the words on paper (or a document).
When you set a goal but leave it midway, you do yourself more harm than good.
For example, each time you lose momentum, you have to work twice as hard to get back to your original rhythm. This Sisyphean feeling takes all the fun out of doing something for the love of it instead of love for the outcome.
Also, the vast chasm of feelings between the vicarious joy you experienced when you imagined the goal achieved and the secret disappointment you felt when you gave up make you feel like shit (and guilty).
And you try to suppress this feeling of guilt and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good for nothing‚Äù by consuming more content, eating more junk food, wasting more time, and blaming the world for your condition.
Look. If blaming the world helped people achieve their results, everyone would do it.
Okay, almost everyone does it, but because it makes them feel better in the present moment. In the long run, it‚Äôs as destructive as exposing yourself to outrages on social media every day.
Do your future self a favor: Stop complaining and start doing just one key thing to stick to what matters.
The journey to a thousand miles starts with a single step. But you cannot reach the destination if you stop after ten steps.
On the other hand, continuing your journey doesn‚Äôt demand that you turn into a superhero. It just demands that you take one step at a time.
Not so tough, is it?
You don‚Äôt need extreme self-discipline. You don‚Äôt have to hole yourself up in the Batcave for ten hours a day. You don‚Äôt have to give up on everything you enjoy.
You just have to show up every day. You just need enough self-discipline to stick to your average pace.
Your average pace, according to James Clear, is what pushes you enough to make progress, but not so much that it becomes unsustainable.
Here are some examples.
If you exercise thrice a week, you‚Äôll have exercised 72 times at the end of six months.
If you put 100 bucks in a cookie jar each day, you‚Äôll have saved 18,000 bucks at the end of six months, which you can invest in a mutual fund.
If you write one page for your book each day, you‚Äôll complete 180 pages at the end of six months.
As you can see, your average pace will produce long-term results that will make you feel proud of yourself.
Sticking to your average pace also has a hidden advantage It turns these actions into habits which, in turn, increase your average pace. And once you learn to stretch your limits in one aspect of life, you begin to apply it in every other aspect.
Simple question, simple answer.
When you want to buy a new mobile phone, you have two options for action.
One, you can gather mounds of information from friends and the internet, wait to check whether the rumors about new model launches are true, and drag your feet.
But that‚Äôs not what you do, is it? You often follow the second option, which is:
Follow the same regime for your actions.
Read up about steps to begin what you want to. Then go on a content-fast: stop consuming content and start taking action. Keep the chain going. If you don‚Äôt show up for two days in a row, make sure you don‚Äôt miss the third.
When you hit a wall, get information on it, go on a content-fast, and take action.
Rinse, repeat.
I‚Äôll admit, doing so requires courage.
To hit the gym when you would rather veg out on the sofa and watch Netflix.
To save up when you would rather buy the latest smartphone model because your six-month-old phone feels outdated.
To write your book when your friends ask you to join them for Friday-evening parties.
To be called primitive for missing a few episodes of Game of Thrones because you were working on your goal.
But think about Future You. What will Future You thank you for one year, two years, five years down the line? For not compromising on your comfort zone? Or for showing up every day to do what you promised yourself you would?
Consistency matures you. It‚Äôs the best investment you can make in yourself.
Move ahead, one step at a time, one day at a time. Gain a yard each day.
A yard seems tiny now, but at the end of six months, you‚Äôll have crossed the football field.

You will subconsciously remember your goals even in your sleep . It‚Äôs like breathing but you don‚Äôt think about it , until now because i just wrote about it . You will need to set up a budget . Write down all your expenses and those extra spending that you ‚Äúneed‚Äù. See what you can take out . It might mean not going out and making a home made meal ‚Äî that‚Äôs healthier in my honest opinion . Or even cooking for the next day to take lunch to work instead of spending $15-$20 on lunch .
As for me I leave my debit card and carry cash . When the cash leaves me , I feel it like the titanic sinking. Try it for a week and record your results. .

Benjamin P. Hardy|3.3K|18|https://medium.com/thrive-global/harvard-research-justin-timberlake-movie-how-to-upgrade-your-economic-status-d702a2d28256?source=---------0---------------------|Harvard Research + Justin Timberlake Movie: How To Upgrade Your Economic Status|"In the Science Fiction film, ‚ÄúIn Time,‚Äù Justin Timberlake portrays a character named Will Salas, who lives in the ghetto.
In the movie, there is no ‚Äúmoney.‚Äù Instead, time is the only currency, and everyone has a digital clock embedded into their arms.
Until the age of 25, your clock doesn‚Äôt start ticking. Once you hit your 25th birthday, you have just one year of life that starts ticking down immediately.
Everything costs time. For example, in the movie, a cup of coffee doesn‚Äôt cost 4 dollars, but rather, 4 minutes.
There are small devices, similar to the devices we plug our credit cards into, that add or take away time when scanned on a person‚Äôs arm clock.
After age 25, you stop physically aging. Whether you‚Äôre 28, 49, or 302, you look as you did when your clock started ticking.
You live as long as you have time.
The people living in the ghetto are living day-to-day, while those in the highest ‚ÄúTime Zone‚Äù can conceivably live forever.
In the ghetto, people literally are living day-to-day. They get time added to their ‚Äúclocks‚Äù at the end of every shift ‚Äî enough to get them to the end of the next shift. They rarely have more than 24 hours on their clocks. As a result, they can‚Äôt stop thinking about or ‚Äúchecking‚Äù their time.
They are required to work, every single day, in order to survive.
As soon as your clock runs out, you die.
In the movie, Economic Status is portrayed as ‚ÄúTime Zones,‚Äù which are not easy to transfer one for another.
You have to pay a great deal of time to get from one zone to the next. Here‚Äôs the break-down:
To cross a Time Zone, you are required to pay a great deal of money.
For someone living in the ghetto, the system is not designed to ever have a full month saved-up. Thus, ever getting out the ghetto is practically impossible.
When you‚Äôre living day-to-day, time goes very quickly. You have no future to look forward to. You don‚Äôt have time to vacation and think. You‚Äôre in survival mode.
Hence, time goes very quickly.
Will Salas (played by Timberlake) finds his way out of the ghetto and into New Grenich and despite his best acting, is clearly perceived by others as being from somewhere else.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not from here are you, Mr. Salas?‚Äù the waitress asks him.
‚ÄúWhat gives you that impression?‚Äù Will responds.
‚ÄúYou do everything too quickly,‚Äù she responds back.
As you go up in ‚ÄúTime Zones,‚Äù life slows down. You‚Äôre no longer living day-to-day, perhaps now you‚Äôre living month-to-month.
You have a little more time to waste on entertainment and, perhaps, if you‚Äôre one of the smart ones, you begin investing a little here and a little there into your future.
But even still, the cost of living goes up with each Time Zone you‚Äôre in. So it‚Äôs not exactly easy to save up.
You have to keep up with your neighbors, for example. You‚Äôre required, socially, to have a car and home that fits the culture. The food costs just a little bit more, and so do your clothes. Life is driven by marketing and social acceptance for most people.
Making money is one thing, managing it is entirely different.
In New Grenich, it can cost a few month‚Äôs of ‚ÄúTime‚Äù to stay in a hotel and several weeks to eat a fancy meal.
Money, or in this case, ‚ÄúTime,‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean the same in different zones.
Spending 8 weeks for a meal can, strangely, make complete sense in one situation, where that much ‚ÄúTime‚Äù is enough to get you killed in the ghetto. Those 8 weeks could change the entire trajectory of a family living in the ghetto...if they knew what to do with it.
To even get into New Grenich (i.e., among the mega-wealthy) costs One Year of Time. Once you‚Äôre in, everything costs a fortune. However, the ability to make money in that Zone is also completely skewed as well.
Although the ideas from In Time is science-fiction in nature, they actually have real life application based on Harvard Economics.
A few economists at Harvard began a project known as ‚ÄúThe Equality Of Opportunities Project,‚Äù several years ago. The research was so revolutionary and important that it has since expanded into something much bigger and more global.
The goal of the project, ‚ÄúIs to develop scalable policy solutions that will empower families throughout the United States to rise out of poverty and achieve better life outcomes.‚Äù
One of the fundamental outcomes they‚Äôve discovered in their research is that location matters, a lot. As it states on the website: Children‚Äôs lives are shaped by the neighborhood they grow up in.
As part of the research, each county within each state was measured for its ‚Äúsocial mobility,‚Äù which is a term that explains the chances of someone advancing in economic status within their lifetime.
As they state on the website:
Put simply, proximity matters. Environment matters. Where you are born matters. Where you choose to stay matters.
The reason is very simple; within any given environment or ‚Äúsystem,‚Äù are a set of options. You can only make choices if you have options. Let me repeat that, you can only make choices if you have options.
This idea became starkly real to me when my wife and I moved from Orem, Utah, a county in the 90th percentile for upward social mobility, to Clemson, South Carolina where I began my PhD research in Organizational Psychology.
Shortly after moving to Clemson, my wife and I became foster parents of three children who were from a county bordering Clemson, Oconee, which happens to be in the 9% percentile of upward social mobility.
Put simply, if you‚Äôre born poor in Oconee County, your chances of breaking out of poverty are slim to none if you stay in Oconee County. As economic strategists and analyst, Mark Caine, has said, ‚ÄúThe first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself.‚Äù
It was clear when we got our children that they came from a different world than we did. They didn‚Äôt really know how to act in our environment, and we had to learn patience, empathy, and love beyond anything we‚Äôd previously been exposed to.
As they say, you can‚Äôt develop courage without the lion. You can‚Äôt develop empathy and love without being required to give it. Life, then, becomes the ultimate context for growth if you‚Äôre willing to put yourself in situations that force you out of your comfort zone.
Our three kids were incredibly limited by their prior environment. They didn‚Äôt have many options. They had parents who were generally high on drugs and didn‚Äôt have the capacity to provide a good life, let alone healthy food and a ride to school, to their children.
When our kids were placed in our care, their availability of options radically expanded. Because they had more and better options to choose from, they then had a different set of choices. In other words, their ability to exercise their ‚Äúfree-will‚Äù was expanded.
Again, you cannot make choices without options. And options are context-dependent, which means every environment or ‚Äúcontext‚Äù provides different options.
Because no two people have the same context, no two people have the same ‚Äúfree-will.‚Äù Instead, we all have what social psychologist, Jeffrey Reber, calls, ‚ÄúContextual Agency‚Äù ‚Äî which is to say, our ability to make choices is shaped by the context we are in.
For instance, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to read these words on your computer or smartphone if you were living 30+ years ago. The technology didn‚Äôt exist. You‚Äôd be reading on a newspaper or through some other means.
If you lived 150 years ago, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to fly across the world. That simply wasn‚Äôt an option given the situation. Thus, there are many things we take for granted, which are purely based on the situation we find ourselves.
According to Dr. Ellen Langer, a prominent Harvard psychologist:
But then, Langer takes this idea a step further by asking a key question and then providing the solution (emphasis mine):
It is our greatest responsibility to shape our individual and collective environments to match our values and ambitions. Or, as Dr. Marshall Goldmish said in his book, Triggers: Creating Behavior That Lasts ‚Äî Becoming the Person You Want to Be, ‚ÄúIf we do not create and control our environment, our environment creates and controls us.‚Äù
There is a brilliant book, Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization, Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright share their expansive research on different cultural groups in America.
They break-down ‚ÄúTribal Culture‚Äù into 5 levels, similar to how ‚ÄúIn Time‚Äù breaks-down Time Zones.
It‚Äôs important to note that the mindset and cultural values of the first three Cultural stages are highly ‚Äúindividualistic.‚Äù The emphasis is on the individual.
Me, me, me.
In order to get out of Stage 3 and into Stage 4, you need to start working with other people. As a friend of mine and near billionaire has said, ‚ÄúYou go from ‚ÄòI do it,‚Äô to ‚ÄòWe do it,‚Äô to ‚ÄòThey do it.‚Äô‚Äù
Most people never get beyond ‚ÄúI do it,‚Äù in their work. They never learn to delegate or collaborate. They have their own jobs and they get paid to do them.
Even most entrepreneurs and freelance creative people never get beyond Stage 3 thinking. Very few realize that the skills that get you out of Egypt are not the same skills that get you into the Promised Land (to use a Biblical analogy I learned from Dan Sullivan).
In other words, what got you here won‚Äôt get you there.
The thinking that got you here won‚Äôt get you there. As Albert Einstein has said, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.‚Äù Your thinking fundamentally needs to change as you upgrade environments, or else you won‚Äôt stay in those environments for long.
In the important book, The Lessons of History, famed historians Will and Ariel Durrant explain the key lessons they gleaned while studying the history of the world for several decades.
One of those key lessons is that, as a society has an increase in freedoms, they must simultaneously increase their intelligence to match the level of their freedom, or their freedom will eventually be lost.
This is one of the key themes influencing the rise and fall of nations. There is a surge of energy and enthusiasm which generally comes in the form of revolting against an existing system. There are a new law and order created and particular Stage 4 group band together and becomes a Stage 5 Phenom that changes the world.
However, according to the Durrants, when a social group experiences an intense increase of social freedoms ‚Äî wherein they have an abundance of freedom and choice ‚Äî their level of intelligence needs to increase to match their level of freedom, or else that freedom will be squandered, which is often the case.
Hence, America has a high potential of collapsing as the world superpower. The Durrants expect that the American fall will occur sometime in the next 200‚Äì300 years. However, they may not have accounted for globalization and the internet and exponential technologies.
The important point here is that, in order to thrive in a higher-level environment, your level of intelligence needs to rise to meet the new rules and demands of the higher-level environment. Otherwise, you won‚Äôt remain in that environment for long. The skills that got you out of the ghetto are not the skills that will allow you to thrive in New Grenich.
The rugged individualist mindset that got you out of the ghetto won‚Äôt get you very far among the super-wealthy, where connections and mutual trust are everything.
It‚Äôs been very interesting to observe these social principles within the walls of my own home. When we brought our beautiful children into our home, they had no comprehension of the ‚Äúrules‚Äù they needed to understand to thrive in our middle-class to upper-middle-class environment. They needed to be taught the rules. They‚Äôre still learning the rules.
And these rules aren‚Äôt meant to stamp out individuality. Rather, they are social and economic rules for not destroying themselves and going back into the ghetto, their principles for thriving and succeeding in society, in work, and with people. In other words, we attempt to teach correct principles and let them govern themselves.
At some point, it will be their choice to live what we taught them, to revert back to their native environment, or to advance beyond what we‚Äôve taught them.
Getting from one ‚ÄúTime Zone‚Äù to another isn‚Äôt necessarily easy. The movie, In Time, makes that abundantly clear.
The system isn‚Äôt set up for people to advance easily.
Social cultures make it even harder. By very nature, human beings are the social product of their environments. We develop bonds and those bonds keep us from wanting to advance ourselves and potentially destroy those bonds.
The hardest leap from one economic status to another is likely from Stage 1 to Stage 2 ‚Äî getting out of the ghettos and living from day-to-day to lower-middle-class where you‚Äôre living month-to-month.
The easiest jump is likely from Stage 2 to Stage 3 ‚Äî getting out of the victim mindset and developing a sense of responsibility for the outcomes you create in your life. One reason this isn‚Äôt that hard of a leap is that you can generally maintain the same peer and social groups, even though a disconnect will develop. You can generally get into Stage 3 by getting educated, reading some books, and having a little bit of personal ambition.
Without question, making any one of these jumps is difficult ‚Äî even going from lower-middle-class to middle-class.
The fastest way to make a jump is through proximity. You want to get yourself around people who are in higher-level systems and learn from them. You want to understand the laws and principles that generate their success. You need to understand how they operate socially. Because socially, there are fundamentally different rules at each stage for thriving. Again, the skills that got you out of Egypt will keep you stuck in the desert.
Dr. David Hawkins explains, ‚ÄúThe unconscious will only allow us to have what we believe we deserve. If we have a small view of ourselves, then what we deserve is poverty. And our unconscious will see to it that we have that actuality.‚Äù
Every culture has an embedded mindset and belief system. Hence, 95% of all behavior is unconscious and outsourced to the environment.
Your environment is the ultimate feedback loop, demonstrating where you are at the subconscious level. Your environment is a pretty accurate mirror reflecting back to you your subconscious belief system.
How you behave and treat other people is a reflection of your current situation. Different thinking, different behaviors, and relating differently to others will create a fundamentally different situation around you.
You can definitely jump from one Time Zone or Economic Status to another. However, you can never get out of one and stay in another on your own. You always need help from other people and other sources.
The most help is needed in getting people from Stage 1 to Stage 2. Radical interventions, extreme separation from family and friends, and economic help from outside parties is almost always required
Another extremely difficult leap is from Stage 3 thinking and cultures to Stage 4. In order to make this leap, you have to unlearn all of the rules that made you relatively successful in the first place. You have to put off your rugged individuality and begin thinking much, much bigger. You need to realize that individuality can actually be a poison. As Dr. David Hawkins explains in his book, LETTING GO, ‚ÄúIt is the illusion of individuality that is the origin of all suffering.‚Äù
Instead of seeing yourself as a lone individual, you recognize yourself as a single factor within a larger system. You realize that your possibilities are shaped by context and that self-made is an illusion. Rather than trying to see what you can do alone, you now recognize that you could go 100X further and faster by collaborating with other people.
According to Harvard psychologist, Robert Kegan, only 8% of the population reaches this level of ‚Äúconscious evolution,‚Äù wherein they move from an individual to a part of a collective. But not just any collective. You become a part of collaborative and synergistic groups where highly creative and innovative thinking occurs. This is where ‚Äúmission‚Äù and the desire to do real good happens ‚Äî where all parties are completely secure in their own ability to survive and take care of their base needs. Abundance, giving, creativity, gratitude, and growth are the focus of these groups.
Always learning and upgrading.
The third most difficult leap is from Stage 4 to Stage 5. This is basically going from the top 3‚Äì5% of the population to the top 1%, and more accurately, the 1% of the 1% ‚Äî Those who are the best in the world at what they do, and are the highest paid.
This is equivalent to going from college to professional athletics. It‚Äôs much easier to go from High School (Stage 3) to College (Stage 4), but much much harder going from Stage 4 to Stage 5.
Making any of these jumps is completely possible.
Perhaps the most fundamental decision any person can ever make is this one:
That is the most fundamental decision you can make about life as a human being. It is what some would call a ‚Äúwatershed issue‚Äù ‚Äî whichever side of the equation you pick will put you down a course that will influence all of your other decisions, mindsets, and beliefs.
Do you believe you can choose what you become?
Or do you believe your course is set for you at birth?
Do you ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù yourself or do you ‚Äúcreate‚Äù yourself?
You can‚Äôt change nature.... or, nature is change....Which side of the coin do you choose?
Whichever perspective you choose, your brain will go about finding any and all information it can to support that bias. As Dan Sullivan has said, ‚ÄúYour eyes can only see and your ears can only hear what your brain is looking for.‚Äù Psychologists call this ‚Äúselective attention.‚Äù
What you focus on expands.
You see what you believe is real ‚Äî and then it becomes real for you in a self-fulfilling prophecy. As Dr. Stephen Covey said, ‚ÄúYou see the world, not as it is, but as you‚Äôve been conditioned to see it.‚Äù
Making this shift starts by recognizing that for quite a while, you‚Äôve been going through the motions. Your thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and even desires are the product of your environment.
Thanks to a global world that makes information abundant, it isn‚Äôt hard to become exposed to other ways of life. However, you must realize quickly that most of the information online is complete trash. Which is why Basecamp Founder, Jason Fried, has said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty oblivious to a lot of things intentionally. I don‚Äôt want to be influenced that much.‚Äù
Once you begin upgrading your mindset and environment, and once your priorities and goals are clear ‚Äî then you don‚Äôt want to be swayed or distracted by most of the low-level information out there.
You must realize that most of the information produced is from Stage 2 and Stage 3 cultures. Therefore, if you consume that level of information, then those mindsets will be embedded into your subconscious thinking.
People in Stage 4 and Stage 5 cultures do not consume the same information as do people in Stage 2 and 3 cultures. For example, I recently spoke at a mastermind done by Bo Eason, who used to be a professional football player and is now a very highly paid public speaker.
Bo‚Äôs son, Axel, intends on being the first person to go pro in both football and basketball. Therefore, Bo doesn‚Äôt allow Axel to watch the NFL on public television. According to Bo, sports on TV is made for fans and consumers, not the players.
‚ÄúThe pro‚Äôs don‚Äôt want that crap,‚Äù Bo told me.
Pro‚Äôs study film, practice, and play the game.
When you‚Äôre a real pro, you don‚Äôt consume how fans consume. You do the work. You‚Äôre too busy creating and learning and growing and living your life.
Are you a fan or a pro?
Are you a consumer or creator?
A key strategy for making any jump is to, ‚ÄúAssume the feeling of your wish fulfilled,‚Äù meaning, you assume the posture, attitude, and emotions of the people operating at the higher level.
You affirm to yourself who you are and then operate from that affirmation. This may sound like ‚Äúacting as if,‚Äù and it actually is.
But it‚Äôs important to realize that we are always ‚Äúacting‚Äù in a role. All of life is acting. In every situation, you are assuming a character. You‚Äôre playing a role based on the other people around you. In some situations, your role may be an employee, while in others it may be a parent, or child, or friend.
In all cases, you are acting a part.
You can change your role.
You can change the stage.
You can choose to be different. But it must start in your state of being. Rather than operating subconsciously as the majority of people do, you must make a conscious decision about who you intend to be and where you intend to go. You must then BEHAVE from that decision. When you act from that decision, then you create the outcomes you are seeking. You will become the person you intend to be, rather than the person your circumstances led you to be.
I‚Äôve created a cheat sheet for putting yourself into a PEAK-STATE, immediately. You follow this daily, your life will change very quickly.
Get the cheat sheet here!

So no matter how pointless or trivial the task, we still feel productive.
While your brain may be sweating from the sheer challenge of it all, it doesn‚Äôt mean that what you‚Äôre doing is automatically the best use of your time.
Your best use of time is always going to be adding value. Sometimes that‚Äôs code, sometimes not.
If you‚Äôre an entrepreneur or single founder, your job is to add value to your customers lives. If you‚Äôre employed or want to be, your job is to add value to your company, and the company‚Äôs customers.
Nothing in life will move you forward, faster, than consistent prioritization of things that add the most value for others (and for yourself.)
This is what separates the top performers from everyone else, the highest paid from the resentful, the productive and impactful from the overworked.
Don‚Äôt be fooled by what you see on social media. The answer is not 18 hour days and 100 hour weeks. The hustle never stops!
You‚Äôll sleep when you‚Äôre dead, right?
Well, I like sleeping. And I like clocking into work, getting a lot done, getting paid well for it, and leaving work at work. I like having the free time to write and work on my own stuff.
I‚Äôm afforded these ‚Äúluxuries‚Äù (you know, like a work-life balance) because my company trusts me. I‚Äôm far from a world-class developer. In fact, I‚Äôm a self-taught programmer and I didn‚Äôt start coding seriously until my late 20's.
But I‚Äôve built up a track record of getting the stuff done that adds value for other people and the organization. I‚Äôve achieved this through systems and techniques anyone can learn.
We all have a never-ending list of things we have to do.
But they‚Äôre only a few key things that provide the most value and contribution, more than the rest of your list combined.
And we all have a few hours each day when our energy levels and circadian rhythm line up and we‚Äôre truly engaged (or least, can be truly engaged). The time of day and length will vary, but we all have it in us.
Spend your most valuable time on your most valuable activities and you‚Äôll change the trajectory of your life.
You don‚Äôt have to be the best in the world.
But if you‚Äôre in the top 10% of developers in your organization or city, or in the top 10% of job candidates, or in the top 10% of freelancers on Upwork, then you‚Äôre going to do pretty well.
You‚Äôll know when you‚Äôre in the top 10% because the rewards will come to you. The rewards are both internal (fulfillment in your career, free time for family) and external (recognition, promotions, and financial rewards).
Eat That Frog: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time is a book by Brian Tracy that is loaded with simple and practical productivity advice.
It‚Äôs only about 120 pages but its dense with actionable insights and wisdom. Brian Tracy has been a pillar in the self-improvement field for decades, still going strong at 74 years old.
It‚Äôs a little outdated (well, at least my copy published in 2007.)
Blackberries get mentioned a lot, and it can get cheesy and repetitive. Some of it can sound a little old-school and hardline, like an old grandpa yelling clicheÃÅs at you.
But the main ideas are sound. Most have worked really well for me.
All self-help and productivity advice ultimately boils down to the same thing: A little planning. Prioritization. Taking action on the hard stuff. Procrastinating on the stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter. Finishing.
That‚Äôs it. It doesn‚Äôt need to be more complicated than that.
When you get into the habit of doing your most difficult task before you do anything else, you become a person of action and discipline.
Your identity changes from cog in the wheel to engine that moves the ship forward.
Not just any difficult task. There are a lot of difficult things we can fill our day with. Difficult does not always equate to important or greatest positive impact.
If you‚Äôre unsure what that means, the keyword is procrastination.
You‚Äôre likely to procrastinate because of fear. Fear is a great sign that this thing you have to do is an important frog.
It can be the fear of failing or looking stupid.
You don‚Äôt start the online Computer Science 101 course because you‚Äôre scared it‚Äôs going to be too complicated to understand.
As a junior developer, you don‚Äôt take on projects that are just slightly out of your comfort zone. It‚Äôs safer to work on what you already know.
It‚Äôs also the fear of success.
What if your career actually takes off and they start giving you more responsibility and money? Who wants that?!
The fear of success is often worse than the fear of failure. It‚Äôs insidious because it‚Äôs not obvious that people would be scared of achieving more. But the Jonah complex is real and many talented men and women are stopped short of their true excellence because of it.
So we procrastinate on real contribution. We procrastinate on finishing and showing our work.
Instead, we keep busy doing stuff that ‚Äúshould‚Äù get done, and the stuff we‚Äôre told to do, in order to avoid looking a big, ugly frog in the face.
Tadpoles are helpless babies that aren‚Äôt frogs. They‚Äôre easy to kill. Killing tadpoles is a mindless activity that doesn‚Äôt impress anyone.
Eat the biggest, nastiest frog you‚Äôve ever seen and now you have something to be proud of.
If you‚Äôre learning to code, your frog is starting and finishing an online course. Your frog is repeating the modules you don‚Äôt understand until you do. Your frog is doing your code camp assignments with focus and intention.
If you want to get hired, then your frog is building things. There is no better way to learn to code and get hired than building stuff, plain and simple.
Your frog is not organizing your bookmarks or polishing your Linkedin profile. Your frog is not posting to forums, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and Facebook groups. These are tadpoles. These things are mindless and easy.
If you want to launch a side project that‚Äôs been kicking around in your head for a while, then writing code is your frog. Launching is your frog. Shutting it down after it‚Äôs clear that nobody is interested? A big frog.
Your frog is not never-ending market research or reading about how other people launched their side projects. Your frog is most definitely not tweeting about how hard you‚Äôre ‚Äúhustling.‚Äù
You may already know what your frogs are, but take some time to do the exercises below. A few minutes of reflection is worth a hundred times more than hours of mindless busy work.
When you realize importance of deciding, starting, and finishing the things that will have the greatest impact on your life, career and organization, then you‚Äôre going to do better than 90% of the people out there.
Goals and goal-setting have fallen out of favor these days. Instead, we‚Äôre all about systems, habits, and daily practice.
I agree because goals can be dangerous. Goals focus on the outcome, which we don‚Äôt control.
If you don‚Äôt reach your goal, it can make you feel like a complete failure. Or you may end up so obsessed with the outcome that you neglect to do any real work towards achieving it. The term ‚Äúwantrepreneur‚Äù comes to mind.
Systems are better because we have control over our systems. We can measure ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù with a system because every day we either do it or we don‚Äôt. Focus is on the daily process, not the eventual outcome.
Frog eating is a system. When you organize the things you have to do in order of impact, plan ahead, and then focus on the most important tasks until they‚Äôre done, every day, that‚Äôs a system.
But you need some idea where to aim your energy. Without some clarity, all of the effort we put into our systems can go to waste.
So let‚Äôs pretend goals are cool for a second. Use the present tense with a positive voice. Be specific. You want clarity because vague, general goals aren‚Äôt helpful.
Don‚Äôt write ‚ÄúLearn to code.‚Äù A specific and achievable goal would be ‚ÄúI am an experienced front-end developer who has finished the freeCodeCamp curriculum and built three small side projects for my portfolio.‚Äù
‚ÄúGet a new job‚Äù is not a good goal. Instead, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm earning 50% more than my current salary, working my dream job at X company.‚Äù
Write out every single thing, large and small, that would be required to achieve your goal. Add in all of your obligations, the stuff you have to do anyway.
This exercise of listing everything has a few benefits.
First, this gives you a master list. Every new thing that comes your way, or that you think of, should be added to your master list. That doesn‚Äôt mean you have to do it. It just means you get it out of your head so you stop worrying about it.
Next, working from a list is also great way to be more productive. (Chapter 2 ‚Äî Plan Everyday in Advance)
When you have a big list, you can pick off the big frogs and get started immediately. When you start your day without knowing what to work on, it becomes much easier to procrastinate on doing anything at all.
Plus, breaking down the huge, overwhelming tasks into actionable steps is the only way you‚Äôre going to get started on them. (Chapter 18 ‚Äî Slice and Dice the Task)
Lastly, it gives you clarity.
You can ‚ÄúLearn React,‚Äù an admirable accomplishment for any budding front-end developer. But if it has nothing to do with your goals at this point in your life, then your time is better spent elsewhere.
Recognizing the difference between high-value and low-value activities is the core of Eat That Frog. It‚Äôs the core of most productivity advice.
If you learn only one thing from this post, I hope it‚Äôs the ability to separate true contribution and value from everything else that doesn‚Äôt really matter.
This advice is so important that I had to put it first, even though it‚Äôs not from Eat That Frog. It comes from a great post by Justin Jackson.
If something you‚Äôre doing is working, do more of it. Recognize when you have a hit on your hands.
If your side project is growing without much effort, keep working on it. Don‚Äôt start on some new brain fart of an idea.
If you‚Äôre doing something for your career that is getting recognized, like giving talks at conferences, do more of it.
If people love what you write, write more.
It‚Äôs rare to strike gold. So when you do, put more of your time and energy into mining that precious vein, and eliminate everything that doesn‚Äôt add to its success.
If you haven‚Äôt struck gold yet, that‚Äôs OK.
There‚Äôs work to be done before opportunity can even show up. Your chances increase when you‚Äôre working on high impact activities, not low value nonsense.
We can give weight to each activity using the ABCDE method.
Think about how much each item moves you towards your goal. Think about the short-term and long-term consequences of doing or not doing each thing on your list.
Let‚Äôs stick with the ‚ÄúLand your dream job‚Äù goal.
Applying to jobs by submitting your resume everywhere might seem like the obvious A activity, but there are bigger impact ways to achieve this goal.
Spend time researching the companies you would love to work for. Get to know everything about them, as if you already work there. Connect with people who do work there. Find the decision makers. Take a recruiter out to lunch. Spend time writing a thoughtful cover letter. Read great books on getting hired like ‚ÄúWhat Color is Your Parachute?‚Äù Spend lots of time thinking about how you can contribute and add value on day one.
Strive to be in the top 10% of candidates and stop doing what 90% of people do. Eliminate the shotgun strategy of blindly uploading your resume to any and every available job opening. Your chances are so much higher with an intentional, laser-focused approach.
The best way to figure out how you can add value, especially if you‚Äôre employed or doing work for somebody, is to ask. Have a conversation about it.
If you did the exercises above, you should have a pretty big list of things to do.
Now accept that you‚Äôre never going to do it all. There‚Äôs never enough time and there never will be. But your goal is not to become the best ‚Äúchecker of lists.‚Äù
80% of your results will come from 20%, maybe less, of the items on your list. Out of all your frogs, which one (three at most) is going to have the biggest impact on your life?
You don‚Äôt have control over a company hiring you. You don‚Äôt have control over getting a raise. You don‚Äôt have control over how the market responds to your startup or side project.
What you do have control over is how many big, ugly frogs you can eat in a day.
You have control of continuous elimination and delegation of things that don‚Äôt add value.
You have control of committing to your routine, day after day, to become a person of action.
We‚Äôre not trying to be busy for 18 hours a day here. We just want to commit those few precious hours, when our ability to concentrate and focus is highest, on our most important and difficult things.
For most people, it‚Äôs in morning before the distractions of the day claw at your time.
Learning to code is huge mountain to climb for beginners, especially if you have a limited amount of time. But when you break it down into actionable steps, you can form a daily system.
As you get more experienced, the contents of each hour will change, but the system remains the same.
My frog, as far as personal projects go, is writing on Medium and launching codetip.com.
I want to produce practical and useful content that you can implement to help your career. My fear is that I‚Äôll spend days writing something that no one will read or care about.
So I procrastinate. That is, until I toughen up and eat the frog.
My best writing comes in the morning when I open my laptop and start writing. I block all my distracting websites, put my phone in another room, start a Pomodoro timer, then write.
I start writing even when I have nothing to say, or if my thoughts are all over the place. These don‚Äôt make for good articles. But I keep taking bites of this big, nasty frog until the good stuff gets teased out.
The most productive code I write at my job happens the same way.
I get into the office early, turn off the distractions, and start working on the hardest, most difficult thing on my list. This thing is important to the company and other stakeholders, like a new feature, performance optimization, or fixing a major defect. I add value by helping the people above me look good.
Most days, I only have the stomach to eat these frogs for a few hours before I get tired.
But in those few, highly-focused hours, I add more value in a day than I would in a week if I were jumping around between a bunch of unimportant things without any intention.
The rest of the day is spent on tadpoles like responding to Slack and emails, fixing minor bugs, and planning work for tomorrow. These activities have some impact and require some effort.
The things I absolutely avoid at work are mindless activities that have zero impact on my company or career, like browsing Hacker News, Reddit, or social media.
I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt succumb to these entertaining temptations at times. I just do everything in my power to start my day with my most difficult tasks and get as far along on those as I can.
Creative people, especially the ones with an entrepreneurial trait, are notorious for starting projects and not finishing them. The next idea comes. It‚Äôs newer and shinier, so we chase that.
Our hard drives are a wasteland of ideas, articles, and half finished apps that seemed like good opportunities at the time. How‚Äôs that novel coming along, Brian?
When you don‚Äôt finish stuff, when you don‚Äôt release it out into the public, you‚Äôll never reach the top 10% of anything. You might as well have not started in the first place.
I get that some ideas and projects are not worth finishing. I get that there‚Äôs an art of knowing when to quit. I get that there‚Äôs a obsession with struggling.
But I think most of the time we quit when we‚Äôre a few short feet from gold.
You have to finish because that‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôre going to get the feedback you need to decide if what you‚Äôre doing is adding value.
Don‚Äôt start learning Android development because learning JavaScript got too hard. Don‚Äôt dive into machine learning because Android development got too hard, and heck, that sounds like the hot new thing, so yeah, I‚Äôll just do that!
Don‚Äôt give up on your side project because you couldn‚Äôt figure out how to join two database tables.
Don‚Äôt start writing the next article before you finish the last one. Don‚Äôt start the next project unless you finish the the one you‚Äôre working on now.
If this is you, then tomorrow‚Äôs frog is finishing. Not eight hours starting something new.
Commit to thirty minutes, or an hour, whatever you need to finish your frog.
Finish it, launch it, and walk away.

‚ÄúTo version control, silly.‚Äù
Alright, alright, I‚Äôm not being too helpful, yet. Here‚Äôs the basic idea: As projects get too large, with too many contributors, it gets impossible to track who did what and when. Did someone introduce a change that broke the entire system? How do you figure out what that change was? How do you go back to how things were before? Back to the unbroken wonderland?
I‚Äôll take it a step further ‚Äî say not a project with many contributors, just a small project with you as the creator, maintainer and distributor: You create a new feature for this project, which introduces subtle bugs you find out later. You don‚Äôt remember what changes you made to the existing code base to create this new feature. Problem?
The answer to all these problems is versioning! Having versions for everything you‚Äôve coded ensures you know who made the changes, what changes and exactly where, since the beginning of the project!
And now, I invite you to stop thinking of (g)it as a blackbox, open it up and find out what treasures await. Figure out how Git works, and you‚Äôll never again have a problem making things work. Once you‚Äôre through this, I promise you‚Äôll realise the folly of doing what the XKCD comic above says. That is exactly what versioning is trying to prevent.
I am assuming you know the basic commands in Git, or have heard about them and used them at least once. If not, here‚Äôs a basic vocabulary to help you get started.
Repository: a place for storing things. With Git, this means your code folder
head: A ‚Äúpointer‚Äù to the latest code you were working on
add: An action to ask Git to track a file
commit: An action to save the current state ‚Äî such that one can revisit this state if needed
remote: A repository that isn‚Äôt local. Can be in another folder or in the cloud (for example: Github): helps other people to easily collaborate, as they don‚Äôt have to get a copy from your system ‚Äî they can just get it from the cloud. Also, ensures you have a backup in case you break your laptop
pull: An action to get updated code from the remote
push: An action to send updated code to the remote
merge: An action to combine two different versions of code
status: Displays information about current repository status
Introducing the magic controlled by a hidden folder: .git/
In every git repository, you‚Äôll see something like this
This is how Git controls and manages your entire project. We will go into all the important bits, one by one.
Git consists of 3 parts: the object store, the index and the working directory.
This is how Git stores everything internally. For every file in your project that you add, Git generates a hash for the file and stores the file under that hash. For example, if I now create a helloworld file and do git add helloworld (which is telling Git to add the file called helloworld to the git object store), I get something like this:
A new object has been generated! For those interesting in going under the hood, Git internally uses the hash-object command like so:
Yes, it‚Äôs the same hash we see under the objects folder. Why the subdirectory with the first two characters of the hash? It makes searching faster.
Then, Git creates an object with the name as the above hash, compresses our given file and stores it there. Hence, you can also actually see the contents of the object!
This is all under the hood. You‚Äôd never use cat-file in day to day adds. You‚Äôll simply add, and let Git handle the rest.
That‚Äôs our first Git command, done and dusted.
git add creates a hash, compresses the file and adds the compressed object to the object store.
As the name suggests, this is where you work. All files you create and edit are in the working directory. I created a new file, byeworld and ran git status:
Untracked files are files in the working directory we haven‚Äôt asked git to manage.
Had there been nothing we had done in the working directory, we‚Äôd get the following message:
which I‚Äôm pretty sure you understand now. Ignore the branch and commit for now. The key is, the working tree(directory) is clean.
This is the core of Git. Also known as the staging area. The index stores the mapping of files to the objects in the object store. This is where the commits come in. The best way to see this is to test it out!
Let us commit our addition of the file helloworld
Back to our tree:
Ah, interesting! We have 2 new objects in our object store, and some stuff we don‚Äôt understand yet in the logs and refs. Going back to our friend cat-file:
As you can guess, the first object is the commit metadata: who did what and why, with a tree. The second object, is the actual tree. If you understand unix file system, you‚Äôll know exactly what this is.
The tree in Git corresponds to the Git file system. Everything is either a tree (directory) or a blob (file) and with each commit, Git stores the tree information as well, to tell itself: this is how the working directory should look at this point. Note that the tree points to a specific object of each file it contains (the hash).
It‚Äôs time to talk about branches! Our first commit added some other stuff to .git/ as well. Our interest is now in .git/refs/heads/master:
Here‚Äôs what you need to know about branches:
Eh, what? I like to think of branches as a fork in your code. You want to make some changes, but you don‚Äôt want to break things. You decide to have a stronger demarcation than the commit log, and that‚Äôs where branches come in. master is the default branch, also used as the de-facto production branch. Hence, the creation of the above file. As you can guess by the contents of the file, it points to our first commit. Hence, it‚Äôs a pointer to a commit.
Let‚Äôs explore this further. Say, I create a new branch:
There we have it, a new branch! As you can guess, a new entry must have been added to .git/refs/heads/ and since there is no extra commit, it should point to our first commit as well, just like master.
Yup, exactly! Now, remember byeworld? That file was still untracked, so no matter what branch you shift to, that file would always be there. Say, I want to switch to this branch now, so I‚Äôll checkout the branch, like a smokeshow.
Now, under the hood, Git would change all contents of the working directory to match the content pointed by the branch commit. For now, since this is exactly the same as master, it looks the same.
I add and commit the byeworld file.
What do you expect to change in the objects folder?
What do you expect to change in the refs/heads folder?
Think about this before moving forward.
3 new objects ‚Äî 1 for add, 2 for commit! Makes sense? What do you think the objects contain?
The last part of the picture is: how does this commit metadata work with the previous commit metadata(s). Well, cat-file!
Do you see it in bold? The parent pointer! And it‚Äôs exactly how you thought about it ‚Äî a linked list, linking the commits together!
And do you see the branch implementation? It points to a commit, the latest one we did after checking out! Of course, the master should still be pointing to the helloworld commit, right?
Alright, we have been through a lot, let‚Äôs summarise it up to here.
Git works with objects ‚Äî compressed versions of files you‚Äôre asking Git to track.
Each object has an ID (a hash generated by Git based on contents of the file).
Every time you add a file, Git adds a new object to the object store. This is exactly why you can‚Äôt deal with very large files in Git ‚Äî it stores the entire file each time you add changes, not the diff (contrary to popular belief).
Every commit creates 2 objects:
Branches are pointers to commit metadata objects, all stored in .git/refs/heads
That‚Äôs all for the understanding behind the scenes! In the next part, we‚Äôll go through some of the Git actions that give people nightmares:
reset, merge, pull, push, fetch and how they modify the internal structure in .git/.

Getting more work done is about knowing what to do, when to do it, and how to get it done in the shortest possible time to maximise the little time you have everyday.
It means means choosing tasks that strategically align with your work objectives.
It‚Äôs the ratio between input and output.
What are the most important actions you can take today that will get your closer to your work goals in the shortest possible time?
Imagine the repercussions of choosing to do urgent (but not important) tasks instead of focusing on important actions.
‚ÄúThe secret to mastering your time is to systematically focus on importance and suppress urgency.‚Äù
Oliver Emberton said that.
It‚Äôs profound and so true.
Urgency wrecks productivity.
Urgent but unimportant tasks are major distractions.
In 1954, former U.S President Dwight D. Eisenhower said,
‚ÄúI have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.‚Äù
Separating important tasks from urgent ones is a problem for many people.
The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.
Urgent tasks put us into constant ‚Äúreply mode.‚Äù
They are distractions.
Important work are tasks we have planned that move goals.
Our brains are so drawn to urgency that we choose ‚Äúobjectively worse options over objectively better (important) options.
To maximise time and do more focused work, question your choices constantly, and develop the ability to watch your mind as it gets whipped up by sudden requests.
When a task you have not planned to do falls onto your plate, ask yourself:
‚ÄúIs this really important?‚Äù
And then think about not only how, but when, to best handle it.
When you try to tackle too many tasks everyday, you will be overwhelmed and achieve less.
When everything is important, you will be tempted to skillfully juggle multiple priorities at the same time, and your productivity suffers in the process.
It pays to prioritise your tasks and work on the most important ones first thing in the morning, when you are most active.
‚ÄúEven if everything on your plate is supposed to be equally important, you still need a way to break down which ones you spend your time on, and how you slice up your time,‚Äù says Alan Henry of Lifehacker
Whenever you are faced with a lot to do, take a step back to recognise the rushed mindset and its consequences.
Instead of rushing to get them done at the same time, start by asking yourself:
‚ÄúIs this really important?‚Äù
And then think about not only how, but when, to best handle it.
Ultimately, the goal should be to question your choices constantly, and to develop the ability to recognise tasks that just distract you from your real work.
Interruptions like notifications, loud noises, social media, someone knocking on your door, and switching to check emails every now and then, break your flow.
They interrupt your concentration.
They‚Äôre just enough to pull your focus away and make you have to start over.
Anytime you are pulled away from your tasks, it takes time to readjust to them when you jump back in ‚Äî up to 25 minutes in many cases.
Your life keeps diminishing while you waste your time feeding your distractions.
Successful people prioritise! They focus! They disconnect from everything else to get tasks done.
Beware of deceptive time-wasting activities that disguise themselves as work; Lengthy discussions with colleagues, long meetings and treating other people‚Äôs work as ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù when you should be concentrating on your high-value work.
Writing in the first century, Seneca was surprised by how little people seemed to value their lives as they were living them ‚Äî how busy, terribly busy, everyone seemed to be, and wasteful of their time.
He noticed how even wealthy people hustled their lives along, ruing their fortune, anticipating a time in the future when they would rest.
‚ÄúLife is long if you know how to use it,‚Äù he counselled.
Take control of your time and start distributing it right.
Start by reviewing your daily routine.
Track your daily activities for some time to clearly see where your time is being spent. Meetings, phone calls, emails, notifications, small chats, and many other distractions are constantly splitting your attention.
Record ALL your appointments, deadlines, and everything in-between.Analyse the actual time you spend on each activity with what you think is the best amount for each.
Schedule the heck out of your days. Schedule everything in advance.
Make a plan and know what‚Äôs going on each day.
This helps you figure out how you‚Äôre spending your time
Notice where time leaks, then declutter your routine.
Busy does not necessarily means productive.
Busy work makes you feel like you are moving quickly and being productive in the process. But in effect, you are not.
If you took time to measure your work, you will be surprised at how little valuable work you are doing.
Oliver Burkeman of BBC writes, ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre busy, you‚Äôre more likely to make poor time-management choices ‚Äî taking on commitments you can‚Äôt handle, or prioritising trifling tasks over crucial ones. A vicious spiral kicks in: your feelings of busyness leave you even busier than before.‚Äù
If you start your day by answering emails. You could get sucked into answering questions, replying to every email, and advancing the cause of other people‚Äôs actions.
Be proactive about your emails.
Don‚Äôt get caught up in reactive mode.
‚ÄúMost of us have no problem with being busy, but we‚Äôre often busy on the wrong things,‚Äù says Angie Morgan, co-author of Spark: How to Lead Yourself and Others to Greater Success. ‚ÄúYou could spend nine to five just emailing, but that‚Äôs not driving results or moving you toward longer, bigger goals. When people say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so busy,‚Äô it really means, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a poor planner,‚Äô or, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know how to prioritise or delegate.‚Äù
Adopt the ‚Äúone thing‚Äù approach.
Make the hard choices and work on your most important priorities instead of responding to urgent tasks.
Your time is limited. Doing everything is not an option.
Set a very clear intention of how your day will go the next morning, particularly in the beginning, the night before.
Visualising this intention and writing it down into your schedule can make it happen more automatically in the morning without wasting time.
Planning tomorrow today is a powerful habit that changes everyday.
It‚Äôs a system that can completely changes how you work:
You could double your efficiency with this simple process/habit.
On any given day, assume that you can only accomplish one big thing, three medium things, and five small things, and narrow down your to-do list to those nine items.
This means that your daily schedule will feature:
1. One very important task;
2. Three tasks of medium importance
3. Five little things
Of course, this can be flexible, depending on important actions you need to take to advance your work goals.
A daily priority list gives you a great roadmap to follow so that you don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed and don‚Äôt have to waste time thinking about what needs done.
I use a combination of these methods to get through the day depending on how much work I have to get through.
As you practice being ruthless with your to-do, you‚Äôll find it gets easier and you‚Äôll be able to pick the right method at the right time.

But here‚Äôs something most people don‚Äôt know about him: He was also a world-class safecracker.
In the 1940s, in the New Mexico Desert, Feynman was bored while working on the Manhattan project that would birth the atomic bomb. Naturally, then, he decided to occupy himself by pulling pranks on his colleagues.
Knowing that most of them were relatively careless when dealing with the safes that stored top secret documents ‚Äî whether forgetting to lock them, or leaving them on factory settings, or choosing obvious dates as their codes ‚Äî he began leaving notes in the place of their work like:
Eventually, he got so good at it that the Colonel in charge of his unit began advising people that if Feynman had been anywhere near their safe, it was a part of their job to change their combination lock once more.
This story is one of many stories Feynman tells in his autobiography Surely, You‚Äôre Joking Mr. Feynman!, where his playful nature gets the better out of both him and his attention.
One of the things I‚Äôve personally always admired about Feynman is that he was so deeply curious about things that the only purpose behind what he decided to commit himself to was what he found interesting.
He had general aims, I‚Äôm sure, and given the complexity of the work he put out, he was obviously an insanely focused person, but the orienting impulse that guided him was beyond goals and simple ambitions. He was far more interested in getting somewhere past the known.
Goals as orientation are common in almost all of our pursuits. We look ahead, predict what may make us happy in the future, and we then narrow down towards something specific. But what if that‚Äôs not the way?
When dealing with the future, an orientation of some sort ‚Äî however vague or specific ‚Äî is necessary. If we didn‚Äôt have one, we would be entirely shaped by the current of luck and randomness, which isn‚Äôt always a blessing.
To exercise some semblance of agency over our lives, then, we often resort to goal-setting. We are taught to do so early on so that we can keep up with the world around us. Later, corporations, for example, even have acronyms, like SMART goals, that have us continuing to do so.
Now, whether we are setting SMART goals or personal ones under our own framework (or no framework), the one thing that they have in common is that they are relatively concrete. You want to be married by 30, earn an executive position by 40, and be retired by 50. That‚Äôs how they usually go.
For the most part, my inclination is to say that having these is better than not having any, and certain people have a genetic disposition to find satisfaction in specific accomplishment more so than others, but there are also problems that come with spending an entire life living goal to goal.
For one, it attempts to predict an unpredictable future. Who is to say that what you want tomorrow or the year after is the same thing you want right now? More critically, what if what you want right now isn‚Äôt even oriented in the right direction over the long-term and you‚Äôre actually going the wrong way? Life changes, we change, and none of this is evident without hindsight.
Secondly, and just as importantly, it creates an anchor: You bind your expectations of happiness and contentment onto something so singular that you often forget that other things in your life are capable of adding just as much joy to your experience than the thing you‚Äôre so fixated on.
Everybody knows that the ultimate reward is the process, not the goal, but what we forget is that the virtue of even having goals makes it very hard to stay honest to a process that often deviates day to day.
This creates a strange tension: On one end, goals of some sort are necessary, and giving the future its due attention is the right thing to do; on the other hand, the act of creating these goals and worshiping them, as we often do, leads to a conflict that we can‚Äôt easily get away from.
To solve this tension, we have to move towards something more nebulous.
The really fascinating, and even admirable, thing about Feynman was that if he ever had a goal, it was simply this: to learn as much as possible in any direction that his innate curiosity took him.
For brief periods of his time, working on one problem or the other, he may have had more specific goals, sure, and he certainly took the time to focus on them as he needed without distractions. But broadly, his orientation was pointed towards the most interesting thing he could find.
The pursuit of interestingness, I think, solves the predicament that is inherent in goal-setting. It‚Äôs vague and nebulous enough to be honest about the unpredictability of the future, without being hopelessly lost in the chaos of pure luck and randomness.
Throughout life, we all see things, learn things, and pursue things. This process is different for each of us, but as we do so, we also develop a very strong intuition of what we, personally, find fascinating about the world ‚Äî something that aligns with our deeper nature while respecting that we change over time as human beings, letting us adapt accordingly.
Interestingness isn‚Äôt hedonism or materialism or the chase of anything new and shiny that seeks to distract us. It‚Äôs deeper than that. It‚Äôs taking on that random project you had no plan to take on because you have a feeling that you might just learn something you didn‚Äôt know about yourself. It‚Äôs seeing a person you just met not as a potential partner or someone who can do something for you but simply as an individual who may open up a new, unknown, and unique dimension in your life.
The great thing about pursuing this kind of interestingness is that it has a far shorter feedback loop than specific goals. You keep doing something for as long as it‚Äôs interesting, but if you were mistaken about your initial impulse, you move on, without too much lost.
Naturally, not everything or everyone is interesting all the time, but generally speaking, if something maintains its interest over a period of time, it‚Äôs likely worth dedicating some energy to.
By making interestingness the goal, you give your actual goals a fluidity, one that can better accommodate new information. This also better amalgamates the goal with the process, rather than the goal being a distinct thing that battles to keep your attention off of the process.
More than anything, however, the pursuit of interestingness honors a simple truth about the human experience: The best things in life are by-products. They come when they come, as you commit yourself honestly to a process, not when you spend time striving for imagined perfection.
The future demands attention, and while focusing all of our energy on it is self-defeating, we do need to be intentional about directing some of our effort towards it as we orient ourselves in the world.
Goals are one way to do that. They give us a way to make concrete what is otherwise uncertain so that we can make progress without losing ourselves to anxiety. The problem, however, is that they often mistake what exists to provide orientation as a thing of value in itself.
The best way out of this trap is to pursue what is interesting ‚Äî to use our intuition for what it is that we find novel in this world to make the process and the goal one and the same thing; to continually update our sense of what is worth pursuing without being confined to false certainty.
Interestingness seeks out the riddle of life. It gives us a reason to turn the next page, to see the next scene, to give form to the unknown.
Feynman embodied this, but he also once said something that captures what it is that differentiates such a pursuit from mere goals and certainties:
Goals, incorrectly, assume that we already know what it is that we want. Interestingness is more humble. It makes up its mind as it moves, slowly blowing from one thing to another, until it eventually grasps something that lies beyond prediction.
Looking ahead, imagining scenarios that we think may be worth our time, has a place, but at the end of the day, what is most relevant is unfolding around us right now, and it doesn‚Äôt care what we thought about it yesterday.

I‚Äôve met enough people who learned little from their own stupidity.
We all know these people. In fact, we probably are these people. You know why? It‚Äôs damned hard to learn from your mistakes. I‚Äôve never met someone who actually enjoyed failing.
Let‚Äôs be honest, no one likes to make mistakes, and lose their time, energy, or money. So that‚Äôs why we need to make an effort to learn from the things that we wish we didn‚Äôt do. The father of functional philosophy and pragmatist philosophy, John Dewey, made that point obvious:
Learning from your mistakes does not happen automatically ‚Äî it requires thinking and reflection. So here‚Äôs my reflection on the lessons I learned from the mistakes I made in my twenties. Here we go.
There‚Äôs a word for people who think they know everything: Idiot. I meet idiots all the time. And the reason I recognize them is because I used to be one.
Every time you don‚Äôt listen to people smarter than you, when you want to sound smart, or think you know it all ‚Äî you‚Äôre being an idiot. It‚Äôs time to move your ego to the side and understand that life is not about impressing others.
It‚Äôs about fulfillment, collaboration, and the common good. If you want to achieve those things, you need to be humble. But there‚Äôs good news for people who get annoyed by idiots: If they don‚Äôt decide to become humble, life will make them humble at some point.
As a child, you‚Äôre taken care of by others. That may be your parents, siblings, family members, foster parents, or any other person who takes responsibility. Hence, you assume that someone is responsible for you.
But that‚Äôs not true. When you grow up, you are responsible for you. So never look at others when you‚Äôre unhappy ‚Äî it‚Äôs not fair to the people in your life. Instead, accept your unhappiness, and then do something about it.
There‚Äôs a big chance the people in your environment don‚Äôt strive for the same things as you. At some point in my twenties, I was surrounded by people who dropped out of college, were doing drugs, and went out every week.
But it doesn‚Äôt have to be that obvious. Many people live a timid life. People who don‚Äôt want anything from life and who spend their time watching tv.
Don‚Äôt give your time to those people. The cost is high. You might become one of them.
Most of us have this twisted idea about life. ‚ÄúI want her to treat me this and this way.‚Äù Who are you to claim such a thing? And if the other doesn‚Äôt live up to our expectations, we flip out or leave.
That‚Äôs called conditional love. Strive for the opposite. I‚Äôm still learning this. It‚Äôs difficult to let go of your expectations about love. But you have to. Otherwise, you‚Äôll never be happy in your relationship.
When you‚Äôre young, you think you have an endless sea of time. You can do anything you want. And then you blink, and you‚Äôre celebrating your thirtieth birthday.
It‚Äôs a matter of simple math. Just ask yourself these questions:
The answers to these questions will give you clarity about how well you‚Äôre spending your time.
There‚Äôs always someone better looking, cooler, smarter, stronger, or you name it, than you. Always.
So stop thinking you‚Äôre awesome. Compared to what? Because that statement implies you‚Äôre comparing yourself to others. Just be yourself and don‚Äôt compare yourself to others.
Look, when you stop learning and developing yourself; you‚Äôre dead. I‚Äôm not kidding. When I got out of college, I stopped learning. Guess what? I felt stuck after two years.
Push yourself to learn something every day. If you‚Äôre not getting better, you‚Äôre getting worse.
I always ran away from hard things. Improving yourself, working out, saving money, building a business, helping others, investing time in your relationship ‚Äî it‚Äôs all hard when you do it right.
But doing those hard things will have more return on your life, time, energy, and money. When you do something that requires a lot of effort, you feel good about it. When you‚Äôre tired and still go to the gym for a hard work out, you feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that‚Äôs unrivaled.
It‚Äôs the same with your career. If you‚Äôre not doing hard things, don‚Äôt be surprised if you don‚Äôt feel alive.
It‚Äôs a dangerous sign if you can never be alone. I come from a very tightknit family, and I always have had close friends. But I realized that I needed to be alone to grow. So I went on abroad trips by myself.
But that wasn‚Äôt enough. I decided to move to London. When you‚Äôre alone, you have time to know who you are. When you‚Äôre always with others, you‚Äôre just a product of the other people in your life. Sometimes you need to distance yourself from others, it will make you a better person.
Another drink wouldn‚Äôt hurt, right? Sleeping in today is not bad, right? No one cares if I skip my workout today, right? I can easily spend $1500 on a new iPhone, right?
The answer is no, no, no, no, and NO to every other small decision you think has no impact on your life. The truth is that your life is the result of your small decisions.
You are what you do every day. Surprisingly, that‚Äôs actually really good news.
That means you can turn your life around today ‚Äî simply by doing something small that has a good impact on your life.
And what if you keep making mistakes? Who gives a shit!? Just make sure you always learn from it.
There‚Äôs one question at the core of my work: How can we live a useful life that matters? http://dariusforoux.com/

Somehow, we believe that productivity is something that became important after the industrial revolution. We assume that, because we live busy lives, we need to optimize our time ‚Äî especially in the 21st century.
That‚Äôs not true. Productivity has been a topic of discussion ever since ancient eastern and western philosophy started. It‚Äôs a universal theme. I believe it‚Äôs in our nature to make better use of our time.
Because that‚Äôs what productivity means. On a deeper level, we all realize we have limited time. You and I both know that we‚Äôre not getting younger.
Time is ticking. It stops for no one. We need to use it. Etcetera, etcetera ‚Äî we get the idea. And yet, without a clear productivity strategy, we squander our time like we have a limitless supply.
We watch endless hours of mind-numbing TV shows and movies. We spend too much time on social media looking at the lives of people we don‚Äôt give a shit about.
And when our lives and careers do not progress, we complain: ‚ÄúWhy does my life suck and feel empty?‚Äù Because you‚Äôre wasting your damn time!That‚Äôs why!
It‚Äôs time to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to wasting time on useless things that do not bring you anything but short-term pleasure. It‚Äôs time to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to a life of productivity that will bring you a better health, wealth, and more inner satisfaction.
Let‚Äôs start by learning the following 7 productivity lessons from the most well-known philosophers in history. These lessons have helped me a lot, and I hope they will do the same for you.
Who else could give this monumental piece of advice other than Socrates? The founder of Western philosophy realized that it‚Äôs easy to fill your life with meaningless tasks.
But what happens when you do that? The busyness leads to unproductiveness. You end up doing many things in a mediocre way. Instead, focus your time and energy on a few important things.
Don‚Äôt take on more tasks and responsibilities.We often want to get more out of life. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to do more things.
That‚Äôs why the most important productivity lesson is to understand that it‚Äôs not about doing more ‚Äî it‚Äôs about doing the same in less time. We‚Äôll get to HOW you do that later.
Time is a paradoxical concept. Life is long. But our days are short. We can achieve a lot in a lifetime. We can achieve little in a day.
Once you realize that, you won‚Äôt try to do the impossible on an average day. Take it easy. Make small progress every day. Do that by only setting 3‚Äì4 important tasks that will directly contribute to what you want to achieve in life.
If you don‚Äôt have clear goals in your life, it‚Äôs not the end of the world. Aim for universal concepts like self-improvement, joyfulness, and having good relationships. Become the best version of yourself.
But realize that your days are short ‚Äî only set 3‚Äì4 tasks you want to complete.
Set goals. But don‚Äôt stare yourself blind on them. Instead, give your attention to the job itself.
It‚Äôs easy to daydream about all the things we want to do in the future. But that puts us in the wrong state of mind. We risk sacrificing the present for the future. No matter how hard you work today, never see it as a sacrifice.
You will end up resenting yourself. Instead,enjoy your work.Take pride in it. That will not only lead to better results, it will also give you fulfillment.
Elimination is a key strategy for every productive person. You shouldn‚Äôt only eliminate non-essential tasks, but everything that distracts you.
The more you eliminate, the more focus and tranquility you have. Look at yourself as a sculptor. You‚Äôve been given a massive stone. Your task is to eliminate so much until you end up with a perfect piece of art.
Is social media polluting your soul? Eliminate it. Are some people causing you hurt and drama? Eliminate them from your life. Continue eliminating everything else that has a negative impact on your sanity and productivity.
As the famous Roman biographer Plutarchrealized, the ego loves praise, but also blame. In fact, your ego loves any type of attention.
At all times, refuse to please your ego. All you have to do is to be aware that you have an ego. Most people live their lives without ever realizing their ego is hurting their work.
When you excessively blame yourself for things that go wrong, you end up hating yourself ‚Äî and ultimately, everyone else. And when you do the opposite, you end up loving yourself in an unhealthy way. That‚Äôs also called narcissism. A little never hurts.
But when you overdo it, you sacrifice the quality of your work. Hence, don‚Äôt blame or praise yourself. Instead, celebrate the process, not the outcomes.
One unproductive day can destroy your whole momentum. And that can set you back months. Never underestimate how difficult it is to live a productive life.
And realize that most people in your environment will not understand you. ‚ÄúWhat does one more drink hurt?‚Äù Well, A LOT. Even when you‚Äôre resting, do something little that brings you closer to your goals. Read a book, go to the gym, write in your journal.
No matter how small your effort, keep moving and stop for nothing.
Whether we realize it or not, everything we do is part of a system. The first thing you do when you wake up, what you do when you start working, how much you work, where you work, what you eat, whether you work out or not, and so forth.
All your small actions combined, form your system for living. And that leads to the big outcomes in life: More happiness, fulfillment, and better health, wealth ‚Äî it‚Äôs all a result of your system.
So if you don‚Äôt have a productivity system, create one. Like Lao Tzu says, think about the small actions. Like everything in life, small things lead to big things. It‚Äôs up to you to decide WHAT big things you get.
Will you get good or bad outcomes? The latter requires wasting your time, the former requires productive action ‚Äî every day. What will it be?
There‚Äôs one question at the core of my work: How can we live a useful life that matters? http://dariusforoux.com/

Devon Price|171K|11|https://medium.com/@dr_eprice/laziness-does-not-exist-3af27e312d01?source=---------7---------------------|Laziness Does Not Exist ‚Äì Devon Price ‚Äì Medium|"I‚Äôve been a psychology professor since 2012. In the past six years, I‚Äôve witnessed students of all ages procrastinate on papers, skip presentation days, miss assignments, and let due dates fly by. I‚Äôve seen promising prospective grad students fail to get applications in on time; I‚Äôve watched PhD candidates take months or years revising a single dissertation draft; I once had a student who enrolled in the same class of mine two semesters in a row, and never turned in anything either time.
I don‚Äôt think laziness was ever at fault.
Ever.
In fact, I don‚Äôt believe that laziness exists.
...
I‚Äôm a social psychologist, so I‚Äôm interested primarily in the situational and contextual factors that drive human behavior. When you‚Äôre seeking to predict or explain a person‚Äôs actions, looking at the social norms, and the person‚Äôs context, is usually a pretty safe bet. Situational constraints typically predict behavior far better than personality, intelligence, or other individual-level traits.
So when I see a student failing to complete assignments, missing deadlines, or not delivering results in other aspects of their life, I‚Äôm moved to ask: what are the situational factors holding this student back? What needs are currently not being met? And, when it comes to behavioral ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù, I‚Äôm especially moved to ask: what are the barriers to action that I can‚Äôt see?
There are always barriers. Recognizing those barriers‚Äî and viewing them as legitimate ‚Äî is often the first step to breaking ‚Äúlazy‚Äù behavior patterns.
...
It‚Äôs really helpful to respond to a person‚Äôs ineffective behavior with curiosity rather than judgment. I learned this from a friend of mine, the writer and activist Kimberly Longhofer (who publishes under Mik Everett). Kim is passionate about the acceptance and accommodation of disabled people and homeless people. Their writing about both subjects is some of the most illuminating, bias-busting work I‚Äôve ever encountered. Part of that is because Kim is brilliant, but it‚Äôs also because at various points in their life, Kim has been both disabled and homeless.
Kim is the person who taught me that judging a homeless person for wanting to buy alcohol or cigarettes is utter folly. When you‚Äôre homeless, the nights are cold, the world is unfriendly, and everything is painfully uncomfortable. Whether you‚Äôre sleeping under a bridge, in a tent, or at a shelter, it‚Äôs hard to rest easy. You are likely to have injuries or chronic conditions that bother you persistently, and little access to medical care to deal with it. You probably don‚Äôt have much healthy food.
In that chronically uncomfortable, over-stimulating context, needing a drink or some cigarettes makes fucking sense. As Kim explained to me, if you‚Äôre laying out in the freezing cold, drinking some alcohol may be the only way to warm up and get to sleep. If you‚Äôre under-nourished, a few smokes may be the only thing that kills the hunger pangs. And if you‚Äôre dealing with all this while also fighting an addiction, then yes, sometimes you just need to score whatever will make the withdrawal symptoms go away, so you can survive.
Few people who haven‚Äôt been homeless think this way. They want to moralize the decisions of poor people, perhaps to comfort themselves about the injustices of the world. For many, it‚Äôs easier to think homeless people are, in part, responsible for their suffering than it is to acknowledge the situational factors.
And when you don‚Äôt fully understand a person‚Äôs context ‚Äî what it feels like to be them every day, all the small annoyances and major traumas that define their life ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to impose abstract, rigid expectations on a person‚Äôs behavior. All homeless people should put down the bottle and get to work. Never mind that most of them have mental health symptoms and physical ailments, and are fighting constantly to be recognized as human. Never mind that they are unable to get a good night‚Äôs rest or a nourishing meal for weeks or months on end. Never mind that even in my comfortable, easy life, I can‚Äôt go a few days without craving a drink or making an irresponsible purchase. They have to do better.
But they‚Äôre already doing the best they can. I‚Äôve known homeless people who worked full-time jobs, and who devoted themselves to the care of other people in their communities. A lot of homeless people have to navigate bureaucracies constantly, interfacing with social workers, case workers, police officers, shelter staff, Medicaid staff, and a slew of charities both well-meaning and condescending. It‚Äôs a lot of fucking work to be homeless. And when a homeless or poor person runs out of steam and makes a ‚Äúbad decision‚Äù, there‚Äôs a damn good reason for it.
If a person‚Äôs behavior doesn‚Äôt make sense to you, it is because you are missing a part of their context. It‚Äôs that simple. I‚Äôm so grateful to Kim and their writing for making me aware of this fact. No psychology class, at any level, taught me that. But now that it is a lens that I have, I find myself applying it to all kinds of behaviors that are mistaken for signs of moral failure ‚Äî and I‚Äôve yet to find one that can‚Äôt be explained and empathized with.
...
Let‚Äôs look at a sign of academic ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù that I believe is anything but: procrastination.
People love to blame procrastinators for their behavior. Putting off work sure looks lazy, to an untrained eye. Even the people who are actively doing the procrastinating can mistake their behavior for laziness. You‚Äôre supposed to be doing something, and you‚Äôre not doing it ‚Äî that‚Äôs a moral failure right? That means you‚Äôre weak-willed, unmotivated, and lazy, doesn‚Äôt it?
For decades, psychological research has been able to explain procrastination as a functioning problem, not a consequence of laziness. When a person fails to begin a project that they care about, it‚Äôs typically due to either a) anxiety about their attempts not being ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù or b) confusion about what the first steps of the task are. Not laziness. In fact, procrastination is more likely when the task is meaningful and the individual cares about doing it well.
When you‚Äôre paralyzed with fear of failure, or you don‚Äôt even know how to begin a massive, complicated undertaking, it‚Äôs damn hard to get shit done. It has nothing to do with desire, motivation, or moral upstandingness. Procastinators can will themselves to work for hours; they can sit in front of a blank word document, doing nothing else, and torture themselves; they can pile on the guilt again and again ‚Äî none of it makes initiating the task any easier. In fact, their desire to get the damn thing done may worsen their stress and make starting the task harder.
The solution, instead, is to look for what is holding the procrastinator back. If anxiety is the major barrier, the procrastinator actually needs to walk away from the computer/book/word document and engage in a relaxing activity. Being branded ‚Äúlazy‚Äù by other people is likely to lead to the exact opposite behavior.
Often, though, the barrier is that procrastinators have executive functioning challenges ‚Äî they struggle to divide a large responsibility into a series of discrete, specific, and ordered tasks. Here‚Äôs an example of executive functioning in action: I completed my dissertation (from proposal to data collection to final defense) in a little over a year. I was able to write my dissertation pretty easily and quickly because I knew that I had to a) compile research on the topic, b) outline the paper, c) schedule regular writing periods, and d) chip away at the paper, section by section, day by day, according to a schedule I had pre-determined.
Nobody had to teach me to slice up tasks like that. And nobody had to force me to adhere to my schedule. Accomplishing tasks like this is consistent with how my analytical, hyper-focused, Autistic little brain works. Most people don‚Äôt have that ease. They need an external structure to keep them writing ‚Äî regular writing group meetings with friends, for example ‚Äî and deadlines set by someone else. When faced with a major, massive project, most people want advice for how to divide it into smaller tasks, and a timeline for completion. In order to track progress, most people require organizational tools, such as a to-do list, calendar, datebook, or syllabus.
Needing or benefiting from such things doesn‚Äôt make a person lazy. It just means they have needs. The more we embrace that, the more we can help people thrive.
...
I had a student who was skipping class. Sometimes I‚Äôd see her lingering near the building, right before class was about to start, looking tired. Class would start, and she wouldn‚Äôt show up. When she was present in class, she was a bit withdrawn; she sat in the back of the room, eyes down, energy low. She contributed during small group work, but never talked during larger class discussions.
A lot of my colleagues would look at this student and think she was lazy, disorganized, or apathetic. I know this because I‚Äôve heard how they talk about under-performing students. There‚Äôs often rage and resentment in their words and tone ‚Äî why won‚Äôt this student take my class seriously? Why won‚Äôt they make me feel important, interesting, smart?
But my class had a unit on mental health stigma. It‚Äôs a passion of mine, because I‚Äôm a neuroatypical psychologist. I know how unfair my field is to people like me. The class & I talked about the unfair judgments people levy against those with mental illness; how depression is interpreted as laziness, how mood swings are framed as manipulative, how people with ‚Äúsevere‚Äù mental illnesses are assumed incompetent or dangerous.
The quiet, occasionally-class-skipping student watched this discussion with keen interest. After class, as people filtered out of the room, she hung back and asked to talk to me. And then she disclosed that she had a mental illness and was actively working to treat it. She was busy with therapy and switching medications, and all the side effects that entails. Sometimes, she was not able to leave the house or sit still in a classroom for hours. She didn‚Äôt dare tell her other professors that this was why she was missing classes and late, sometimes, on assignments; they‚Äôd think she was using her illness as an excuse. But she trusted me to understand.
And I did. And I was so, so angry that this student was made to feel responsible for her symptoms. She was balancing a full course load, a part-time job, and ongoing, serious mental health treatment. And she was capable of intuiting her needs and communicating them with others. She was a fucking badass, not a lazy fuck. I told her so.
She took many more classes with me after that, and I saw her slowly come out of her shell. By her Junior and Senior years, she was an active, frank contributor to class ‚Äî she even decided to talk openly with her peers about her mental illness. During class discussions, she challenged me and asked excellent, probing questions. She shared tons of media and current-events examples of psychological phenomena with us. When she was having a bad day, she told me, and I let her miss class. Other professors ‚Äî including ones in the psychology department ‚Äî remained judgmental towards her, but in an environment where her barriers were recognized and legitimized, she thrived.
...
Over the years, at that same school, I encountered countless other students who were under-estimated because the barriers in their lives were not seen as legitimate. There was the young man with OCD who always came to class late, because his compulsions sometimes left him stuck in place for a few moments. There was the survivor of an abusive relationship, who was processing her trauma in therapy appointments right before my class each week. There was the young woman who had been assaulted by a peer ‚Äî and who had to continue attending classes with that peer, while the school was investigating the case.
These students all came to me willingly, and shared what was bothering them. Because I discussed mental illness, trauma, and stigma in my class, they knew I would be understanding. And with some accommodations, they blossomed academically. They gained confidence, made attempts at assignments that intimidated them, raised their grades, started considering graduate school and internships. I always found myself admiring them. When I was a college student, I was nowhere near as self-aware. I hadn‚Äôt even begun my lifelong project of learning to ask for help.
...
Students with barriers were not always treated with such kindness by my fellow psychology professors. One colleague, in particular, was infamous for providing no make-up exams and allowing no late arrivals. No matter a student‚Äôs situation, she was unflinchingly rigid in her requirements. No barrier was insurmountable, in her mind; no limitation was acceptable. People floundered in her class. They felt shame about their sexual assault histories, their anxiety symptoms, their depressive episodes. When a student who did poorly in her classes performed well in mine, she was suspicious.
It‚Äôs morally repugnant to me that any educator would be so hostile to the people they are supposed to serve. It‚Äôs especially infuriating, that the person enacting this terror was a psychologist. The injustice and ignorance of it leaves me teary every time I discuss it. It‚Äôs a common attitude in many educational circles, but no student deserves to encounter it.
...
I know, of course, that educators are not taught to reflect on what their students‚Äô unseen barriers are. Some universities pride themselves on refusing to accommodate disabled or mentally ill students ‚Äî they mistake cruelty for intellectual rigor. And, since most professors are people who succeeded academically with ease, they have trouble taking the perspective of someone with executive functioning struggles, sensory overloads, depression, self-harm histories, addictions, or eating disorders. I can see the external factors that lead to these problems. Just as I know that ‚Äúlazy‚Äù behavior is not an active choice, I know that judgmental, elitist attitudes are typically borne out of situational ignorance.
And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this piece. I‚Äôm hoping to awaken my fellow educators ‚Äî of all levels ‚Äî to the fact that if a student is struggling, they probably aren‚Äôt choosing to. They probably want to do well. They probably are trying. More broadly, I want all people to take a curious and empathic approach to individuals whom they initially want to judge as ‚Äúlazy‚Äù or irresponsible.
If a person can‚Äôt get out of bed, something is making them exhausted. If a student isn‚Äôt writing papers, there‚Äôs some aspect of the assignment that they can‚Äôt do without help. If an employee misses deadlines constantly, something is making organization and deadline-meeting difficult. Even if a person is actively choosing to self-sabotage, there‚Äôs a reason for it ‚Äî some fear they‚Äôre working through, some need not being met, a lack of self-esteem being expressed.
People do not choose to fail or disappoint. No one wants to feel incapable, apathetic, or ineffective. If you look at a person‚Äôs action (or inaction) and see only laziness, you are missing key details. There is always an explanation. There are always barriers. Just because you can‚Äôt see them, or don‚Äôt view them as legitimate, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not there. Look harder.
Maybe you weren‚Äôt always able to look at human behavior this way. That‚Äôs okay. Now you are. Give it a try.

2018 is turning 2019. You are feeling hopeful and motivated to bring positive change to your life.
A new year brings a new beginning, right?
Armed with these 17 actionable steps you'll be able to radically improve your life. Let's get to it?
How often have you set New Year resolutions just to fall shortly after 1‚Äì2 months?
New month resolutions, 90 day years, or daily themes help you get over analysis paralysis of making big life decisions.
‚ÄúI like pushing myself to the limit and pushing the envelope, and in my mind, that is not really compatible with a reliable long-term plan,‚Äù says Tim Ferriss. ‚ÄúI generally treat my life as six-month projects and two-week experiments of various types. Then I take the most attractive door that pops up, and rinse and repeat.‚Äù
Todd Herman recommends picking a 90 Day theme.
You can also commit to monthly challenges like 1) no movies, 2) daily meditation, 3) quit social media, 4) read daily for 30 mins.
Action steps:
You have a lot less time than you think, and you‚Äôre not spending it the way you think you are.
Create an hour-by-hour log to see where your time is spent over a week and you'll be shocked with results.
When Drew Houston (founder of Dropbox) did this exercise he was stunned to discover that 1) his jar was mostly filled with sand and 2) really important rocks were falling on the ground.
When you view your life as a laboratory and start to consistently track and review your activities, you will naturally optimize how you do things.
What gets measured, gets improved.
Action steps:
It's OK to have a bad day, it's not OK to have a bad week.
Figure out what makes you unique.
By learning how your machine works you can gain a tremendous edge.
When you focus on your weaknesses, everything seems like hard work. When you follow your natural strengths, work becomes a challenging play.
Take time to discover your innate abilities, blind spots, and personality traits. If you've never done it before, it will be a transforming experience (it was for me).
Action steps:
Whether you own a business or not, you're a marketer. If you want to get others to say YES to you, you must understand what makes people tick.
Brendon Burchard recommends all his clients, even his Olympic athletes, to take at least two sales courses each year and two social psychology courses.
Russell Brunson said all his millionaire mastermind members are OBSESSED with marketing. There is a reason why many successful business owners recommend Cialdini's book ‚ÄúInfluence‚Äù (and not some business book).
So get obsessed about understanding fundamental human nature, psychology, and persuasion. It will change your life.
Action steps:
Successful people are cautious about their relationship with technology.
Technology allows us to do amazing things, but we have become addicted to it.
Yuval Noah Harari says, ‚ÄúIf you are not careful, technology will start dictating your aims and enslaving you to it‚Äôs agenda [...]
We are not living in the era of hacking computers ‚Äî we are living in the era of hacking humans. Once the corporations and governments know you better than you know yourself, they could control and manipulate you and you won‚Äôt even realize it.‚Äù
Neil Strauss, for example, blocks his computer from Internet access for 22h a day (with app Freedom) and has a timed safe, where he can drop his phone into.
It‚Äôs time for you to take back control.
Action steps:
When people hear the word ‚Äúconstraint‚Äù they think of it as a negative. But in truth, it's a powerful force for good.
A constraint is where you extremely limit yourself in one field so you can be extremely creative in another.
Few examples:
Why? Because successful people know that mental energy is in limited quantity.
You can also create constraints in your work. For example, if you're a writer you could commit to only writing and mastering 3,000-word list post.
Action steps:
Few ideas: Create a weekly meal plan. Create themes for days of the week. Read this for more ideas.
Successful people spend a lot of time thinking about problems before jumping to fix them. They figure out the lead domino that would kick off all the others in one fell swoop.
Dwight D. Eisenhower has been credited as the most productive and effective president the US ever had. Using Eisenhower Matrix you can shift from being busy to becoming effective.
The core idea is that you should spend as much time as possible doing Important / Non-Urgent things, instead of putting off fires (Urgent / Important).
Action steps:
The idea of deliberate practice is often confused with just working hard.
Musicians and athletes know this naturally. They separate playing from practicing. For some reason, knowledge workers forget this. But growth doesn't just magically happen.
Michael Simmons talks about 5-hour rule. You need to learn 5 hours a week just to stay relevant.
But proactive training regimen must be developed if you want to get ahead.
Cal Newport has said, ‚ÄúDoing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that‚Äôs exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands....‚Äù
Action steps:
‚ÄúWhat am I going to do with my life?‚Äù
Don't you get anxious just thinking about that question?
Successful people are incredibly patient in long-term, but they don't waste their days worrying about years.
While you are busy asking yourself existential questions and then procrastinate watching Netflix, successful people are in the trenches figuring things out as they go.
‚ÄúThey say:‚ÄùThink Big! Have a compelling vision!‚Äù I say: Think Small. Do something super cool by the end of the day. Excellence is the next five minutes or nothing at all. It‚Äôs the quality of your next five-minute conversation. It‚Äôs the quality of, yes, your next email.‚Äú ‚Äî Tom Peters
You don't have to figure everything out now. Just be clear about what you would like to happen today and give it your best.
Action step
Don't overthink. Just pick something where you love the process, has good income potential and go do that.
But what if it's the wrong direction? ‚Äî you may ask.
You'll find out sooner. üòä
The most valuable career skill is public speaking, some would argue.
But what‚Äôs public speaking? It‚Äôs just words that impact people.
‚ÄúMore and more communication is written today,‚Äù said Jason Fried.‚ÄúGet great at presenting yourself with words, and words alone, and you‚Äôll be far ahead of most.‚Äú
After you've studied marketing from #4, with copywriting you learn how to put that knowledge in words.
Action steps:
Have you noticed?
The more time you have to complete a task, the more time it takes to do it.
You can move faster than you think. You can train yourself to shorten the time it takes to complete tasks.
Said historian Will Durant, ‚ÄúI think the ability of the average man could be doubled if it were demanded, if the situation demanded.‚Äù
You'll be blown away how fast you can move if you just make the decision to move fast.
Action steps:
Inner critic exists in all of us.
What about successful people? They have it too. The only difference is that they have learned how to manage it.
How?
The negative self-talk actually is a form of self-absorption. What is that voice in your head saying when the critic comes out? ‚Äî ‚ÄúYou don't have what it takes. Last time you just got lucky. You'll fail.‚Äù
Notice anything? Yup ‚Äî it's all about you!
When you realize this, the solution becomes simple ‚Äî shift your perspective from yourself to how your work will help other people.
Action steps:
Successful people are growth friends to others.
They know that other people‚Äôs success doesn‚Äôt diminish their own.
While insecure people constantly doubt themselves and criticize others in order to prove their self-worth, successful people compliment and help others.
Ironically, they feel better themselves as a result.
Negativity is a choice. What choice are you making?
Action steps:
When you‚Äôre too comfortable you drown in boredom and depression as Yerkes-Dodson law illustrates:
The solution? Get used to stretching yourself. Peak performance and discomfort go hand in hand.
Success can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have and uncomfortable actions you are willing to make.
Action steps:
Successful people don't fight their human nature, they learn how to manage it.
‚ÄúI think we all have two main characters in our heads: a rational decision-maker (the adult in your head) and instant gratification monkey (the child in your head who doesn't care about consequences and just wants to maximize the ease and pleasure of the present moment).
For me, these two are in a constant battle, and the monkey usually wins. But I've found that if I turn life into a yin-yang situation ‚Äî e.g. ‚Äúwork till 6 today, then no work till tomorrow‚Äù ‚Äî it's much easier to control the monkey in the work period.‚Äù ‚Äî said Tim Urban (from WaitButWhy) on his incredible TED Talk.
By acknowledging that gratification monkey exists, you can come up with solutions. The first step toward change is awareness.
Action steps:
Nowadays people are obsessed with failure.
But the truth is you don't learn the most from failures.
This idea may make you feel better, but whenever you want to do something well, you do it by studying people who are really good and have achieved results you desire.
For example, you don't study all the failed writers to learn how to become a great storyteller; you study the world's best storytellers.
Yes, if you want to become the top 1% you will fail a lot, but don't distort your thinking that you should take all your lessons from failure.
Model what works instead.
This is how Tony Robbins does it:
The quality of your life depends on questions you ask yourself.
Ask lousy questions, get lousy answers.
You can ask, ‚ÄúWhat makes me happy?‚Äù ‚Äî You‚Äôll get a good answer.
What if you ask, ‚ÄúWhat gives me bliss?‚Äù ‚Äî You‚Äôll get a great answer.
Tim Ferris has said, ‚ÄúIn my experience, going from 1x to 10x, from 10x to 100x, and from 100x to (when Lady Luck really smiles) 1000x returns in various areas has been a product of better questions. John Dewey‚Äôs dictum that ‚Äúa problem well put is half-solved‚Äù applies.‚Äù
Growth is stimulated by asking ‚Äî Why?
Here are some great questions to ask yourself:
I urge you to kick off 2019 with a bang or even better ‚Äî set a new month resolution today!
Remember people who succeed are no smarter than you, they are just people who have acquired skills and habits through patient consistency.
So start little.
You've got this!

How we respond to Facebook today will inform the startups of tomorrow

I deleted my Facebook a few weeks ago, but it started scaring me last March.
A friend and I ran into one of his investors in a cafeÃÅ in San Francisco, and the investor asked if we‚Äôd heard of a Soylent competitor, Ample. He was curious what we thought of it, and of meal replacement companies in general.
I hadn‚Äôt heard of Ample, but I shared my concerns with Soylent, and why I personally would never put my money into one of those companies. My friend, for the most part, agreed.
The conversation ended and we left. I didn‚Äôt think about Ample again, look it up, or talk about it online with anyone. But less than 24 hours later, there were ads for it in my Instagram feed.
It was spooky, to say the least. I was used to getting ads for products whose sites I‚Äôd visited, and for products I‚Äôd mentioned on Facebook, but products that I‚Äôd only talked about? That was weird.
After a bit of digging, I discovered I wasn‚Äôt alone. There were dozens of stories online about people getting freaked out by ads that seem like they only could have come from Facebook eavesdropping on their conversations.
Now to be clear, this probably isn‚Äôt happening. It would be a massive amount of work and data processing for marginally better ad targeting. Like the Wired article says, Facebook doesn‚Äôt need to listen to your conversations.
They can target you well enough without it.
That‚Äôs meant to be reassuring: they‚Äôre not listening to you because they don‚Äôt have to. But if anything, that should be even scarier. Facebook knows so much about you they can make you believe they‚Äôre listening to your personal conversations. They have so much data about you they can send you ads that have an uncanny relevance to what is going on in the real world.
Imagine, for a moment, that you had a friend with this level of knowledge about you. Someone who knows everywhere you go, what you like, what you fear, what you want, who you hang out with, how happy you are at any given moment.
They could be an amazing boon to your life. Or they could be a nightmare. It all depends on what they do with the information, and how well you can trust them with it.
Now imagine the friend can use their information about you to make money, say by manipulating your decisions to benefit them. And imagine they‚Äôre the kind of morally bankrupt person who would take advantage of their friend this way.
What would their incentives look like?
Since they can make money by manipulating your decisions, they‚Äôll try to manipulate your decisions. And since they can better manipulate your decisions by learning more about you, the more they‚Äôll want to learn. If they want the greatest success for themselves, they will necessarily have to manipulate you as much as possible and collect as much data on you as possible.
This seems to be the situation Facebook has gotten itself into:
Facebook‚Äôs product is not the platform, it‚Äôs us. If the product is what a business sells to make money, then Facebook‚Äôs product is our attention and data. We are the product. And Facebook‚Äôs customers are the companies buying ads based on that attention and data.
If our time and our attention are Facebook‚Äôs true product, then their long-term goal becomes clear: to influence (and tax) how we communicate in the 21st century. Every product they‚Äôve launched and company they‚Äôve acquired is related to this goal in some way:
Facebook wants to own how we communicate because it means more data and more attention, which means more ads revenue. Simple enough.
But that idea should be a little frightening: a company wants to control how you interact with other humans so that they can make money off of you. This isn‚Äôt some secret, evil motivation driving the company behind closed doors. It‚Äôs a necessary consequence of the incentives that shape it.
Compare this model to Netflix. You pay Netflix a flat monthly fee, and in return, you get unlimited streaming movies and TV shows from their platform. Netflix doesn‚Äôt make more money the more time you spend on it (they make less, actually), so they have no incentive to addict you to the platform (beyond keeping you from switching to a competitor). With Netflix, we‚Äôre the customers.
This isn‚Äôt to say that all free, ad-financed apps are bad and all pay-to-play apps are good. I‚Äôve used Foursquare and Swarm consistently for 7+ years. These are apps where I volunteer my location, travel, eating, and shopping habits, and I‚Äôve never had the slightest sense that Foursquare was using this data in a way that made my life worse.
The ads in Foursquare tend to be useful. Their goal for the product is to be the place consumers go to find the next restaurant or cafeÃÅ to try. They don‚Äôt need you to spend tons of time in the app, and they don‚Äôt need you to buy products from vendors unrelated to your in-app goals. They just want you to stay in the habit of checking in places and finding places through them, so they serve you ads related to the kinds of foods and stores you tend to like.
If Foursquare started using that data in a way that made me uncomfortable, I‚Äôd stop using it. If every time I checked into a restaurant I started getting emails from them afterwards, I‚Äôd know Foursquare was selling my email address to places I checked in and I wouldn‚Äôt be cool with that. I‚Äôd delete it, and switch to an app I had more trust in.
The problem with Facebook is that its managed to gain such a monopoly on our digital presence that we worry about quitting it. Switching from Foursquare to Yelp doesn‚Äôt give anyone anxiety, but deleting Facebook does.
How did Facebook get so ingrained in our lives that people who lived without it for thirty years are suddenly concerned about losing it?
Partially for the same reason people joined in the first place: information. We want to know what‚Äôs going on in the lives of our friends and acquaintances, and Facebook has become the go-to source for doing that.
But in the process, Facebook has changed friendship from an active to a passive process. You can sit back and wait for some update to appear from a friend or acquaintance and then respond to it. You don‚Äôt have to put in any effort to reach out and ask what‚Äôs going on, you get it fed to your by the magical friend algorithms.
How often do you reach out to your friends to ask them how it‚Äôs going? Or to see if there are any big updates in their lives? There‚Äôs hardly any need anymore, since Facebook has automated the process. We don‚Äôt have to put in the work, the information comes to us, and so we‚Äôve lost the muscles we used to use for staying updated on our social circle.
It‚Äôs similar to the problem I outlined in my article on the switch from search to social. As we moved away from actively looking for things on the Internet, having them fed to us instead, we became more passive informational consumers. And as we move more towards passive Facebook-style friendships, we lose our old abilities to stay in touch with people.
This would be fine if Facebook relationships were as meaningful as in-person ones, but they aren‚Äôt. Conversations through chat apps and getting up to date on your friends through the newsfeed is the relationship equivalent of Soylent. A technological pseudo-improvement over an ancient human process, and one that falls dramatically short of the value it‚Äôs trying to recreate.
And since we‚Äôve been sipping the Facebook friend juice for so long, it‚Äôs legitimately scary to quit. How will you know what events are going on? How will you know if something big happens in your friend‚Äôs life? How will you stay in touch with people?
The simple answer is... all the ways we did for the last 100,000 years. Talking to people. Being an active consumer of information and knowledge about your friends‚Äô lives instead of letting it passively wash over you.
But it would still be fair to ask: why bother. Yes, quitting Facebook does make it more likely that you‚Äôll miss events, updates, and messages, since other people are on it. And yes, it can be a little inconvenient to not have it at times, depending on your friend group.
So why is it worth it to delete the social network instead of begrudgingly continuing to use it?
Someone observing the digital landscape a couple years from now could see Facebook continuing its dominance and deduce that it‚Äôs fine to play fast and loose with customer data in the name of growth, to optimize your product around addictiveness, and to sell information on your users.
Or, in a couple years, they could see the massive consequences Facebook faced for behaving that way. They could see people chose to give their attention to products they trust, and left Facebook in droves.
Which is why quitting Facebook matters: it sends the message that companies can‚Äôt, and shouldn‚Äôt, try to have that much power over our lives. That if other companies try in the future, they‚Äôll get punished for it.
If someone in our social circle deceives us or lies to us, we tell our friends. We use gossip to spread information about who is and isn‚Äôt trustworthy, partially so there are consequences for not being trustworthy. If businesses aren‚Äôt subject to the same consequences for not being trustworthy, they‚Äôll have no motivation to think before they do something that could break their users‚Äô trust.
If Facebook thinks they can keep focusing on addiction, ad revenue, and data collection with no consequences, they‚Äôll keep doing it.
Reflecting on how Facebook has become such a dominant force in our lives the last five to ten years, and the consequences of that dominance, I think there are a few key lessons from it that we can apply to other technologies:
Facebook can‚Äôt replace socialization and face-to-face communication. Soylent can‚Äôt replace food. Porn can‚Äôt replace sex. Tinder can‚Äôt replace dating. It‚Äôs tempting to try to technologize everything in our lives, but it won‚Äôt work for these more old-school processes, and we should stop believing that four guys in their Harvard dorm room can really make a better social network than the one we have IRL.
Opt for services you pay for instead of services that sell your information. Pay to remove ads whenever possible. When you‚Äôre using a product for free, you‚Äôre still paying for it in some way, typically through the data and attention you‚Äôre giving it. Watch out for the incentives of companies and products you use, and don‚Äôt expect that they‚Äôll all be benevolent masters of your information.
If a company can‚Äôt be trusted, ditch them, and let them feel the consequences. If a product can get away with mistreating its users to make money, it will keep doing it until they feel the consequences.
Facebook has become the abusive partner in many people‚Äôs lives. They‚Äôve carved out such a seemingly important role in your life that even though you want to leave, you‚Äôre scared of the consequences.
But I can‚Äôt stress enough how little impact quitting has on your life. I was almost entirely off it for a year before deleting it, and in that time I‚Äôve never missed it. Have I missed an event or two? Probably, but that‚Äôs a small price to pay.
And as for staying up to date on my friends lives... well I just do it the old fashioned way. Talking to them. Which is wonderful since we actually have something to talk about when we meet in person, instead of sitting on our phones looking at Facebook to get up to date on all our other friends‚Äô lives.
Imagine going back 10 years and being told that if you signed up for Facebook, they were going to collect a disturbing amount of information on you, manipulate your emotions, store your conversations, and try to control how you communicate with people online. Would you sign up? Would you let your kid sign up?
I wouldn‚Äôt, and I don‚Äôt think you would either.
Here‚Äôs how to quit when you‚Äôre ready.

Aphinya Dechalert|4|4|https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/6-reasons-why-im-considering-saying-goodbye-to-facebook-30e6600c345a?source=---------1---------------------|6 Reasons Why I‚Äôm Considering Saying Goodbye to Facebook|"Yesterday I considered deleting Facebook from my phone. The thought made me pause for a moment and evaluate the reasons behind why I wanted to do so.
Here are 6 reasons why.
I‚Äôm sure I liked a variety of stuff on Facebook but unless there is cash pumped into the system, I don‚Äôt get to see them anymore.
Gone are the days were I see programming memes. Instead, there is a entire wall of news articles simply because I started to comment on some of them here and there. Now all its showing me is just that ‚Äî more of the same in hopes to replicate the interaction again.
There is no novelty.
Just more of the same and if you interact with it enough, that‚Äôs all you‚Äôll ever get ‚Äî nothing more, nothing less.
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just not me that feels this way but everyone seems to be a keyboard warrior nowadays. If they‚Äôre not offended by lost in digital space joke, then it‚Äôs a sudden decline into personal attacks.
There is no discussion. There is no intelligence. Only a bunch of people thinking that they‚Äôre better, smarter and louder than you. They must be heard and agreed with ‚Äî even if you make a valid comment. Asking them to clarify is like asking them to crucify you with a torrent of words beginning with c and f.
Nothing feels real anymore. Likes, hearts, laughs and amazed faces feels like a passing acknowledgement of your existence.
The more pictures you post, the more competitive you get with yourself and others to post more for likes and hearts. Some people may enjoy the thrill of being acknowledge for the experience but I find the entire exercise futile ‚Äî especially when you‚Äôre doing it for external rather than internal reasons.
This is probably linked to point number 1.
If you‚Äôve ever made the mistake of clicking on an advert ‚Äî even if its by accident or out of genuine interest, you‚Äôll never see the end of it.
I did that the other day and now I only see two things on my feed: adverts for bookkeeping and the national newspaper feed.
There is always someone having it rough, or breaking up, or not sure how to deal with money issues, or getting offended for their weight, height, skin color, hair style choices and sexual orientation. If it‚Äôs not politics, it‚Äôs someone getting angry at the world.
I go on Facebook to relax but instead I end up feeling more stressed out by the fake news and internet arguments.
I once tried to game the algorithm by only liking and commenting in a gardening group. Yet somehow angry vegans posting overtly biased managed to take over my news feed. There‚Äôs no escape.
Everyone is sad and angry on Facebook it seems ‚Äî even if I don‚Äôt know or connected to them in any way.
Lets admit it ‚Äî Facebook sucks more time out of your day than anything. The idle addiction is real.
An hour on the train or bus, another hour in front of the TV, maybe during dinner and perhaps a little bit more before bed ‚Äî you‚Äôre always glued to your phone and if its not Facebook, then its Snapchat, Instagram or some other social media app.
It‚Äôs one big time sink.
Time just disappears at the snap of your fingers. It feels very important at the time but internally, deep down, you know that its not contributing much to anything in particular except for perhaps taking time away from the things that you‚Äôve always wanted to do, the places where you‚Äôve always wanted to go, the time you‚Äôre always complaining about not having enough.
Probably.
I‚Äôm getting rather close to it since it doesn‚Äôt add value to my existence.
However, there are a few groups that I go into (such as the gardening groups) to decompress.
I don‚Äôt know what it is but Facebook only wants to show me the sad and angry kind of things. I have to physically and mindfully search for the things I want to see in order to see it.
Perhaps I‚Äôm part of some algorithm human experiment. It‚Äôs known to be done in the past.
Perhaps I‚Äôm not.
Who knows anymore.
All I know is that it‚Äôs not making me happy and only sapping away whatever time that‚Äôs left of my youth and what little time I have left after a day spent taking care of the toddler.
There are dreams I want to make realities. There are places I want to go. There are experiences I want to have.
And being on Facebook will certainly not get me there.
I am in pursuit of balance ‚Äî physically, emotionally and financially. This is my Personal Legend. Thank you for reading.‚ù§

It‚Äôs a classic movie from the 1990‚Äôs. In it, Bill Murray plays a weatherman. He goes to the small town of Punxsutawney in February. To report if the groundhog will predict 6 more weeks of winter. (A strange tradition here in the US, if you think about it.)
He wakes up the next morning. nd finds that he is destined to experience the exact same day over and over and over again. The same song on the morning radio (I Got You, Babe). The same run-in with an overzealous insurance salesman.
At first he is confused, then angry and frustrated. He tries everything to change the circumstances around him. And he can‚Äôt. Then he becomes resigned. Over and over he repeats that same day.
It is only when he realizes that he can‚Äôt change the day. He can only change himself. Then he evolves into a different person. People respond to him in a different way. So he can finally live a different day.
Do you ever feel like your life is the movie Groundhog Day? We can all identify with that movie. Because we‚Äôve all been in a phase of our lives where we feel like we are fated to repeat the same day over and over. Get up, go to work, eat dinner, go to bed. We want more, different, better. But we don‚Äôt know how.
We can‚Äôt always change the circumstances of our life. But we can change our approach to it. And the choices we make.
Here are a few steps that can help get you out of that same day.
Many of us feel trapped in our day because of our sense that we don‚Äôt have enough time. We want more time to focus on our health, or work on a passion project. But we have to spend a certain number of hours per day at our job. We have a commute. We have family commitments. People need things from us and we have to provide them.
But is that true? Keep track of everything you do in a day. Write it down for a few days, either on a piece of paper or in your phone. Will you find that you are you spending 2 hours a day looking at Instagram? Are you doing tasks at work that are someone else‚Äôs job? Tasks you took on because it was just easier, or because you didn‚Äôt want to say no?
Keeping track of your day can be a first step toward understanding what goes in to that daily grind. To figuring out what are the essential tasks. And finding opportunities for change.
Once you track your day, you might see some things that surprise you. Or don‚Äôt align with the priorities of your life. Let‚Äôs say you spent 2 hours at a parent association meeting for your kids‚Äô school last week. You did it because you want to stay involved in your kids‚Äô lives. (And because someone asked you to come and you didn‚Äôt want to say no.). But when you think about it, you had to get a babysitter to watch your kids during those two hours. Or leave work during that time. You didn‚Äôt actually learn anything about your kids. You weren‚Äôt even with them.
So when you stand back and assess your actions, you can see that they didn‚Äôt have the intended result. And you realize that going to that monthly parent association meeting doesn‚Äôt make sense.
As Greg McKeown wrote in Essentialism,
It took a long time for you to get into that daily routine. It is a habit that you created over the course of many months or even years. Get your coffee from the same place, drive the same way to work. Eat a candy bar from the vending machine at 3pm on the dot.
Trying to overhaul the entire day at once is unlikely to stick long term. Unless you decide to up and move to Nepal. But if you plan to keep your same job and same family and live in the same town. You need to start small.
Pick one thing that you‚Äôd like to change. It could be removing that parent association meeting from your calendar. It could be that 3pm candy bar. Pick one thing that is not serving you. That does not align with your priorities and values. And change it. Make sure the change sticks. And then try something else.
As James Clear points out in his book Atomic Habits, a 1% improvement over yesterday might not seem like much day to day. But over the course of a year it can be life changing.
Sometimes we are trapped in our daily grind because we are too afraid of what will happen if we make a change. Here are some thoughts that might come up:
Change is scary. Even if we want something different and better, our own brains can hold us back. It can tell us to run away. Even a small life change can feel the same as being chased by a tiger.
But the reality is, you know you are not living your most fulfilling life right now. A change could go wrong. But what is the worst that could happen? You will feel exactly the same as you do now. There is always another opportunity to change.
It may feel silly to pat yourself on the back for something small. To celebrate when you‚Äôve swapped out that candy bar for a walk around the block. But the reward is what will help that change stick. Its what will help drive you forward. And get you out of that rut.
From Charles Duhigg‚Äôs book The Power of Habit:
We all have more power than we realize. We aren‚Äôt always able to change the circumstances around us. But we can change what we choose, and what we think about ourselves. And we can focus on the things things align with our own priorities. No matter what anyone else thinks.

In the past six years, I‚Äôve witnessed students of all ages procrastinate on papers, skip presentation days, miss assignments, and let due dates fly by. I‚Äôve seen promising prospective grad students fail to get applications in on time; I‚Äôve watched PhD candidates take months or years revising a single dissertation draft; I once had a student who enrolled in the same class of mine two semesters in a row, and never turned in anything either time.
I don‚Äôt think laziness was ever at fault.
Ever.
In fact, I don‚Äôt believe that laziness exists.
...
I‚Äôm a social psychologist, so I‚Äôm interested primarily in the situational and contextual factors that drive human behavior. When you‚Äôre seeking to predict or explain a person‚Äôs actions, looking at the social norms, and the person‚Äôs context, is usually a pretty safe bet. Situational constraints typically predict behavior far better than personality, intelligence, or other individual-level traits.
So when I see a student failing to complete assignments, missing deadlines, or not delivering results in other aspects of their life, I‚Äôm moved to ask: what are the situational factors holding this student back? What needs are currently not being met? And, when it comes to behavioral ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù, I‚Äôm especially moved to ask: what are the barriers to action that I can‚Äôt see?
There are always barriers. Recognizing those barriers‚Äî and viewing them as legitimate ‚Äî is often the first step to breaking ‚Äúlazy‚Äù behavior patterns.
...
It‚Äôs really helpful to respond to a person‚Äôs ineffective behavior with curiosity rather than judgment. I learned this from a friend of mine, the writer and activist Kimberly Longhofer (who publishes under Mik Everett). Kim is passionate about the acceptance and accommodation of disabled people and homeless people. Their writing about both subjects is some of the most illuminating, bias-busting work I‚Äôve ever encountered. Part of that is because Kim is brilliant, but it‚Äôs also because at various points in their life, Kim has been both disabled and homeless.
Kim is the person who taught me that judging a homeless person for wanting to buy alcohol or cigarettes is utter folly. When you‚Äôre homeless, the nights are cold, the world is unfriendly, and everything is painfully uncomfortable. Whether you‚Äôre sleeping under a bridge, in a tent, or at a shelter, it‚Äôs hard to rest easy. You are likely to have injuries or chronic conditions that bother you persistently, and little access to medical care to deal with it. You probably don‚Äôt have much healthy food.
In that chronically uncomfortable, over-stimulating context, needing a drink or some cigarettes makes fucking sense. As Kim explained to me, if you‚Äôre laying out in the freezing cold, drinking some alcohol may be the only way to warm up and get to sleep. If you‚Äôre under-nourished, a few smokes may be the only thing that kills the hunger pangs. And if you‚Äôre dealing with all this while also fighting an addiction, then yes, sometimes you just need to score whatever will make the withdrawal symptoms go away, so you can survive.
Few people who haven‚Äôt been homeless think this way. They want to moralize the decisions of poor people, perhaps to comfort themselves about the injustices of the world. For many, it‚Äôs easier to think homeless people are, in part, responsible for their suffering than it is to acknowledge the situational factors.
And when you don‚Äôt fully understand a person‚Äôs context ‚Äî what it feels like to be them every day, all the small annoyances and major traumas that define their life ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to impose abstract, rigid expectations on a person‚Äôs behavior. All homeless people should put down the bottle and get to work. Never mind that most of them have mental health symptoms and physical ailments, and are fighting constantly to be recognized as human. Never mind that they are unable to get a good night‚Äôs rest or a nourishing meal for weeks or months on end. Never mind that even in my comfortable, easy life, I can‚Äôt go a few days without craving a drink or making an irresponsible purchase. They have to do better.
But they‚Äôre already doing the best they can. I‚Äôve known homeless people who worked full-time jobs, and who devoted themselves to the care of other people in their communities. A lot of homeless people have to navigate bureaucracies constantly, interfacing with social workers, case workers, police officers, shelter staff, Medicaid staff, and a slew of charities both well-meaning and condescending. It‚Äôs a lot of fucking work to be homeless. And when a homeless or poor person runs out of steam and makes a ‚Äúbad decision‚Äù, there‚Äôs a damn good reason for it.
If a person‚Äôs behavior doesn‚Äôt make sense to you, it is because you are missing a part of their context. It‚Äôs that simple. I‚Äôm so grateful to Kim and their writing for making me aware of this fact. No psychology class, at any level, taught me that. But now that it is a lens that I have, I find myself applying it to all kinds of behaviors that are mistaken for signs of moral failure ‚Äî and I‚Äôve yet to find one that can‚Äôt be explained and empathized with.
...
Let‚Äôs look at a sign of academic ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù that I believe is anything but: procrastination.
People love to blame procrastinators for their behavior. Putting off work sure looks lazy, to an untrained eye. Even the people who are actively doing the procrastinating can mistake their behavior for laziness. You‚Äôre supposed to be doing something, and you‚Äôre not doing it ‚Äî that‚Äôs a moral failure right? That means you‚Äôre weak-willed, unmotivated, and lazy, doesn‚Äôt it?
For decades, psychological research has been able to explain procrastination as a functioning problem, not a consequence of laziness. When a person fails to begin a project that they care about, it‚Äôs typically due to either a) anxiety about their attempts not being ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù or b) confusion about what the first steps of the task are. Not laziness. In fact, procrastination is more likely when the task is meaningful and the individual cares about doing it well.
When you‚Äôre paralyzed with fear of failure, or you don‚Äôt even know how to begin a massive, complicated undertaking, it‚Äôs damn hard to get shit done. It has nothing to do with desire, motivation, or moral upstandingness. Procastinators can will themselves to work for hours; they can sit in front of a blank word document, doing nothing else, and torture themselves; they can pile on the guilt again and again ‚Äî none of it makes initiating the task any easier. In fact, their desire to get the damn thing done may worsen their stress and make starting the task harder.
The solution, instead, is to look for what is holding the procrastinator back. If anxiety is the major barrier, the procrastinator actually needs to walk away from the computer/book/word document and engage in a relaxing activity. Being branded ‚Äúlazy‚Äù by other people is likely to lead to the exact opposite behavior.
Often, though, the barrier is that procrastinators have executive functioning challenges ‚Äî they struggle to divide a large responsibility into a series of discrete, specific, and ordered tasks. Here‚Äôs an example of executive functioning in action: I completed my dissertation (from proposal to data collection to final defense) in a little over a year. I was able to write my dissertation pretty easily and quickly because I knew that I had to a) compile research on the topic, b) outline the paper, c) schedule regular writing periods, and d) chip away at the paper, section by section, day by day, according to a schedule I had pre-determined.
Nobody had to teach me to slice up tasks like that. And nobody had to force me to adhere to my schedule. Accomplishing tasks like this is consistent with how my analytical, hyper-focused, Autistic little brain works. Most people don‚Äôt have that ease. They need an external structure to keep them writing ‚Äî regular writing group meetings with friends, for example ‚Äî and deadlines set by someone else. When faced with a major, massive project, most people want advice for how to divide it into smaller tasks, and a timeline for completion. In order to track progress, most people require organizational tools, such as a to-do list, calendar, datebook, or syllabus.
Needing or benefiting from such things doesn‚Äôt make a person lazy. It just means they have needs. The more we embrace that, the more we can help people thrive.
...
I had a student who was skipping class. Sometimes I‚Äôd see her lingering near the building, right before class was about to start, looking tired. Class would start, and she wouldn‚Äôt show up. When she was present in class, she was a bit withdrawn; she sat in the back of the room, eyes down, energy low. She contributed during small group work, but never talked during larger class discussions.
A lot of my colleagues would look at this student and think she was lazy, disorganized, or apathetic. I know this because I‚Äôve heard how they talk about under-performing students. There‚Äôs often rage and resentment in their words and tone ‚Äî why won‚Äôt this student take my class seriously? Why won‚Äôt they make me feel important, interesting, smart?
But my class had a unit on mental health stigma. It‚Äôs a passion of mine, because I‚Äôm a neuroatypical psychologist. I know how unfair my field is to people like me. The class & I talked about the unfair judgments people levy against those with mental illness; how depression is interpreted as laziness, how mood swings are framed as manipulative, how people with ‚Äúsevere‚Äù mental illnesses are assumed incompetent or dangerous.
The quiet, occasionally-class-skipping student watched this discussion with keen interest. After class, as people filtered out of the room, she hung back and asked to talk to me. And then she disclosed that she had a mental illness and was actively working to treat it. She was busy with therapy and switching medications, and all the side effects that entails. Sometimes, she was not able to leave the house or sit still in a classroom for hours. She didn‚Äôt dare tell her other professors that this was why she was missing classes and late, sometimes, on assignments; they‚Äôd think she was using her illness as an excuse. But she trusted me to understand.
And I did. And I was so, so angry that this student was made to feel responsible for her symptoms. She was balancing a full course load, a part-time job, and ongoing, serious mental health treatment. And she was capable of intuiting her needs and communicating them with others. She was a fucking badass, not a lazy fuck. I told her so.
She took many more classes with me after that, and I saw her slowly come out of her shell. By her Junior and Senior years, she was an active, frank contributor to class ‚Äî she even decided to talk openly with her peers about her mental illness. During class discussions, she challenged me and asked excellent, probing questions. She shared tons of media and current-events examples of psychological phenomena with us. When she was having a bad day, she told me, and I let her miss class. Other professors ‚Äî including ones in the psychology department ‚Äî remained judgmental towards her, but in an environment where her barriers were recognized and legitimized, she thrived.
...
Over the years, at that same school, I encountered countless other students who were under-estimated because the barriers in their lives were not seen as legitimate. There was the young man with OCD who always came to class late, because his compulsions sometimes left him stuck in place for a few moments. There was the survivor of an abusive relationship, who was processing her trauma in therapy appointments right before my class each week. There was the young woman who had been assaulted by a peer ‚Äî and who had to continue attending classes with that peer, while the school was investigating the case.
These students all came to me willingly, and shared what was bothering them. Because I discussed mental illness, trauma, and stigma in my class, they knew I would be understanding. And with some accommodations, they blossomed academically. They gained confidence, made attempts at assignments that intimidated them, raised their grades, started considering graduate school and internships. I always found myself admiring them. When I was a college student, I was nowhere near as self-aware. I hadn‚Äôt even begun my lifelong project of learning to ask for help.
...
Students with barriers were not always treated with such kindness by my fellow psychology professors. One colleague, in particular, was infamous for providing no make-up exams and allowing no late arrivals. No matter a student‚Äôs situation, she was unflinchingly rigid in her requirements. No barrier was insurmountable, in her mind; no limitation was acceptable. People floundered in her class. They felt shame about their sexual assault histories, their anxiety symptoms, their depressive episodes. When a student who did poorly in her classes performed well in mine, she was suspicious.
It‚Äôs morally repugnant to me that any educator would be so hostile to the people they are supposed to serve. It‚Äôs especially infuriating, that the person enacting this terror was a psychologist. The injustice and ignorance of it leaves me teary every time I discuss it. It‚Äôs a common attitude in many educational circles, but no student deserves to encounter it.
...
I know, of course, that educators are not taught to reflect on what their students‚Äô unseen barriers are. Some universities pride themselves on refusing to accommodate disabled or mentally ill students ‚Äî they mistake cruelty for intellectual rigor. And, since most professors are people who succeeded academically with ease, they have trouble taking the perspective of someone with executive functioning struggles, sensory overloads, depression, self-harm histories, addictions, or eating disorders. I can see the external factors that lead to these problems. Just as I know that ‚Äúlazy‚Äù behavior is not an active choice, I know that judgmental, elitist attitudes are typically borne out of situational ignorance.
And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this piece. I‚Äôm hoping to awaken my fellow educators ‚Äî of all levels ‚Äî to the fact that if a student is struggling, they probably aren‚Äôt choosing to. They probably want to do well. They probably are trying. More broadly, I want all people to take a curious and empathic approach to individuals whom they initially want to judge as ‚Äúlazy‚Äù or irresponsible.
If a person can‚Äôt get out of bed, something is making them exhausted. If a student isn‚Äôt writing papers, there‚Äôs some aspect of the assignment that they can‚Äôt do without help. If an employee misses deadlines constantly, something is making organization and deadline-meeting difficult. Even if a person is actively choosing to self-sabotage, there‚Äôs a reason for it ‚Äî some fear they‚Äôre working through, some need not being met, a lack of self-esteem being expressed.
People do not choose to fail or disappoint. No one wants to feel incapable, apathetic, or ineffective. If you look at a person‚Äôs action (or inaction) and see only laziness, you are missing key details. There is always an explanation. There are always barriers. Just because you can‚Äôt see them, or don‚Äôt view them as legitimate, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not there. Look harder.
Maybe you weren‚Äôt always able to look at human behavior this way. That‚Äôs okay. Now you are. Give it a try.

Awoken from a nice long afternoon nap, the old crocodile glanced at the young crocodile with one of his reptilian eyes, said nothing and then fell back asleep atop the water.
Feeling frustrated and disrespected, the young crocodile swam off upriver to chase after some catfish, leaving behind a flurry of bubbles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show him‚Äù, he thought to himself.
Later that day the young crocodile returned to the old crocodile who was still napping and began to brag to him about his successful hunt,
Unphased the old crocodile again looked at the young crocodile, said nothing, closed his eyes and continued to float atop the water as tiny minnows muched away lightly at the algae on his underbelly.
Again, the young crocodile was angry he couldn‚Äôt get a response from the elder, and he swam off a second time upstream to see what he could hunt.
After a few hours of thrashing about he was able to hunt down a small crane. Smiling, he kept the bird in his jaws and swam back to the old crocodile, adamant about showing him who the true hunter was.
As the young crocodile rounded the bend, he saw the elder crocodile still floating in the same spot near the river‚Äôs edge.
However, something had changed ‚Äî a large wildebeest was enjoying an afternoon drink just inches near the old crocodile‚Äôs head.
In one lightning fast movement, the old crocodile bolted out of the water, wrapped his jaws around the great wildebeest and pulled him under the river.
Awestruck the young crocodile swam up with the tiny bird hanging from his mouth and watched as the old crocodile enjoyed his 500 lb meal.
The young crocodile asked him, ‚ÄúPlease... tell me... how... how did you do that?‚Äù
Through mouthfuls of wildebeest, the old crocodile finally responded,
When I was first building JotForm, I was a lot like the young crocodile ‚Äî believing that I always had to be doing something to get results.
Back then, if someone would have told me that I would see greater results by spending more time doing nothing, I would have rolled my eyes and continued to chip away at my 16 hour day of work.
I thought that in order to be successful, I had to constantly be building, working, growing and developing the next thing ‚Äî whatever that ‚Äúthing‚Äù was.
All of us have a problem with busyness. But being busy and being successful are not one in the same. And, I think if we were to make ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù more of a priority, we might find ourselves catching more wildebeests versus measly catfish.
It worked for me, and I hope it can work for you, too.
But, doing less or nothing at all is easier said than done, especially in a society that suffers from extreme busyness. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at our unhealthy obsession with staying busy...
Mankind has struggled with busyness since the beginning of time ‚Äî or at least since 425 BC when Homer walked the Earth.
The Odyssey tells the tale of the Lotus-eaters ‚Äî a strange people that slothed around all day long eating lotus and doing nothing. And, what was stranger than fiction was that these people were content with their lives.
Homer wrote that after some of Odysseus‚Äôs crew ate the Lotus-eaters Lotus fruit (say that three times fast), they became like the Lotus-eaters ‚Äî content, relaxed and a bit lethargic.
Terrified that if all of his men ate the lotus fruit they would be unmotivated to return home, Odysseus ordered the affected men to be tied to the ship benches and for the ship to set sail immediately.
It ‚Äôs interesting, Odysseus‚Äôs reaction to this feeling of ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù sounds similar to the Corporate CEO, the Startup Founder and the collegiate football coach we know today ‚Äî hardcore workaholics that despise anything that might allude to a sense of complacency.
Though, they of course are just the tip of a much larger societal iceberg that feels frozen with fear at the thought of doing nothing.
The world as a whole now measures value in terms of busyness versus quality of work. In many ways, it has become something of a status symbol to be ‚Äúbusy‚Äù.
How many times have you heard or had a conversation like this...
We‚Äôve grown to subconsciously measure a person‚Äôs worth based off how many hours they work, how much is on their plate and put simply ‚Äî whether or not they are running around like a chicken with their head cut off.
In Tim Ferriss‚Äôs 4-Hour Work Week, he pokes fun at this idea by facetiously saying that if you want a promotion, you should appear to be more busy by working longer hours, scrambling around and constantly answering emails.
But, sooner or later, all of us have to ask ourselves what our mission is ‚Äî is it to be the busiest or is it to make the most impact?
And, what‚Äôs fascinating is that when we look at some of the greatest minds to grace planet Earth, we see an interesting commonality ‚Äî they all make time for doing nothing.
Making time in your life to do nothing can be challenging ‚Äî especially during the work week where we are constantly pummeled and bombarded with meetings, notifications and an ever growing list of tasks.
Busy founders have started implementing ‚ÄúThink Weeks‚Äù into their annual schedules ‚Äî week long periods they spend reflecting, reading, thinking and living outside the all-encapsulating world that is running a business.
While young founders like Skillshare‚Äôs Mike Karnjanaprakorn have adopted this practice, as well as big names like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Ferriss, it was Bill Gates who originally made the Think Week famous.
For many years while running Microsoft, Gates would retreat into week long Think Weeks twice a year ‚Äî not vacations, but actual periods of time dedicated to doing nothing.
Gates was so adamant about his Think Weeks that family, friends and Microsoft employees were banned. Today, Gates attributes much of Microsoft‚Äôs success to the big ideas and concepts he stumbled upon while doing nothing.
You don‚Äôt necessarily have to ban family and friends to retreat into a Think Week, though. Take me as an example.
Every year, I take at least a full week off from my company and head back to my hometown to help my parents with the olive harvest.
All thoughts of startup growth or conversion rates slip away when you‚Äôre picking olives. It‚Äôs meditative and calming.
I know that olive picking won‚Äôt land me at the top of TechCrunch, but it‚Äôs a personal measure of success. And somehow, some of my best ideas come to me during this period.
For someone who can‚Äôt take an entire week off of work once a year to do nothing, I recommend taking a slightly different approach ‚Äî embracing the digital sabbath.
On either Saturday or Sunday, force yourself to step away from all forms of technology ‚Äî a practice known as a digital sabbath.
Shut off your smartphone and hide it in your closet. Powerdown the laptop and slide it under your bed. And, try with all your might to refrain from binge-watching Netflix.
Give your brain space to think by stepping away from the daily grind and doing nothing. Your mind will have time to stumble upon new ideas and further process old ones.
You may find the success that results from this practice to be similar to that of the old crocodile at the beginning of this article.
While we tell ourselves we can achieve more by scrambling, sometimes it‚Äôs better to close our eyes and just float.
And, wait, until the wildebeest shows up.

However, if you take the time to follow the steps in this article you will be more productive, more focused, and ‚Äî I‚Äôm not joking at all ‚Äî live longer.
Practically every iPhone setup decision has tradeoffs. I will give you optimal defaults and then trust you to make an adult decision about whether that default is right for you.
In addition, because this is a long post, I‚Äôve written it in a way to make it easier to skim. Here‚Äôs how to read the post:
As a bonus, because I know you got excited when you saw this was a seventy minute read, I‚Äôve gone all out on getting pedantic about productivity and even included three appendixes to give an overview of the behavior design principles, to break out the potential financial budget for implementing this advice, and then a real-world example from my own phone.
Also, for convenience, here is a clickable table of contents. (The links below work if you‚Äôre reading in a browser, but not if you‚Äôre reading in the app.)
Open the Apple Settings App, then go to the Notifications Section. You‚Äôre going to need to get good at opening the Settings app, so learn to find this icon:
Go app by app, turning off all notifications.
By the end, the vast majority of your apps should have a notifications setting that looks like this, i.e with no notifications:
There are only a very few reasons to leave notifications on for a particular app. Here are those reasons:
I led with this advice to turn off notifications because it‚Äôs the most powerful. Also, you‚Äôre never going to finish reading this post if you leave your notifications turned on.
These are the productivity reasons that should make you wary of notifications.
#1: Notifications are uncontrolled interruptions from your real goals. They prevent you from ever getting into a flow state. You should be in control of what you do and when ‚Äî not your phone. I‚Äôm going to refer to this over and over as ‚Äúyour phone is a tool, not a boss.‚Äù See Appendix A at the end of this article for more.
#2: The brain science behind learning requires sustained focus to trigger myelin growth around active neural pathways. That‚Äôs what brain plasticity is about. However, if you go around interrupting that process, you‚Äôll never get the myelin growth that locks in whatever you were learning. Essentially, notifications lead to a stunted life.
#3: Those red dots cause anxiety, and anxiety causes health problems like heart disease. It‚Äôs not hyperbole that I talked about life expectancy in the title of this post. Not specific to red dots, but mild anxiety was shown to increase mortality by 20% over a ten year period.
‚ÄòSlot machine apps‚Äô is a pejorative phrase to refer to apps that use variable rate rewards to try to trigger mindless and addictive behavior. That‚Äôs how the app tries to become your boss ‚Äî although maybe boss isn‚Äôt even a strong enough word. These are virtual drugs and due to societal oversight, your dealer (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat) is allowed to pose as a respectable member of society.
Thankfully, you can configure all of your social media to eliminate the addictive elements.
This last trick comes from Tristan Harris.
Here‚Äôs what I mean. When your addictions are in the first screen of a folder, they‚Äôre still visibly calling out to you. Still bad:
Instead, move your apps to the second screen of that folder, like so (the first screen has just one app, the second screen has the rest):
This second-screen-of-folder-on-second-screen strategy requires that at least one app be visible. When you reach this decision point for social media apps, you obviously should choose LinkedIn. It‚Äôs the least addictive.
Extra credit for people that are actual productivity nuts: just delete all your social media apps.
This is the same strategy as #2, just for messaging apps. Messaging apps also have a built-in variable rate reward ‚Äî that‚Äôs what makes them slot machines.
The productivity secret for inbox management is to decide when you want to check your messages. Then, process them all in one big batch. Batch processing puts you in control. Unfortunately, most people live life reactively, constantly checking their inboxes for messages to react to. For you to reach your full potential, you need to switch to a batch processing mindset for all of your inboxes.
These messaging apps should never interrupt you. This goes back to the brain science justification in #1. You want to block off your day so that you have some contiguous time dedicated to being smart and creative (no interruptions) and then other blocks dedicated to rapid task processing (email, etc.). Cal Newport calls this Deep Work (in a very good book).
Productivity nuts: consider deleting all of these apps. People who set a schedule for when and where they check their inboxes often realize they can do all of their emailing from a proper computer. For Slack users, private messages and channel notifications are meant to be asynchronous ‚Äî that means you don‚Äôt need immediate alerts.
You open an app intending to get work done, and then that app prompts you to leave a review. This is an unwanted interruption, and your job is to remove as many interruptions as possible.
So disable these unwanted Review Requests.
Is it crazy how we think of computers as productivity devices but then allow so many unproductive features? I think it‚Äôs crazy. This isn‚Äôt just some app-developer hack, it‚Äôs actually a built-in feature provided by Apple. That‚Äôs how blind Apple is to the damage caused by interrupting your work flow.
What‚Äôs happening with review requests is that when you use free apps, you are actually entering a partnership with the app developer where you are working on their behalf, often by clicking on advertisements, or in the case of app reviews, by acting as marketing.
Apps with more positive reviews get ranked higher by Apple. As a consequence, app developers tend to interrupt you with review requests just as you‚Äôre doing something productive.
Do you care about the morality of opting out of this partnership? A savvy user can often leach off of the hard work of app developers and the money of investors without giving anything back. I‚Äôve been doing that with the MoviePass service ‚Äî seeing twice as many movies as I paid for, all subsidized by some venture capital investors. (Unfortunately, that gravy train seems to be ending.)
When you or I do take advantage, we‚Äôre basically stealing. This sort of stealing is not illegal, but is it bad for your health? The impact off morality on longevity is muddy. As close as I could find was research on religious vs. non-religious people within the same country.
If you‚Äôre worried about the effect of morality on your longevity, here a few workarounds. Manually go to the App Store, look through your recently updated apps, and add reviews to each of them. Share your favorite apps with your friends (as I‚Äôm doing in this post). Or, opt for the pro or paid versions. I‚Äôm finding that I almost always prefer to pay for an app.
Most people should have their phone permanently on Do Not Disturb.
Do Not Disturb is not as severe as you might think, thanks to a sub-feature to ‚ÄúAllow Calls From Favorites.‚Äù As a result, you can still allow certain people to interrupt you or wake you up.
The trick to getting the Do Not Disturb feature to work all day is to turn it on from the same time to the same time, such as from 9am to 9am. I tested it and that works (I was worried it would effectively turn itself on and off again in the same minute).
If, however, you do want strangers to be able to contact you (for example, if you work in sales), then just set Do Not Disturb for your sleep and leisure time.
The justification here is similar to the steps above. Limited interruptions is smart for a number of reasons, including the science of brain plasticity, the health impact of anxiety, and the productivity gains of optimizing for deep work (all covered in more depth in Appendix A below).
What the above Do Not Disturb setting allows you to do is to take a ‚Äòwhitelist‚Äô strategy to interruptions. So rather than banning telemarketers one-by-one (‚Äòblacklisting‚Äô), you pre-select the very limited number of people who you would allow to interrupt your day. For me, that‚Äôs my immediate family, my dog walker, and my dog‚Äôs vet.
The absolute best wallpaper is an all black background. Choosing black destroys the idea that your phone is some shiny toy that you need to be looking at all the time.
Plus, with OLED screens (most new iPhones), black actually saves battery (as much as 60%). If you chronically run out of battery or are a true productivity nut, then black is the best option for you.
If you can‚Äôt stomach making a thousand dollar phone look that ugly, choose the black with rainbow stripe option that‚Äôs right next to the black option in the Stills. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done for all the screen shots in this article.
There are other options:
If you‚Äôre shy, choose a wallpaper that will help as a conversation starter.
If you find inspirational images inspiring:
One problem with inspirational images is that words often make your phone feel cluttered. It‚Äôs better to have an image, like a mountain or a person working out, than it is to have a quote or motivational phrase. For example, here‚Äôs a reasonable set of affirmations that just don‚Äôt show up well behind various iPhone icons and widgets.
If you are going to have affirmation or motivational text, a quick hack is to make the background yourself in Instagram Stories. Instagram will let you save the Story to your phone‚Äôs Photos.
In this case, try to stick to just a single word, and place that word low enough that it shows up below your Do-Not-Disturb message. If you take this approach, consider two things:
Here‚Äôs an example Jonathan Howard sent me when he was reviewing a draft of this article:
If you still haven‚Äôt found a suitable strategy, pick an image with a dominant color that tells a color story to prompt one of the below emotions.
Don‚Äôt pick orange (cheap) or yellow (warning). If you‚Äôre not sure? Pick Red. All of these color choices will drain your battery more than a black background, but you may find the emotional gain to be worthwhile.
The reality for me is that I alternate between a black background and a meaningful picture. There‚Äôs some possible science supporting the value of small changes to your work environment to create a boost in productivity. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt find a citation, although I‚Äôm 90% certain I read this in David Rock‚Äôs Your Brain at Work. The theory is basically that shaking up your environment a small amount puts your brain on alert (but not so much that you‚Äôre anxious).
The Raise to Wake feature lets you quickly see notifications on your lock screen just by lifting your phone.
This is a bad idea. You don‚Äôt want to accidentally see notifications on your lock screen when you just happen to be moving your phone around. You want only see notifications intentionally.
Winners check their notifications on their own schedule.
This is yet another setting to make sure you‚Äôre the boss and your phone is your tool.
The Screen Time widget is new from Apple and it helps show you where your time is going. Ideally, the Social Media category will be non-existent. Unsurprisingly, I‚Äôm not going to be able to find a screen shot where that is true.
To install the Screen Time widget:
You‚Äôre going to use this widget as a reality check against your own biased memory.
This article is going to recommend a few more widgets later, and then recommend that you build the habit of checking the Today View by swiping right from your home screen (conceptually, it lives to the left of your home screen).
It does seem to be roughly true that what gets measured gets done. There are a number of variants of that quote, but my favorite is ‚ÄúWhat gets measured gets done, what gets measured and fed back gets done well, what gets rewarded gets repeated.‚Äù
A goal for many of the steps in this article is for you to use your phone less, and to use social media apps much, much less.
This widget is how you‚Äôll know if you‚Äôre succeeding. I consider it the feedback part of the above quote. Then hopefully the reward is an intrinsic satisfaction in your own life and productivity.
In addition to installing the widget, you should set yourself a goal for social media usage. Imagine you had a child and were setting a limit for how much television they could watch each day. Is one hour reasonable? Probably. Is six hours reasonable? No.
Now, instead of this child, consider instead that you are setting limits for yourself, and that social media has replaced your television watching time. How much ‚Äúleisure‚Äù time each day do you think is appropriate for yourself? If you‚Äôre not sure, choose thirty minutes. That‚Äôs enough time to scan your Facebook and Instagram, drop tons of likes on your friends, tweet once, get the gist of the news, and consume a huge dose of We Rate Dogs.
Sometimes it‚Äôs helpful to block yourself from certain websites. I have zero pride preventing me from treating myself like a toddler in need of parental controls. The reality is that we all could use some strict blocks to prevent our worst habits.
On the iPhone, the feature to block specific websites is hidden inside of Apple‚Äôs Limit Adult Websites feature.
I‚Äôm not trying to make any point at all about your adult website usage. I just want to help you find the feature (and it‚Äôs the most deeply buried feature in this article).
Turning on this feature allows you to then add specific websites, which don‚Äôt have to be adult websites at all.
What you should consider is whether you have any habitual behaviors around checking specific websites and then use this feature to break those habits. For example, I used to live in San Francisco and so had a habit of checking the website for the daily paper. That‚Äôs the one site I block because I don‚Äôt want to have that habit anymore.
Additionally, I was a huge Grantland reader before it was shut down by ESPN. I still type that URL into my browser just out of pure muscle memory.
If I were designing content restrictions for productivity, I‚Äôd have one called Google-only, which would allow you to Google any term and then click any result. But you‚Äôd be blocked from going directly to any sites or clicking deeper into any site.
However, since I‚Äôm not the boss at Apple, the solution above is the best available approach and is probably ideal for most people. I‚Äôll give a more hardcore solution next.
None of you are going to do this... but I tried a month with no access to a web browser. If you are up for this, I definitely want to hear from you.
The theory is that the browser is one of the addictive slot machines that draws your attention and wastes your time.
So I used parental controls to disable Safari.
In practice, I would very occasionally need a web browser, so I‚Äôd download the Chrome app, do my browsing, and then delete the Chrome app.
If this method of reclaiming your phone at all appeals to you, here‚Äôs the secret:
When I tested this, I used Chrome as my occasional browser because the path for removing access again was shorter. I trusted myself more to delete the Chrome app than to remember to find the Safari restriction option that‚Äôs hidden behind five taps.
There are four ways to organize your apps: by function, by color, by random chance, and alphabetically.
You‚Äôre going to organize your screens by function, and you‚Äôre also going to organize apps into folders by function. The home screen is for tools only. The second screen is apps organized into folders. The third screen is for junk, namely Apple apps you aren‚Äôt allowed to remove.
However, on each screen and within each folder you have to make additional decisions about organizing. You should choose alphabetically.
The phrase ‚Äúyour phone is a tool, not your boss‚Äù is implying that you‚Äôre the boss. But it‚Äôs more subtle than that.
We want to set your phone up so that your rational brain is the boss, and your emotional, addictive, worst-decisions brain is asleep or blocked.
The best explanation for this is in the book, Thinking, Fast and Slow (or just read the NYT book review for a good overview). The author lays out a model for the brain as having two systems.
The Fast system is our default. It‚Äôs effortless, instinctual, and functional for staying alive, but also the source of most of our worst impulses. It‚Äôs the system that likes slot machine apps.
The Slow system is what we think of as our rational brain. It‚Äôs analytical, but requires effort and intention to access.
When I train meditation in my Heavy Mental program, I train a verbal way of moving the thoughts that come up during a meditation into our Slow system. That way we can analyze the thought, and then drop it. The entire trick is that activating your language center always activates your Slow system.
Here, we‚Äôre doing something very similar. When you go for an app, I want you to have the actual name of the app in mind. That way it‚Äôs easier for you to be acting rationally and intentionally. That‚Äôs the main reason to adopt an alphabetical organizing structure.
The second good reason is that alphabetical is less brittle. Organizing by function is hard because sometimes apps have more than one function. Organizing by app name is intellectually trivial in comparison.
For the vast majority of people, the ideal phone setup is to embrace Google Cloud services (mail, calendar, photos, maps) and pair them with Apple hardware.
If you‚Äôre on some other setup, like Apple email or Outlook, then stick with that. It‚Äôs not worth switching.
You can often configure the Apple apps to connect to the Google services. But it‚Äôs always better to just use the Google-specific app. In this case, I‚Äôm going to talk about Gmail.
Don‚Äôt use Apple‚Äôs Mail product. Google‚Äôs actual Gmail app just works more smoothly, especially search.
And don‚Äôt bother with any app that promises any sort of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù filtering or sorting of your email. Relying on somebody else‚Äôs algorithms is hugely overrated.
I hosted a Q&A with Marshall Hughes, who is our most prolific Inbox Zero coach. Yes, that‚Äôs a type of coach ‚Äî a lot of our coaches zero (do you like my pun?) in on specific behavior changes.
In the Q&A, everyone wanted to ask Marshall about email automation tools. And Marshall was adamant that every experience he had with clients using automation tools turned out badly. Clients who chose automation were bailing on essential inbox habits. They‚Äôd given up on the most important habit of all, which is to say no to email by constantly unsubscribing and manually filtering.
So, paired with the settings above, you should be working on your email habits. That means primarily unsubscribing and blocking aggressively. I get a lot of extra email too that I consider FYI ‚Äî for example, I like having a history of all of the newsletters we send out, but I don‚Äôt need to read each one as they come in to my inbox. I filter those into folders and only check those folders occasionally.
Sticking with the Google Cloud theme, use the native Google Calendar app and ignore Apple‚Äôs Calendar app.
The two most important subtleties are trying to shorten meetings and building a Today screen that‚Äôs worthy of a daily habit.
The Today habit is just you starting your day by getting a summary of what‚Äôs planned (and later, what the weather is like). If you can build this habit, then you can use it to trigger new habits.
In the Tiny Habits method, checking your calendar would be called an anchor habit. Above in the Screen Time section, I‚Äôve already attached a new, not-quite-natural habit of checking your Screen Time widget. The reason I think that will work is because I trust that you will naturally want to check the calendar and weather, thus triggering the new and less natural habit of checking additional widgets.
On the short meetings front, this is literally a chance to save yourself hours each day by making the meetings you go to shorter and more focused. The key to focus is to have a clear goal, and push directly toward that goal.
I have one friend, a CEO, who wants the time on his calendar to be as precious as the time on a U.S. president‚Äôs schedule (he told me this during a different administration). If a meeting only needs seven minutes, then just give it seven minutes. A different friend, also a CEO, set a company policy that if a meeting invite didn‚Äôt include goals, an agenda, and pre-meeting preparation, you could skip it. The acronym there is GAP ‚Äî no GAP, no need to attend.
Last, in my screenshot there‚Äôs a massive amount of time blocked off called ‚ÄúReserved.‚Äù I‚Äôm unapologetic about scheduling time on my calendar for deep work. You can‚Äôt squeeze deep work into fifteen minute gaps ‚Äî you need to carve out contiguous blocks of time. For most office workers, I use what Cal Newport calls a ‚Äúbi-modal day.‚Äù That‚Äôs where half of my day is for deep work and the other is for shallow work, i.e. meetings, email, phone calls.
Apple Maps has gotten better, but it‚Äôs still not as good as Google Maps. You‚Äôre only going to use Apple Maps when you use Siri (it‚Äôs Siri‚Äôs permanent default).
Every other time, you‚Äôre going to use Google Maps.
This is yet another example of preferring the Google Cloud. And the custom settings for Home and Work are just small time-savers. There‚Äôs not a huge additional productivity explanation.
This will let you type faster through swiping. The world record for typing on a phone is set through the swipe method: just swipe your finger over the letters of the word you‚Äôre trying to type. The keyboard will figure out what you mean.
At first this will feel a little uncomfortable, but it will quickly become second nature.
Gboard, from Google, also has a bunch more features too like GIF and emoji search.
I found that I was so unhappy with the Apple keyboard peck-typing that I‚Äôd avoid using it altogether. I‚Äôm a fast laptop typist, so I‚Äôd always postpone writing until I got to my desk.
Now, with swiping, I‚Äôm just a little bit faster and that‚Äôs the difference between not typing anything and being willing to type a longer message.
Where that ties into productivity is what a lot of people call the ‚Äútouch it once‚Äù principle. Especially with email, you want to avoid reading the same email twice. So if I happen to read a message that needs a response, I want to give that response right away.
This is the last of the settings to use the Google Cloud over Apple‚Äôs built-in options.
The main benefit of Google Photos is that the search is amazing. They use machine learning to categorize all of your photos so that you can later search them. For example, without any work I can find all my selfies by just searching for the word me. And I often pull up pictures of my dogs by searching for dog. I have even had someone pull up photos of a specific handcrafted greenland kayak paddle.
For photos, take the following steps.
I end up storing my photos in four places: Google photos, iCloud, laptop and Dropbox sync. That‚Äôs because I‚Äôm paranoid. I should probably take them out of Dropbox.
Of those, Google Photos is far and away the best experience for looking at my photos, thanks to the machine learning behind Google‚Äôs search. This is an example of where a messy-by-design organization structure beats rigid one. Search is more reliable and faster than you trying to manually categorize every photo.
If you already love your note taking app and to-do list app, then fine, stick with those. This is a recommendation where habits beat tools. Don‚Äôt switch if you already have strong habits.
However, if you don‚Äôt use a note taking app or to-do list app, or are unhappy with what you do use, let me give you a guiding theory that will lead you to Evernote: go messy and trust search.
Put your to-do list in Evernote, either by creating one long note that you edit every day or a new note for each day. Then put all your other notes in Evernote too. Don‚Äôt bother particularly with categorization. Instead, just trust that you‚Äôll be able to find whatever you want later through Evernote‚Äôs search.
What you end up with is a messy but long-term functional system. The other approach, constantly switching apps, systems, and categorization schemes always breaks. Always.
One power of a messy to-do list is that not everything has to be a check list item. You can mix in quick drafts and longer notes to yourself. Or, as I‚Äôve recommended in my Interstitial Journaling technique, to live mindfully, you should literally intermix short journal entries and to-do list items.
The problem with most productivity systems is that they break. As a result, a lot of productivity nuts spend a lot of their time creating new productivity systems over and over again. This, obviously, is not productive.
For that reason, where possible, I suggest that you choose messy systems over rigid systems. The ultimate messy system that I know you‚Äôre all familiar with is the paper notebook. A paper notebook gives you incredible flexibility: you can take notes however you want, write drafts, sketch outlines, draw pictures, write to-do lists, etc. A to-do list app just doesn‚Äôt allow for that.
The downside to paper notebooks is that it‚Äôs impossible (or at least very hard) to find an old note.
All of that is the argument for merging your to-do lists with your notes, and then putting them all into a single cloud-backed note taking system with good search features.
Although Evernote has advanced features that may or (probably) may not be a pleasure to use, the basics work well and reliably. I recommend starting with free and then upgrading ($60/year) if you bump into a limit on bandwidth or offline availability.
I learned to meditate from Headspace. That‚Äôs a good option. But guided meditation is something that you‚Äôll graduate from quickly. Most people I know who meditate don‚Äôt still need a daily guide.
Once you graduate to meditating on your own, Calm is the much better option because of their built-in timer and tracking. I was an advisor in the early days of Calm specifically because of my experience building habit tracking apps.
Meditation is a productivity and performance practice. The explanation for why is a little long, so I‚Äôm mostly just going to point you to longer articles we‚Äôve published in Better Humans. However, here‚Äôs the quick pitch for why the Calm app is about performance and not just ‚Äúcalm.‚Äù
A lot of people talk about meditation as a relaxing or spiritual practice. That‚Äôs fine for them. But you‚Äôre reading a productivity article, so I‚Äôm focused on what meditation does for your productivity.
The core concept comes from the world of deliberate practice, which is when you identify the components of skills that are important to your success, and then practice those components individually. I want you to approach meditation as a practice session for a skill that you‚Äôre going to use to help your productivity.
You should read our full article on Deliberate Practice to get a feel for how to design practice for all important life skills.
With meditation, you‚Äôre practicing a two-step process that you will use outside of the meditation. The first step is becoming aware of where your mind wandered, acknowledging the thought and then putting the thought down. Call that Awareness. The second step is bringing your focus back to your point of focus (usually your breath). Call that Focus.
This Awareness-Focus loop is what you are practicing during a meditation session. A lot of people feel bad if their mind wanders during meditation. But you should actually feel good. The more often your mind wanders, the more times you get to practice this Awareness-Focus loop. I tell people what they are doing is mental pushups. The more wandering they do, the more pushups they get in.
Now that you‚Äôve practiced, here‚Äôs a way to then apply the Awareness-Focus loop in ways to be more productive by beating procrastination.
There are basically two philosophies for how to use a goal tracker. Both involve picking a set of small goals or habits and marking them off in the app each time you do them.
In the Quantified Self philosophy of goal trackers, you are tracking your goals simply out of curiosity because you want to get more information about yourself. (The word Goal in Goal Tracker doesn‚Äôt even come into play.)
The second philosophy is focused on a goal-oriented behavior-change mindset where you are using the goal tracker for motivation and accountability in order to get yourself to adopt a new behavior and become a better person.
I simply do not understand the Quantified Self philosophy ‚Äî don‚Äôt they want to improve? Every time I go to a Quantified Self event, I feel like I‚Äôm surrounded by aliens who love data but not growth.
It just doesn‚Äôt make sense.
So my goal tracker recommendation is for a goal tracker I built. It is the foundation of the Coach.me community. Most users and most coaches started out by forming habits through this goal tracking app.
Install the Coach.me app and consider tracking a few of the 101 most tracked habits in 2018.
Obviously, I‚Äôm talking from my own book here. This article is the product of prior work that started with this goal tracker and then morphed into coaching and personal development publishing. There are many links out there to projects we built at Coach.me or articles we published at Better Humans.
So, with the caveat that I‚Äôm deeply biased, my position is that I‚Äôve seen all the other goal trackers and generally they all use similar formulas and then differentiate just a tiny bit on what graphs they show you.
However, we put every ounce of our design effort into something different: your psychology and motivation. That includes how we trigger reminders, how we try to avoid triggering guilt, how we introduce variable rate rewards for your own good, and how we handle when a goal is too challenging for you.
If you‚Äôve read this far in the article, I think you will have picked up on my philosophy, which is that I want to see results.
Trying to remember hundreds of passwords is a waste of time. Using the same password for all your accounts is the fast track to getting hacked.
There are a number of good third-party password managers that are much easier to use than Apple‚Äôs built in Keychain. If you are already using one, then stick with it. This is a principle (covered also in Appendix A) that habits are more important than tools. The benefits of your habits around your current password manager outweigh the feature benefits of switching to a different manager.
I use 1Password but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm going to recommend to you. I signed up with them a long time ago when they had a pay-once option. But now they‚Äôve moved to a subscription model that‚Äôs quite a bit more expensive than other better options.
So, if you are looking to use a password manager for the first time, then install LastPass. It‚Äôs the probably best for most people and definitely the least expensive at $24/year.
Download LastPass here. You‚Äôre going to need to set it up in three places: as an app on your phone, as an app on your computer, and as an extension in your computer‚Äôs web browser.
On your iPhone, you‚Äôll also need to configure LastPass to fill passwords in Safari. Select your password manager from iOS Settings > Passwords & Accounts > Autofill Passwords.
The theory behind the value of a password manager comes down to pragmatic security and reduced cognitive load.
Your parents used to memorize people‚Äôs phone numbers. Now nobody does that anymore. It should be the same with passwords ‚Äî you have better things to remember. That‚Äôs a cognitive load reduction.
Plus, password managers can save time. A common trap is to half-way embrace unique passwords for each app or site, but then find yourself constantly forgetting and having to go through a lost-password routine. This is wasted time.
On the security front, most people who don‚Äôt use a password manager end up reusing passwords. So when a hacker gets your password to one site, they get it for all sites. Password managers aren‚Äôt immune to getting hacked either, but at least if you use a popular one you‚Äôre likely to hear about it when the hack happens.
After accuracy, the must-have feature for calculators is a history. Otherwise you‚Äôre going to make a typo and not notice.
Unfortunately, Apple‚Äôs calculator does not ship with a history feature. So:
Notice the second line of numbers at the top? That‚Äôs a history. Having that history saves you time and reduces your errors because you can spot when you‚Äôve fat-fingered an entry. Reduce your anxiety and live longer.
‚ÄúEven people displaying minor symptoms of psychological distress were found to have a 20 percent increased risk of dying over the 10-year study period.‚Äù (This is the same citation I used in the section about turning off notifications.)
Technically, this is quadruply redundant.
You can swipe down to get the camera from your control center, tap the camera on the lock screen, or swipe left from your lock screen.
That last, swipe-left from the lock screen is really convenient. Practice that. But also add the camera to your toolbar.
The camera is a great tool for happiness and gratitude. I‚Äôm not talking about preening in front of the camera all day. I‚Äôm talking about capturing the most interesting moments of your day for posterity and to share with others.
Using your camera regularly also helps you develop an eye for detail.
The general theme of this article is to set your phone up to be more present in the world. Looking for pictures to take is one way to be more engaged with your surroundings. Stopping a meal so that you can capture your food, however, is not the path to living in the moment.
If you are wanting to post pictures to Instagram and Facebook, you can consider the placement of the Camera app to be a replacement habit that allows you to schedule your social media usage. Take a picture in the Camera app and then post it later, during your allotted leisure window.
What does 70% chance of rain mean? Sometimes it means there‚Äôs a 70% chance of rain over 100% of your area. But it can also mean there is 100% certainty of rain, but only over part of your 70% of your area.
That‚Äôs confusing. And so the only sane way to check the weather is to compare it to the Doppler radar. These radars visualize the rain and the direction that the rain is heading. That way you can eyeball for yourself if the rain is actually going to affect you.
Download the NOAA Radar app.
While you‚Äôre setting up weather, you should place this Doppler app on your home screen, and then go to your Today screen and turn on Apple‚Äôs Weather widget.
A big part of productivity is planning. You‚Äôve heard a million people complain about how inaccurate weather forecasting is. So here‚Äôs the solution: be your own forecaster.
The idea behind Pomodoro is to be fully focused for a set period of time, usually twenty-five minutes, and then have a five minute break.
This is a way to train yourself to avoid procrastination. You end up constantly pushing yourself a little bit harder to make it to the end of your work period, knowing that you‚Äôll get a short reward after.
The rules of Pomodoro aren‚Äôt complicated, but it‚Äôs still nice to have a dedicated app. There are two good ones, but I prefer BeFocused Pro for $2.99 because it can easily categorize your Pomodoros. For example, I‚Äôm currently in a Pomodoro that I marked for the Writing category.
When do you use Pomodoro? It‚Äôs useful for when you are doing individual work, like checking your email or working on a project. You wouldn‚Äôt use this method during a meeting.
This is one of a handful of strategies in this article for beating procrastination. My intention is that you use all of them at once. For example, the Meditation section is mostly focused on meditation as training that allows you to catch and overcome the feelings that lead to procrastination.
Pomodoro comes at procrastination from a different perspective. It makes for a smaller, more achievable goal. A lot of people get down on themselves if they can‚Äôt go an entire 8-hour work day without procrastinating. Pomodoro helps you set a more achievable goal, say 25 minutes. And if that‚Äôs too long, make your Pomodoro even shorter. You can always start small and build up to your final goal.
(The third main strategy for beating procrastination is next ‚Äî using Brain.fm for background noise.)
A lot of people have trained themselves to listen to music while they work. But almost all research says that performance is poorer in the presence of a background sound.
One obvious benefit, though, of music is social. You put on your headphones and people know not to bother you. I often wear headphones with no sound just to indicate to my coworkers that I‚Äôm busy.
The research, however, on music as a background noise is that it‚Äôs tricky ‚Äî there are occasional benefits to productivity but also many, many pitfalls. There is another approach: an emerging field of auditory science used to boost focus and reduce mind-wandering.
Brain.fm is the best of these brain music options.
Since I come from the world of coaching, I spend most of my time helping people apply behavior changes. As a result, I often end up in a place where I think I see certain advice working, but I don‚Äôt necessarily understand or trust the scientific explanation for why that advice works. That‚Äôs the case with Brain.fm.
My experience with Brain.fm is that it‚Äôs amazing and works exactly as advertised. Sometimes, without sound, my brain will have a tendency to wander. With the Brain.fm focus music, it some how shuts down that wandering during any dead spots in my work (like if I‚Äôm waiting for an app to load). As a result, I have more sustained periods of focus.
However, I find their explanation of the science to be inscrutable. It sounds exactly like the type of pop-culture brain science that lots of people spout. This doesn‚Äôt bother me, as long as it works.
However, Brain.fm have run studies funded by the National Science Foundation that back up my experience, which is that Brain.fm is better than silence and silence is better than music.
I need to emphasize that this is a corporate-run study that magically ended up with a self-serving result. So, more than the science, I just want you to take my word for it enough to try it out for yourself (remember, there‚Äôs a free trial).
Your podcast app should be on your home screen and you should train yourself to listen to podcasts during your commute, while cleaning, and during light cardio.
If you listen to podcasts on the bus or subway, here‚Äôs an important, little-known fact. It‚Äôs preferable to just listen! You don‚Äôt also have to be playing games and scrolling Instagram. Be a single-tasker.
The below are where most people should start when it comes to productivity and health podcasts.
Of course, Tim Ferriss is on this list. But I rounded him out so that you get a diverse set of ideas and approaches.
Do not approach your podcast subscriptions as if you need to listen to every episode. Instead, pick and choose the most recent episodes that feel relevant to you.
I‚Äôve never heard anyone who shares my reasoning for why and how to listen to productivity and health podcasts. Most people just think having more information is inherently good. That‚Äôs not my reason.
Information is never enough for making important changes. You need to get emotionally hooked, amped up and committed. The podcast format gives you a chance to connect with advice at an emotional level and really feel the social proof. That matters.
Second, most advice only works for some people some of the time. I‚Äôve written before that you should approach personal development advice as if it only has a 10% success rate. The obvious implication is that you‚Äôll always be needing to try lots of approaches until you find the one that works for you. Given that observation, it feels entirely natural to me that you would listen to both Jocko Willink and Gretchen Rubin.
Do not bother with cliff notes. There‚Äôs more value in being a slow reader, where the stories in the book can work on your emotions, and where your brain can roam freely to make connections between the words and your own world. So skip book summary apps like Blinklist, and embrace reading on the Kindle.
So, yes, install the Kindle app. This would be a good app for your home screen. Try to replace mindless social media usage with deep learning via either reading or podcasts.
But you‚Äôre probably not done.
Do you like to read before bed? Do not bring your phone to bed. That kills your sleep, bad sleep kills your health, and eventually your bad health is going to kill you. For the ‚ÄúHuman Longevity‚Äù promise of this article, buy a Kindle Paperwhite and put that next to your bed. If you‚Äôre an iPhone owner, you can afford this second device.
Do you want a book recommendation to go with this section? I‚Äôve got one you‚Äôre not going to hear anywhere else. Go buy the sci-fi book Dune and read it in the context of personal development.
Also, two behavior design notes:
I‚Äôm absolutely positioning the Kindle to be a replacement habit for Facebook and Twitter. How much smarter would you be if you replaced half of your social media usage with reading?
Second, I have a not-very-well supported theory that‚Äôs paired with the book Thinking, Fast and Slow. The behavior design implication of that book is that you need to speak to two systems of the brain. Speaking to the rational, Slow System is easy. Just lay out the facts.
Speaking to the emotional Fast System is much harder, namely because it‚Äôs so hard to see or introspect on what‚Äôs going on in there. But if you accept that difficulty (and this is the part of my theory that feels like pop brain science), then you realize that you need to start looking for ways to rewire your emotional core.
Then, having accepted that rewiring your emotions is part of most behavior design, I‚Äôve started to notice things ‚Äî like that most self-improvement advice is not very rational. That‚Äôs by design. A self-improvement book is mostly emotional rewiring. That is exactly why you need to read the entire book rather than cheating with a summarized version.
I‚Äôve tried and like Firefox Focus and Google Chrome, but there‚Äôs a problem. Either you‚Äôll end up cutting and pasting URLs that auto-opened in Safari or you‚Äôll end up having to manage individual app‚Äôs preferences about how to handle a URL click.
Skip those complications. Safari is good.
There‚Äôs a secret, super rad option in Safari called Reader mode. This mode strips out all of the in-article ads, clutter and junk. I find that it does a great job and saves me from fat-fingering ads that have been placed inside the body of the article.
Here‚Äôs the before and after on an article in Reader mode.
To turn on reader mode once, there‚Äôs a little four line icon at the top left of Safari. I‚Äôd managed to find that on my own.
What I hadn‚Äôt realized was that if you long press on that icon, you‚Äôll get an option to turn on Reader mode permanently for that site. This is amazing and completely changed my experience of reading articles on my phone.
There are two things that you‚Äôre setting up here.
One is that you‚Äôll flat out save time by not seeing or accidentally tapping any ads. That‚Äôs a small productivity gain each day.
The second is related to being in charge of your phone. You don‚Äôt want to see ads because you don‚Äôt want your phone telling you what to buy and when. Advertising on your phone breaks the tool-not-boss rule.
You‚Äôve hidden all of your shallow social media experiences in a folder on your second screen. Now, build a replacement habit for those dead times in your day when you would be tempted to be on Twitter or Facebook.
Pick the media that actually makes you smarter and then put apps for that on your home screen.
My apps are Medium, Kindle and Podcast. Maybe you include the Washington Post (although that‚Äôs probably an anxiety producer that doesn‚Äôt actually need to be checked all day).
These are your deep learning apps and you just need to make sure they are easier to find than your old, shallow, addictive apps.
Replacement habits are a very common strategy in behavior design. The underlying brain science is that it‚Äôs easier to create a new habit than to delete an old habit.
In fact, you don‚Äôt ever really delete old habits. You might stop using the neural pathway for your old habit, but the neurons are still there, waiting for a moment of weakness. Eventually those cells will die out. But there isn‚Äôt actually a way for you to train them to death.
That‚Äôs why we use replacement habits so often. You can train a new, strong habit that supersedes your old habit. In this article, we‚Äôve come at social media usage in a bunch of ways, all of which work together. We‚Äôve tried to short circuit your existing habits by moving the apps, we‚Äôve added accountability through Screen Time, and in this section, we‚Äôve finally introduced the replacement habit that you‚Äôll do instead.
Skip this step if you already have a way you track steps. Lots of you have Fitbits or other ways to do this.
If you aren‚Äôt already using a pedometer, your iPhone will automatically track steps for you in the Health App. However, you don‚Äôt want to have to open that app in order to see your step count.
So, you‚Äôre going to need to install an app that comes with a Today screen widget. My recommendation is Pedometer++.
You‚Äôre building up reasons now to check your Today screen daily. That‚Äôs good.
Also, I went looking for some research to include here on the benefits of 10,000 steps. Unsurprisingly, the pleasing roundness of that number owes more to marketing than to any particular science (9,901 steps is practically just as good).
There is quality research on the health benefits of even tiny amounts of walking (much less than 10,000 steps): trading two minutes of sitting per hour for two minutes of walking per hour reduced mortality by 33%.
That‚Äôs not a justification for doing a full more-is-better 10,000 steps though. The science for doing more walking is mixed, and requires piecing together your own projections. For instance, this 2004 Arizona State paper classifies people who walk 10,000 steps as active and people who walk 12,500 as highly active. But they leave it up to you to cross reference other studies on the health benefits of being in either activity category.
So, my recommendation is to wait on the science and trust your gut instead. For most people, walking feels good. It‚Äôs a chance to use your body, to build up pride in a consistent amount of activity, to listen to podcasts, to see your town or city. Those should be reason enough.
You‚Äôve heard losing weight is calories in, calories out (CICO). And then you might have also heard this is wrong or at least misguided.
The official position in the Better Humans publication is that CICO is just the wrong framing. Rather, instead, you need to think: to lose weight, I need to burn fat.
Our position is that weight loss is all about putting your body into fat-burning situations.
Calorie restriction, it turns out, is not guaranteed to lead to a fat-burning situation. It can instead lead to a lower metabolism.
What does lead to fat loss then? Low carb diets and fasting. And the most common form of fasting is time-restricted eating, where you fit all your eating into an 8 hour window and then fast for the next 16 hours. People refer to this as 16:8.
Additionally, my experience watching people diet (I ran a 15,000 person diet study and have had more than 100,000 dieters come through Coach.me), is that time restricted eating is an easier behavior change. Basically, it‚Äôs easier to train your body to skip breakfast than it is to give up carbs, not for a month, but for the rest of your actual life.
Of course, you can combine both approaches. But if you had to pick one, I‚Äôd start with time restricted eating.
If you absolutely want to go Low Carb, download MyFitnessPal and upgrade ($49.99/year) so that you can track macros. You want to keep your carbs below about 50g. If you don‚Äôt pay for the upgrade, you‚Äôll only be able to see calories and I‚Äôm telling you that‚Äôs not effective.
But really, where I want you to start is just to skip all of that food restriction stuff and start with time restricted eating. As an example, I try to stop eating before 8pm and then don‚Äôt start again until noon the next day.
To track all of this, use an app called Zero and put it on your home screen.
The best explanation why fasting leads to burning fat and why simple calorie restriction leads to lower metabolism comes from Dr. Jason Fung.
Consider that your body has two primary sources for fuel. One is glycogen, i.e. the carbs you eat. And the other is stored fat. Your body uses insulin to switch from one source to the other.
Specifically, when you are in a fed state, i.e. you ate recently, your body releases insulin, which inhibits your body from burning fat. Dr. Fung‚Äôs uses a train track visualization below and I always try to keep in mind which track I‚Äôm intending to be on.
Night shift ‚Äúshifts‚Äù the colors of your display away from the blue spectrum and toward the warmer (redder) spectrum. That‚Äôs supposed to help you sleep better.
The standard advice seems to be to avoid screen time and blue light starting two hours before your bed time.
However, my experience with sleep coaching is that people are often going to bed much later than they should, often because of a phone addiction. Starting Night Shift four hours earlier gives you an opportunity to both go to sleep more easily and also to shift your bed time up. If you find yourself going to bed earlier, then just get up earlier. Congratulations, you‚Äôve become a morning person.
The case against screens is strong. Here a quote from one study:
All bad.
The science for the red shift as a solution to all of the above negative effects is much more iffy. In fact, Night Shift is a pretty silly feature. The studies say blue light is bad. But at the time the Night Shift feature was built, nobody had done proper testing of red light. It turns out red light is also bad.
So, the reason I like this feature is because it‚Äôs a prompt to start working on your evening routine to head to bed. Basically, it‚Äôs just a color coded reminder. That‚Äôs it.
The Medical ID feature makes key medical information available to strangers when your phone is locked.
If you are incapacitated during a medical emergency, a stranger can go to your power-off screen (long press right button and volume up on modern iPhones). That‚Äôs where your Medical ID info will be.
I see Medical ID as having three practical benefits to you, in order of likelihood.
Product designers consistently choose female voices for services like Siri and Alexa because culturally we‚Äôre more comfortable with bossing around women.
Put aside that that‚Äôs gross for one second.
You‚Äôre a productivity nut. You‚Äôre going places. Don‚Äôt you think at some point you‚Äôre going to have to get comfortable bossing around men?
This is going to get weird and darkly introspective.
Originally, I‚Äôd looked into changing Siri‚Äôs voice because somebody had told me that men are more likely to be cruel to a female-voiced AI. You know what I mean about getting frustrated when Siri or Alexa makes a mistake. Alexa, especially, likes to butt in and is just begging to be told to shut up. I‚Äôm constantly having to tell Alexa, ‚ÄúAlexa, stop.‚Äù but how close am I to cracking and yelling ‚ÄúShut up, bitch?‚Äù
I don‚Äôt treat any woman in my life that way and I don‚Äôt want to start with a robot.
I couldn‚Äôt find any research at all to back up this idea of gendered cruelty to robots, although I did find published anecdotes:
Not finding more established research, I backtracked to to the person who‚Äôd originally told me this. Her sources were multiple backchannel discussions from people who work on these AI products. People, not just men, say the rudest, cruelest things to female AIs, much ruder and cruder than they do to male AIs. If I can get one of these AI product people on the record, I‚Äôll add it to this post.
Our relationships to robots is so weird and interesting and scary ‚Äî there‚Äôs deep cultural conditioning, new robot etiquettes, power dynamics, etc.
At heart, I‚Äôm worried about developing patterns with my female AIs that I don‚Äôt have with my female friends, peers and colleagues. And what if those AI patterns transfer over to my human interactions?
You might think the opposite, why can‚Äôt I practice treating my female AIs with respect and grace? I don‚Äôt have a good answer. I just know that this dynamic is worth examining in yourself.
Was this too weird of a tangent? This is honestly the type of shit I think about all day.
The default is something like, ‚ÄúTony Stubblebine‚Äôs iPhone.‚Äù That exposes your privacy when you have your hotspot turned on, and advertises to the entire world that you don‚Äôt know how to customize your phone.
There are three strategies for choosing a new name:
Here‚Äôs how to set this yourself:
Positive self-talk is actually surprisingly effective. I always thought it was too woo-woo, but then I tested it out with some people at work. They all said it was more effective than anything we‚Äôd ever done, including journaling, meditation, sleep, priority setting, and morning routines. People have a lot of negative self-talk that they don‚Äôt like, but which they haven‚Äôt taken the time to train theirselves out of.
If you‚Äôre interested in positive self-talk, I got my start with this By the Book episode, where they read and tested a book about changing your self-talk.
Of course, training yourself to be more positive isn‚Äôt as simple as changing the name of your phone, but it‚Äôs a start.
If you turn off advertising tracking, then the ads you see won‚Äôt be specifically targeted to you and what advertisers know about you. The point here is that getting less targeted ads is good. You want to spend money on your own terms.
This is a variant on ‚Äúyour phone is a tool, not your boss‚Äù. When you want to spend money, you want to use your phone for research and then make a purchase based on that research. You do not want the other way around, where your phone is telling you or brainwashing you what to buy. You are the boss.
You‚Äôre still going to get advertising in some places, but almost all of the advice I‚Äôve given here includes paying for the ad-free version of the apps you use.
Paying for ad-free apps probably saves you money, as you‚Äôre less likely to buy something you don‚Äôt want.
When you stop using your phone, it‚Äôll auto-lock to prevent some stranger from grabbing your phone and digging through your private info. That‚Äôs basically a good feature, but most often the result is that you end up locking yourself out.
Most people keep their cell phones on their person ‚Äî so keeping your phone locked is not a huge security risk. We‚Äôre only talking about five minutes ‚Äî that‚Äôs the maximum auto-lock setting. If you check your phone on the way into your gym, walk to your locker, put your phone in your locker, change into your workout clothes, lock your locker and walk away, your phone has probably already locked itself. (Plus, most of you actually take your phone out to the gym with you!)
So the strategy here is to save yourself the few seconds it takes to unlock your phone by extending the auto-lock time.
My take on the value of saving time here is that those few seconds of waiting for a phone to wake up is when you are at risk for getting distracted. So, worst case this setting saves you a few minutes of time (research says you check your phone 25 times per day). But best case, it saves you from 30 minutes of goofing off.
Sometimes you need to share your hotspot password with a close friend or loved one. A three word phrase is something you can say out loud that they won‚Äôt have trouble spelling.
This is also a more general trick for creating quality passwords that are easy for you to say or remember. Think about your router‚Äôs password for example and how you‚Äôre always having to share it with guests. Sharing a three-word phrase is so much easier than a string of random letters and numbers.
The debate about the security of this strategy for passwords ranges from very positive to just slightly positive.
I spent a summer driving all over the United States, totaling 9,000 miles while working from a campervan. I know a thing or two about internet access from weird spots. In almost all places, using my phone as a hotspot beat out trying to find local wifi. My phone was faster and more convenient. This setting is about making your hotspot even easier to use, especially when you are connecting new devices to it or sharing it with traveling companions. That can actually be a real productivity win.
Swipe down from the top-right of your screen and you‚Äôll have access your Control Center which contains toggles for wifi, bluetooth, flashlight and more.
Apple wants to give you the option to turn this behavior off when you‚Äôre inside of a different app. That‚Äôs a mistake.
The main reason to have always-on access to the control center is so that you can toggle wifi on and off. Direct, manual toggling of the source of your internet is an important way to control the speed of your app experiences.
There have been dozens of times where I‚Äôve wondered why an app was slow and then realized the culprit was either the wifi or the cell signal. As someone who travels a lot, I often find that I get the best internet speeds when I‚Äôm willing to take direct control of switching between wifi and cell service. Sometimes one of those is much stronger than the other.
When you are using your phone as a tool, then fast internet is a direct link to productivity. That‚Äôs the main reason to have access to the Control Center.
This setting used to clog up your bandwidth and kill your phone battery. But we‚Äôre in a new era of fast bandwidth and better batteries. So turn it on.
The upside is that you‚Äôll have one less thing to manage, and all of your apps will stay updated automatically.
No special discussion here other than referencing saving your cognitive budget. When automation works well, you‚Äôre saving your brain cycles to do something better. That‚Äôs the case here.
GarageBand was 1.8GB when I went to check my installed apps. On a new phone, I‚Äôm not planning to do a lot of managing my storage, but 1.8GB is enough to get my attention.
Don‚Äôt worry, you can always reinstall these apps.
This is the sort of thing that‚Äôs better to do now, while your focused attention is on setting up your iPhone. You‚Äôre saving yourself time down the road when you run out of storage at an inopportune time.
Some people take right away to talking to Siri, and other people don‚Äôt.
The problem is the mental version of muscle memory. If you‚Äôve never talked to Siri, then it‚Äôs hard to muster the new behavior in those occasional times where it would be useful.
Here‚Äôs what I suggest: go through the script below a few times and see if anything sticks. You can turn on Siri by long pressing the button on the right of your iPhone. In parentheses, I‚Äôve listed the phrase that will reverse the alarm or reminder that you just set.
Now do something to make calling people easier. Set a nickname for a loved one, like your mom.
What we just did here is a tactic called deliberate practice. When most people read about an iPhone trick, they will try to store the trick away in their memory, hoping that they will remember that trick down the road.
I want you to consider a much more effective approach. If you ever think you want to use a new trick or behavior later on, try practicing it first. The practice makes later recall so much more likely.
This is really a life philosophy to build in practice time for all of your life and work skills. For a very deep dive, see Jason Shen‚Äôs Complete Guide to Deliberate Practice. This is the same article I recommended in the Meditation step.
There are basically two keyboard shortcuts that everyone should have. One is for your email address and the other is for your home address.
Once you get used to the power of shortcuts, you‚Äôll probably start adding more.
Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement
Now when you type either of those shortcuts, you‚Äôll get an option to autocomplete to your full text replacement.
This is a pure and simple productivity hack. No discussion necessary.
There are at least (at least) five places where your phone will pull your home address.
If you went through the Google Maps section, then you added a home address there.
If you went through the Text Replacement section, then you set a shortcut for your address.
There are still three more places to set:
Boom. Now you‚Äôve saved yourself some typing down the road. That‚Äôs productivity.
Yes, you should have backups even though practically every app you install stores your data in the cloud. But backups do make it much easier to set up a new phone when you upgrade (or lose it).
I strongly suggest iCloud backups ‚Äî they‚Äôre cheap. I‚Äôm on the $10.99/year package for 20GB and creeping toward the next level which is just another $0.99/month for another 30GB.
There should be options there to manage your iCloud storage and which apps get backed up. You should back up most of them given how cheap storage is.
I used to resist paying for backups, but the math on the time savings alone is great. You‚Äôll pay a few tens of dollars to save yourself hours of work when you upgrade your phone. And then you‚Äôll save yourself a huge headache if you actually do lose your phone completely.
Below are the principles that come up over and over again in this article. Where possible, I‚Äôve tried to cite science.
However, many of these principles come through my work at Coach.me. We started as a gamified habit tracker, and through that experience, we helped a few million people form a few tens of millions of new habits. The vast majority of those people were motivated by productivity or health.
And then, also through Coach.me, I ran a brain training group that worked individually with 2,000 people and, separately, started a behavior design coaching certification that‚Äôs produced coaches who‚Äôve worked more than with 20,000 clients.
So, the principles that don‚Äôt have citations are, well, just, like, my opinion, man.
No need to lead with science here ‚Äî this starts as dead simple philosophy. What‚Äôs the point of life? Abdicating your life to be a servant of your phone is a shitty approach.
Moreover, a lot of research points out that your phone is not a very good boss. See Tristan Harris‚Äô How Technology is Hijacking Your Mind or Linda Stone‚Äôs Email Apnea.
There are a handful of exercises in this article that have very small surface-level productivity gains. Does it really matter if you save one second every time you open your phone?
I say yes. In my experience training people to break procrastination or enter flow states, those pauses are prime times for you to get distracted. In those cases, a two second pause can turn into a 30 minute break.
If any programmers are reading this, what is the honest answer to how long it takes to run your automated tests? Is it the literal time that the tests run, or the time of the break you take while the tests are running?
From my piece on Superhuman Cognitive Stamina:
Many people look at this as the Steve Jobs turtleneck story. What did he wear to work every day? A black turtleneck. So while you were spending your cognitive budget getting dressed, he was saving his up for when he got to work.
So, on your phone, you want to look for places to eliminate decisions ,because you‚Äôll use those decisions somewhere else.
This NYT piece is the right primer on the research that says willpower is limited. This other NYT piece is the right primer on Carol Dweck‚Äôs work that points to the opposite conclusion, that self-belief determines if willpower is a limited resource. Science is so frustrating ‚Äî two seemingly opposing views. I believe willpower is limited, but trainable.
When you spend time in the productivity world, you start to realize how much time people spend playing around with productivity systems.
Part of this is that a lot of productivity nuts are pursuing productivity as a hobby ‚Äî essentially, they are role-playing a world where they are more successful. So for them, it‚Äôs fun to constantly tweak systems and try new tools.
However, the other reason people spend so much time changing tools and systems is that rigid tools and systems break. When they break, it‚Äôs almost always easier to just start over from scratch with a new system.
So, where possible, try to use a messy system. Those will tend to be less fragile. In this article, the most common messy systems were backed by a strong search feature.
A strong habit is a case where you can do something automatically and effortlessly. That‚Äôs so valuable. It‚Äôs very rare that a new tool has a feature that‚Äôs more valuable than your old habit.
Many productivity reviews say the opposite. They say you should definitely try the newest and latest thing.
They‚Äôre wrong. If you have a habit based around an old tool, then you should be unapologetic about sticking with that tool.
If any programmers are reading this, a good tool to examine would be your text editor. I alternate between Sublime and Vim. I want to be a Sublime user, but my muscle memory around Vim shortcuts is so good that I still find I‚Äôm much more productive in Vim which was publicly released in 1991 and which I‚Äôve been using since 1996.
I‚Äôm strongly influenced by Cal Newport‚Äôs book, Deep Work and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi‚Äôs book, Flow.
Cal comes from the perspective of deep work often being your most productive and valuable work. Mihaly‚Äôs research was actually just focused on happiness. Deep work is when people report the deepest levels of satisfaction.
Both of them recognize how difficult it is to do deep work or deep learning. Those moments don‚Äôt come by accident, and when they do, they are easily disrupted.
A lot of the advice in this article is meant to make it just a little bit easier for you to focus, to get into flow, and to achieve deep thinking and deep accomplishments. The main strategies are to eliminate interruptions, replace shallow behaviors with deeper ones (reading vs. tweeting), and schedule leisure activities and shallow activities so that they don‚Äôt interfere with your deep work.
By default, your phone is set up to create anxiety. I referenced a study about how mild anxiety leads to increased mortality twice in this article.
You paid too much for your iPhone to let it kill you ‚Äî that‚Äôs an outrageous side effect. So instead, eliminate the anxiety.
I gave a few examples of how your phone can change your diet and activity patterns in order to help you live longer. Use Coach.me, Zero & the Pedometer.

#11. Organize your Apps and Folders alphabetically
This is how I did it. You probably won‚Äôt have a TV folder like I do ‚Äî most of those apps are just ways to watch Warriors basketball games.
#12. Choose GmailYes. I get to Inbox Zero every day, practice ‚ÄúTouch it Once‚Äù where I never read an email more than once, and unsubscribe/mute/filter so that I have as little email in my inbox as possible. I don‚Äôt use any built-in smart filters.

#29. Organize your home screen for deep learning over shallow learningYes.
#30. Track steps this wayI also get steps from a Garmin watch, but I find I‚Äôm more likely to have my phone on me than I am to be wearing my watch. So my phone has the more accurate count.
#31. Prefer Time Restricted Eating Over Calorie CountingYes. Love the Zero app and I generally try not to eat before 12. I also own a KetoMojo blood tester ($60) to measure when I‚Äôm in a fat burning mode.
#32. Schedule Night ShiftYes, mine is set for 8pm.
#33. Set up Medical IDYes, mainly so that I can share my emergency contact. I don‚Äôt actually know my blood type.

How we respond to Facebook today will inform the startups of tomorrow

I deleted my Facebook a few weeks ago, but it started scaring me last March.
A friend and I ran into one of his investors in a cafeÃÅ in San Francisco, and the investor asked if we‚Äôd heard of a Soylent competitor, Ample. He was curious what we thought of it, and of meal replacement companies in general.
I hadn‚Äôt heard of Ample, but I shared my concerns with Soylent, and why I personally would never put my money into one of those companies. My friend, for the most part, agreed.
The conversation ended and we left. I didn‚Äôt think about Ample again, look it up, or talk about it online with anyone. But less than 24 hours later, there were ads for it in my Instagram feed.
It was spooky, to say the least. I was used to getting ads for products whose sites I‚Äôd visited, and for products I‚Äôd mentioned on Facebook, but products that I‚Äôd only talked about? That was weird.
After a bit of digging, I discovered I wasn‚Äôt alone. There were dozens of stories online about people getting freaked out by ads that seem like they only could have come from Facebook eavesdropping on their conversations.
Now to be clear, this probably isn‚Äôt happening. It would be a massive amount of work and data processing for marginally better ad targeting. Like the Wired article says, Facebook doesn‚Äôt need to listen to your conversations.
They can target you well enough without it.
That‚Äôs meant to be reassuring: they‚Äôre not listening to you because they don‚Äôt have to. But if anything, that should be even scarier. Facebook knows so much about you they can make you believe they‚Äôre listening to your personal conversations. They have so much data about you they can send you ads that have an uncanny relevance to what is going on in the real world.
Imagine, for a moment, that you had a friend with this level of knowledge about you. Someone who knows everywhere you go, what you like, what you fear, what you want, who you hang out with, how happy you are at any given moment.
They could be an amazing boon to your life. Or they could be a nightmare. It all depends on what they do with the information, and how well you can trust them with it.
Now imagine the friend can use their information about you to make money, say by manipulating your decisions to benefit them. And imagine they‚Äôre the kind of morally bankrupt person who would take advantage of their friend this way.
What would their incentives look like?
Since they can make money by manipulating your decisions, they‚Äôll try to manipulate your decisions. And since they can better manipulate your decisions by learning more about you, the more they‚Äôll want to learn. If they want the greatest success for themselves, they will necessarily have to manipulate you as much as possible and collect as much data on you as possible.
This seems to be the situation Facebook has gotten itself into:
Facebook‚Äôs product is not the platform, it‚Äôs us. If the product is what a business sells to make money, then Facebook‚Äôs product is our attention and data. We are the product. And Facebook‚Äôs customers are the companies buying ads based on that attention and data.
If our time and our attention are Facebook‚Äôs true product, then their long-term goal becomes clear: to influence (and tax) how we communicate in the 21st century. Every product they‚Äôve launched and company they‚Äôve acquired is related to this goal in some way:
Facebook wants to own how we communicate because it means more data and more attention, which means more ads revenue. Simple enough.
But that idea should be a little frightening: a company wants to control how you interact with other humans so that they can make money off of you. This isn‚Äôt some secret, evil motivation driving the company behind closed doors. It‚Äôs a necessary consequence of the incentives that shape it.
Compare this model to Netflix. You pay Netflix a flat monthly fee, and in return, you get unlimited streaming movies and TV shows from their platform. Netflix doesn‚Äôt make more money the more time you spend on it (they make less, actually), so they have no incentive to addict you to the platform (beyond keeping you from switching to a competitor). With Netflix, we‚Äôre the customers.
This isn‚Äôt to say that all free, ad-financed apps are bad and all pay-to-play apps are good. I‚Äôve used Foursquare and Swarm consistently for 7+ years. These are apps where I volunteer my location, travel, eating, and shopping habits, and I‚Äôve never had the slightest sense that Foursquare was using this data in a way that made my life worse.
The ads in Foursquare tend to be useful. Their goal for the product is to be the place consumers go to find the next restaurant or cafeÃÅ to try. They don‚Äôt need you to spend tons of time in the app, and they don‚Äôt need you to buy products from vendors unrelated to your in-app goals. They just want you to stay in the habit of checking in places and finding places through them, so they serve you ads related to the kinds of foods and stores you tend to like.
If Foursquare started using that data in a way that made me uncomfortable, I‚Äôd stop using it. If every time I checked into a restaurant I started getting emails from them afterwards, I‚Äôd know Foursquare was selling my email address to places I checked in and I wouldn‚Äôt be cool with that. I‚Äôd delete it, and switch to an app I had more trust in.
The problem with Facebook is that its managed to gain such a monopoly on our digital presence that we worry about quitting it. Switching from Foursquare to Yelp doesn‚Äôt give anyone anxiety, but deleting Facebook does.
How did Facebook get so ingrained in our lives that people who lived without it for thirty years are suddenly concerned about losing it?
Partially for the same reason people joined in the first place: information. We want to know what‚Äôs going on in the lives of our friends and acquaintances, and Facebook has become the go-to source for doing that.
But in the process, Facebook has changed friendship from an active to a passive process. You can sit back and wait for some update to appear from a friend or acquaintance and then respond to it. You don‚Äôt have to put in any effort to reach out and ask what‚Äôs going on, you get it fed to your by the magical friend algorithms.
How often do you reach out to your friends to ask them how it‚Äôs going? Or to see if there are any big updates in their lives? There‚Äôs hardly any need anymore, since Facebook has automated the process. We don‚Äôt have to put in the work, the information comes to us, and so we‚Äôve lost the muscles we used to use for staying updated on our social circle.
It‚Äôs similar to the problem I outlined in my article on the switch from search to social. As we moved away from actively looking for things on the Internet, having them fed to us instead, we became more passive informational consumers. And as we move more towards passive Facebook-style friendships, we lose our old abilities to stay in touch with people.
This would be fine if Facebook relationships were as meaningful as in-person ones, but they aren‚Äôt. Conversations through chat apps and getting up to date on your friends through the newsfeed is the relationship equivalent of Soylent. A technological pseudo-improvement over an ancient human process, and one that falls dramatically short of the value it‚Äôs trying to recreate.
And since we‚Äôve been sipping the Facebook friend juice for so long, it‚Äôs legitimately scary to quit. How will you know what events are going on? How will you know if something big happens in your friend‚Äôs life? How will you stay in touch with people?
The simple answer is... all the ways we did for the last 100,000 years. Talking to people. Being an active consumer of information and knowledge about your friends‚Äô lives instead of letting it passively wash over you.
But it would still be fair to ask: why bother. Yes, quitting Facebook does make it more likely that you‚Äôll miss events, updates, and messages, since other people are on it. And yes, it can be a little inconvenient to not have it at times, depending on your friend group.
So why is it worth it to delete the social network instead of begrudgingly continuing to use it?
Someone observing the digital landscape a couple years from now could see Facebook continuing its dominance and deduce that it‚Äôs fine to play fast and loose with customer data in the name of growth, to optimize your product around addictiveness, and to sell information on your users.
Or, in a couple years, they could see the massive consequences Facebook faced for behaving that way. They could see people chose to give their attention to products they trust, and left Facebook in droves.
Which is why quitting Facebook matters: it sends the message that companies can‚Äôt, and shouldn‚Äôt, try to have that much power over our lives. That if other companies try in the future, they‚Äôll get punished for it.
If someone in our social circle deceives us or lies to us, we tell our friends. We use gossip to spread information about who is and isn‚Äôt trustworthy, partially so there are consequences for not being trustworthy. If businesses aren‚Äôt subject to the same consequences for not being trustworthy, they‚Äôll have no motivation to think before they do something that could break their users‚Äô trust.
If Facebook thinks they can keep focusing on addiction, ad revenue, and data collection with no consequences, they‚Äôll keep doing it.
Reflecting on how Facebook has become such a dominant force in our lives the last five to ten years, and the consequences of that dominance, I think there are a few key lessons from it that we can apply to other technologies:
Facebook can‚Äôt replace socialization and face-to-face communication. Soylent can‚Äôt replace food. Porn can‚Äôt replace sex. Tinder can‚Äôt replace dating. It‚Äôs tempting to try to technologize everything in our lives, but it won‚Äôt work for these more old-school processes, and we should stop believing that four guys in their Harvard dorm room can really make a better social network than the one we have IRL.
Opt for services you pay for instead of services that sell your information. Pay to remove ads whenever possible. When you‚Äôre using a product for free, you‚Äôre still paying for it in some way, typically through the data and attention you‚Äôre giving it. Watch out for the incentives of companies and products you use, and don‚Äôt expect that they‚Äôll all be benevolent masters of your information.
If a company can‚Äôt be trusted, ditch them, and let them feel the consequences. If a product can get away with mistreating its users to make money, it will keep doing it until they feel the consequences.
Facebook has become the abusive partner in many people‚Äôs lives. They‚Äôve carved out such a seemingly important role in your life that even though you want to leave, you‚Äôre scared of the consequences.
But I can‚Äôt stress enough how little impact quitting has on your life. I was almost entirely off it for a year before deleting it, and in that time I‚Äôve never missed it. Have I missed an event or two? Probably, but that‚Äôs a small price to pay.
And as for staying up to date on my friends lives... well I just do it the old fashioned way. Talking to them. Which is wonderful since we actually have something to talk about when we meet in person, instead of sitting on our phones looking at Facebook to get up to date on all our other friends‚Äô lives.
Imagine going back 10 years and being told that if you signed up for Facebook, they were going to collect a disturbing amount of information on you, manipulate your emotions, store your conversations, and try to control how you communicate with people online. Would you sign up? Would you let your kid sign up?
I wouldn‚Äôt, and I don‚Äôt think you would either.

You will discover why you‚Äôve never heard of the latter here shortly.
As you probably read somewhere inside that history textbook you were forced to lug around through elementary ‚Äî The Wright Brothers were responsible for creating the first successful airplane. You remember how the story goes...
While today ‚ÄúThe Wright Brothers‚Äù is the first name that comes to anyone‚Äôs mind when they hear the word fly, once upon a time the pair were major underdogs.
In fact, during the race to the sky, most of America had its money on the man I mentioned earlier, Langley.
He was an extremely outspoken astronomer, physicist and aviation pioneer who was on a mission to make history. Langley‚Äôs high stature as the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution gave him both the credibility and hype he needed to get America on his side.
Not to mention, he was extremely well-backed by the War Department who contributed $50,000 to help him be the first to get a bird in the sky.
Long story short, despite all the hype, Langley‚Äôs flying machine ended up crashing and burning while The Wright Brother‚Äôs plane ended up soaring.
One party had the entire world, vast resources and plenty of moolah on his side, while the other just had a small bike shop and a passion to fly.
So, let me ask you this... can you guess why The Wright Brothers achieved their goal to take flight while Langley failed?
The Wright Brothers victory over Langley came down to passion, intrinsic motivation (Langley was very status driven) and perhaps praise.
While Langley was sharing his ambitions with the world and being heavily praised for feats he had not yet achieved, The Wright Brothers were receiving little to no attention whatsoever.
Some experts argue that early praise can leave the individual receiving the praise feeling like he or she has already won... in turn causing them to be less likely to follow through with their goals.
For example, in Peter Gollwitzer‚Äôs research article, When Intentions Go Public, he raises this very question:
Gollwitzer and his team of researchers carried out a handful of studies, here is a brief excerpt from their findings:
‚ÄúOther people‚Äôs taking notice of one‚Äôs identity-relevant intentions apparently engenders a premature sense of completeness regarding the identity goal.‚Äù
In English, what Gollwitzer found was that when individuals set a goal that is closely tied to their identity and then share their intentions with others, they are less likely to achieve the goal.
For example, if your goal is to start drinking more water and you tell your friends and family that you‚Äôre going to start drinking more water, this would probably have little to no impact on whether or not you actually drink more water.
Why? Because drinking more water isn‚Äôt something you hold close to your identity.
On the other hand, if your goal is to lose 40 lbs and drop 2‚Äì3 waist sizes, it might not be the best idea to post about it all over Facebook. Your appearance is something you very much so identify with. So, if you tell people you plan to lose weight and everyone tells you how awesome you are and how great you‚Äôre going to look, you might be less likely to lose the weight.
This finding is a bit counterintuitive, considering we were told by our teachers and coaches growing up to set our goals, share our goals, hold ourselves accountable.
But, the theory certainly holds some weight (pun very much intended), and is one that has been adopted by highly successful serial entrepreneurs like Derek Sivers, founder of CD Baby.
Sivers gave a TED Talk on this very topic nearly a decade back. To prove his point, he asked the audience to imagine how they felt when they shared their goals with others:
Sivers goes on to explain that it‚Äôs this ‚Äúwarm feeling‚Äù that keeps us from battling on to actually achieve our goals.
When we openly share our goals, we experience a feeling of success that normally only takes place upon completion of the goal.
The result? We don‚Äôt ever actually pursue the goal.
I‚Äôve recently shared 3 real-life business tactics to achieve your ‚Äúbig hairy goals‚Äù. But now, let‚Äôs talk about what can actually work when it comes to successfully reaching your goals.
For two counterintuitive yet effective approaches to this, we look to a philosophy called ‚Äúfear-setting‚Äù and making an effort to surround yourself with competition.
Entrepreneur, angel investor and writer, Tim Ferriss, gave an incredible TED Talk where he discussed how fear-setting is instrumental in achieving one‚Äôs goals.
He recommends that instead of obsessively sharing your goals, you should come to terms with all the fears that are preventing you from achieving them.
For example, let‚Äôs say your goal is to start your own business. Ferriss recommends that you write down all of your fears that are associated with starting a business.
These might include... ‚ÄúLosing all my money‚Äù... ‚ÄúGetting fired from my day job‚Äù... ‚ÄúGetting laughed at or judged if I fail‚Äù.
Once you write down these fears, you should then write down how you would go about preventing these fears (or mitigating the likelihood) of them actually happening.
For example, for the first fear ‚Äúlosing all my money‚Äù, your prevention might be... ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only going to invest $2,500 that way I can‚Äôt lose it all.‚Äù
Finally, after you have written down your preventions, you should then write down how you will repair what you fear from happening... if it actually ends up happening.
So, to repair losing the $2,500, you might write down, ‚ÄúGet a part time job as a bartender in addition to my day job until I make the $2,500 back.‚Äù
By concentrating on fear-setting over goal-sharing, it allows you to remove the fear that is keeping you from actually achieving your goals.
In addition to fear-setting, it might also be a good idea to surround yourself with competition.
A healthy dose of competition can be good for your business, too. At JotForm, we love to use competition to our advantage with events like hackweeks to achieve our product release goals.
A study published two years ago in the journal Preventive Medicine Reports, sheds some light on the impact that competition has on our goals.
The study put 800 undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania through an 11-week exercise program where each person was assigned to work out alone or in a team.
In addition, the teams were designed to be either supportive or competitive.
By the end of the study, researchers found that students involved in the competitive team programs were 90% more likely to attend their scheduled exercise sessions than any other group.
Not only is this number staggering, but it also proves that competition can create a higher level of commitment among people chasing down goals.
When you surround yourself with competition, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to share your goals with the competition. You don‚Äôt have to tell the other folks in the spin class, cross-fit training or pick-up basketball leagues that your goal is to lose 50 lbs.
But, by simply showing up and placing yourself in a competitive environment, you will be more likely to push harder and show up more often ‚Äî two factors that can help your reach your goals.
The science behind achieving goals has always been an interesting topic.
While some entrepreneurs advocate the idea that you should never have a goal, I‚Äôve recently explained why setting big goals can make you miserable.
Whether you decide to share your goals or not, what I‚Äôve found out across 12 years of entrepreneurship is that you should craft your own path.
What works for others won‚Äôt always work for you. And what works for you today won‚Äôt always work tomorrow.

Ryan Holiday|37K|10|https://medium.com/the-mission/if-you-only-read-a-few-books-in-2018-read-these-89d03fc149c6?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|If You Only Read A Few Books In 2018, Read These ‚Äì The Mission ‚Äì Medium|"If you‚Äôd liked to be jerked around less, provoked less, and more productive and inwardly focused, where should you start?
To me, the answer is obvious: by turning to wisdom. Below is a list of 21 books that will help lead you to a better, stronger 2018.
Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport Media consumption went way up in 2017. For most of us, that meant happiness and productivity went way down. The world is becoming noisier and will become more so every day. If you can‚Äôt cultivate the ability to have quiet, insightful, deeply focused periods of productive work, you‚Äôre going to get screwed. This is a book that explains how to cultivate and protect that skill ‚Äî the ability to do deep work. I strongly urge you to begin this practice in 2018‚Äî if you want to get anything done or perform your best.
The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life by Mark Manson To me, practical philosophy has always been the art knowing what to ‚Äî and what not to ‚Äî give a fuck about. That‚Äôs what Mark‚Äôs book is about. It‚Äôs not about apathy. It‚Äôs about cultivating indifference to things that don‚Äôt matter. Be careful, as Marcus Aurelius warns, not to give the little things more time and thought they deserved. Maybe looking back at this year reveals how much effort you‚Äôve frittered away worrying about the trivial. If so, let 2018 be a year that you only devote energy to things that truly matter ‚Äî get the important things right by ignoring the insignificant.
The Way to Love: The Last Meditations of Anthony de Mello by Anthony de Mello Coach Shaka Smart recommended this little book (and it‚Äôs a little book, probably the smallest I‚Äôve ever read. It fits in your palm). But it‚Äôs an incredibly wise and helpful read. Written by a Catholic Priest who‚Äôd lived in India, the book has this unusual convergence of eastern and western thought. One of my favorite lines: ‚ÄúThe question to ask is not ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs wrong with this person?‚Äô but ‚ÄòWhat does this irritation tell me about myself?‚Äô I plan on regularly revisiting it throughout 2018.
But What If We‚Äôre Wrong by Chuck Klosterman It‚Äôs always good to remind ourselves that almost everything we‚Äôre certain about will probably be eventually proven wrong. Klosterman‚Äôs subtitle ‚Äî Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past ‚Äî is a brilliant exercise for getting some perspective in 2018. Whether you think it‚Äôs going to be a year of radical change for the better or a horrible year of excesses of dangerous precedent, you‚Äôre probably wrong. You‚Äôre probably not even in the ballpark. This book shows you why, not with lectures about politics, but with a bunch of awesome thought experiments about music, books, movies and science.
Rules for Radicals: A Practical Primer for Realistic Radicals by Saul Alinsky If Hillary Clinton had remembered the lessons of Saul Alinsky (who she wrote her college thesis on), the election may have turned out differently. Why? A notorious strategist and community organizer, Alinsky was a die hard pragmatist, but he also knew how to tell a story and create a collective cause. He could work within the system but knew how to shake it up and generate attention. This book is a classic and woefully underrated. Whatever you set out to do in 2018, this book can provide you with strategic guidance and insight.
The Filter Bubble by Eli Pariser / Trust Me I‚Äôm Lying by Ryan Holiday / The Brass Check by Upton Sinclair I strongly recommend that you take the time in 2018 to read these books. In light of this year, you owe it to yourself to study and better understand how our media system works. In The Filter Bubble, Eli Pariser warns of the danger of living in bubbles of personalization that reinforce and insulate our worldview. Though Sinclair‚Äôs The Brass Check has been almost entirely forgotten by history, it‚Äôs not only fascinating but a timeless perspective. Sinclair deeply understood the economic incentives of early 20th century journalism and thus could predict and analyze the manipulative effect it had on The Truth. I used that book as a model for my expose of the media system, Trust Me, I‚Äôm Lying. Today, the incentives and pressures are different but they warp our information in a similar way. In almost every substantial charge Upton leveled against the yellow press, you could, today, sub in blogs and the cable news cycle and be even more correct.
48 Laws of Power / 33 Strategies of War by Robert Greene Robert Greene is a master of human psychology and human dynamics ‚Äî he has a profound ability to explain timeless truths through story and example. You can read the classics and not always understand the lessons. But if you read Robert‚Äôs books, I promise you will leave not just with actionable lessons but an indelible sense of what to do in many trying and confusing situations. I wrote earlier this year that strategic wisdom is not something we are born with ‚Äî but the lessons are there for us to pick up. Pick these two up before the year ends and operate the next with a strategic mindset and clarity.
Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue by Ryan Holiday ‚Äî If you want to immerse yourself in the above topics of media and strategy, and are looking for one book to teach you lessons in both, my book on the nearly decade-long conspiracy that billionaire Peter Thiel waged against Gawker will do this for you. This is a stunning story about how power works in the modern age, and is a masterclass in strategy and how to accomplish wildly ambitious aims.
The Road To Character by David Brooks When General Stanley McChrystal was asked on the Tim Ferriss podcastwhat was a recent purchase that had most positively impacted his life, he pointed to this book. I agree. It can be a bit stilted and dense at times, but it should be assigned reading to any young person today (a little challenge is a good thing). Illustrating with examples and stories from great men and women, Brooks admonishes the reader to undertake their own journey of character perfection. In my own book, I explore the same topic (humility) from a different angle using similar stories ‚Äî I‚Äôm attacking ego, he‚Äôs building up character. Both will be important for the next year.
The Dip by Seth Godin This book is a short 70 pages and it looks like something someone would give as a joke gift, but it‚Äôs anything but. Godin talks frankly about quitting and pushing through ‚Äî and when to do each. Quit when you‚Äôll be mediocre, when the returns aren‚Äôt worth the investment, when you no longer think you‚Äôll enjoy the ends. Stick when the dip is the obstacle that creates scarcity, when you‚Äôre simply bridging the gap between beginner‚Äôs luck and mastery. I promise, next year you are guaranteed to find yourself in moments when you don‚Äôt know what is the right answer. This book will help you find it.
Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis by J. D. Vance / Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right by Arlie Russell Hochschild You might describe Hillbilly Elegy as a Ta-Nehisi Coates style memoir about a community that ‚Äî at least in progressive circles ‚Äî gets a lot less attention: disaffected, impoverished whites (particularly in the mid-east and South). I thought the book was empathetic, self-aware and inspiring. The author pokes some holes in the concept of ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù ‚Äî certainly a third or fourth generation hillbilly in Kentucky doesn‚Äôt walk around feeling like they have it easy ‚Äî and an explanation of some of the phenomenon behind Donald Trump (notice I said explanation, not an excuse). This is a sober but also hopeful book. I urge people on all sides of the political spectrum to read it, but progressives would benefit from the eye-opening perspective the most. Pair it with Strangers in Their Own Land, the author of which, a Berkeley native, visits and interviews people in the deep Louisiana countryside. (Remember: you don‚Äôt have to agree with the people you‚Äôre reading about ‚Äî but you should care what makes them tick.)
It Can‚Äôt Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis This book is one that will make you so uncomfortable that you‚Äôll probably pick it up and put it down several times. It almost shocks you that this exists, that it‚Äôs not some work of fiction pretending to be 80 years old. But no, in fact, one of America‚Äôs most famous writers wrote a bestselling book about an appalling populist demagogue who won the presidency of the United States. Europe was a mess, the economy was in the toilet. Well meaning people talked earnestly about the need for ‚Äúserious change‚Äù and ‚Äúrevolution.‚Äù The parties split, and a fringe candidate suddenly becomes viable. When people tried to question some of the ideas he campaigned on, they were shouted down: ‚ÄúThis is how all politicians speak. He‚Äôs not serious about that extreme stuff.‚Äù Life imitates art and now, this is what actually happened. Change the dates, places and names and it‚Äôs no longer fiction, it‚Äôs real. Fiction is best when it puts a mirror up to us. This book does that. If you don‚Äôt read the book, at least please read about it. Because you need to know. It can happen here.
How to Live: Or A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer by Sarah Bakewell The book is spectacular. It was a bestseller in the UK and was featured in a 6 part series in The Guardian. The format of the book is a bit unusual, instead of chapters it is made up of 20 Montaigne style essays that discuss the man from a variety of different perspectives. Montaigne was a man obsessed with figuring himself out ‚Äî why he thought the way he did, how he could find happiness, his fetishes, his near-death experiences. He lived in tumultuous times too and he coped by looking inward. We‚Äôre lucky he did, and we can do the same.
Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging by Sebastian Junger Junger looks at many of the social issues we have today: PTSD. Depression. Political polarization. Contempt for our fellow citizens. Aimlessness. We‚Äôve lost the bonds that tie a tribe and culture together. No wonder veterans feel alone and lost when they leave their tight knit tribe and re-enter solitary civilian life. No wonder manypeople feel that way regardless of whether they served or not. No wonder we have trouble agreeing on basic solutions to common problems. There is no sense of what is common or basic or shared. Given the divisiveness that we are facing as a society ‚Äî that became painfully clear in 2016 ‚Äî this is one of the most urgent and important book you need to read next year.
The Years of Lyndon Johnson (4 Volumes) by Robert A. Caro In January of 2016, I picked up my first book in this Caro‚Äôs series on Lyndon Johnson. It wasn‚Äôt until June that I finished my fourth, but I consider finishing all (~3,500 pages) of them to be one of my proudest reading achievements. If there is one line that sums up the whole series it‚Äôs this: It‚Äôs that power doesn‚Äôt only corrupt. That‚Äôs too simple. What power does is reveal. It‚Äôs also easy to be disillusioned by politics right now but for me, getting lost in these Lyndon Johnson books has been a helpful and educational process. Because you learn two things 1) that things have always been complicated and confusing but they tend to turn out alright 2) that our system, whatever its flaws, can still produce good results from bad men. And without a doubt, that‚Äôs a good reminder to have on the eve of 2018.
The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill (3 Volumes) by William Manchester Don‚Äôt think an individual can make a difference in history? Then you haven‚Äôt read enough about Winston Churchill. The scenes in this book: warning about the looming threat of Nazism, the retreat at Dunkirk, persevering through the Blitz, vowing to fight on the landing grounds and the beaches and in the streets, whatever the cost may be. The sheer determination of this man, to take an entire country on your back and defy a horde which had overrun the European continent in a matter of months...it‚Äôs almost breathtaking to think about. (If you were to only read one thing in the next year, you could do a lot worse than either of these series. They contain dozens of books within them and will teach you about so much more than just the man they are ostensibly about. Please, please read them.)
Mr. Eternity by Aaron Thier / The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas These books really have nothing to do with the events of 2016 but they are long and entertaining and they will make you forget your problems for the next 12 months. I thought I‚Äôd read Monte Cristo as a kid, but clearly I didn‚Äôt. Because the actual book is a 1,200 page epic of some of the most brilliant, beautiful and complicated storytelling ever put to paper. What a book! When I typed out my notes (and quotes) after finishing this book, it ran some 3,000 words. As for Mr. Eternity, it‚Äôs a fun, epic jaunt through the distant future (as though it was the past) in the vein of Voltaire‚Äôs Candide. Candide isn‚Äôt a bad read for this year either: ‚ÄúWe must cultivate our own garden.‚Äù

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre working on a side hustle or if you‚Äôre a junior developer wanting to get noticed and promoted. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre a lead developer looking for a change of pace, from a corporate gig to a start-up or the other way around. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre jobless out of college.
As long as you‚Äôre a programmer, no skill is more important to your success than focused, deep work.
From Cal Newport‚Äôs book Deep Work:
I‚Äôm going to use some points from Deep Work to tie together my thoughts on becoming a successful, in-demand developer. I highly recommend reading it if you‚Äôre in the technology field in any capacity.
I‚Äôm a self-taught programmer. But I didn‚Äôt start programming until my late 20s. I‚Äôve always considered myself an artistic person and figured I‚Äôd end up in a creative field.
And I did. After college I started a company that did graphics and web design for small, local businesses. I was a pro at Photoshop and knew enough HTML and CSS to be dangerous.
But anything more complicated, requiring even a line of PHP, I had to outsource.
I was petrified of code for a very long time and left it to the folks with Computer Science degrees.
‚ÄúOne wrong keystroke and the client‚Äôs business could go up in flames...‚Äù I thought. I wasn‚Äôt too far off honestly (in the days before version control, there was no turning back with FTP).
Now I‚Äôm a lead developer for a Fortune 50 company working on a product that entertains millions of people every month.
How‚Äôd I get here in a few short years? ü§î
My ‚Äúsecret‚Äù is getting good at focus and deep work. There‚Äôs nothing special about me. I took the time to train myself how to focus on one specific thing, without distraction, for an extended period of time.
Programming is very much a creative pursuit.
It may seem technical and dry to a regular person, but you are a creator. You‚Äôre creating something out of nothing. That ‚Äúnothing‚Äù can be an idea in your head for an app or a feature request from a product manager.
That thing doesn‚Äôt exist yet, but you‚Äôre going to bring it to life. Not with paint or words, but with code (OK, some words, as long as they‚Äôre not reserved words).
If you have any desire to produce at a high level, then you have to practice.
The quantity and quality of your output increases when you get better at being able to stay focused for longer, intentional periods.
Art, music, and writing all require long periods of uninterrupted time where the myelin thickens on those synapses between your brain cells. Programming is no different.
You get better with practice and time. And you can get a lot better, in less time, when you make your practice more effective.
Let me preface this by saying that I hate buzzwords like ‚Äúrockstar‚Äù ‚Äúninja‚Äù and ‚Äú10x developer.‚Äù Every developer does, but companies and recruiters love to use them.
Despite the cheesiness, there is a lot of truth behind the ‚Äú10x Developer‚Äù idea.
It doesn‚Äôt mean that one person can replace ten. It means that some developers get more done, with better quality, and in less time. They do it consistently over the long run without working any harder than anyone else.
This ability is not a natural gift. You aren‚Äôt born with it and it‚Äôs not something you can ‚Äúturn on.‚Äù It‚Äôs a skill that you can, and must, practice and train.
I‚Äôve been on the hiring side dozens of times and I will tell you any company would love to have an entire team of 10x developers. But that‚Äôs not reality.
There are more open developer jobs than there are qualified developers to fill them. Businesses are having trouble filling positions with any qualified developers, let alone (some multiplier)x developers.
It‚Äôs hard to find good talent.
Most companies will knock down the door for a 10x developer but they‚Äôre happy hiring 5x, 2x, and even 1x developers.
A 1x developer (yes, I made this up) is a developer who can do the job they‚Äôre hired to do. Nothing more, nothing less. Seriously. Any company will be delighted with that. Plenty has been written about the astronomical cost of a bad hire.
It‚Äôs time to step up your career. There‚Äôs so much opportunity for you to get hired and thrive in a career you love.
If you‚Äôre the entrepreneurial type, the same lessons apply. More so because your livelihood depends on being effective with your time.
This is how you go from junior to senior developer. This is how you go from 0.5x developer to 5x developer. This is how you get your side project off the ground when you only have a 10 hours a week to work on it.
Hell, this is how you survive.
The first thing to realize is that learning to focus isn‚Äôt easy. You‚Äôre not going to be able to start producing novels of quality code from the start. Especially if you‚Äôve never dealt with the reality of how easily distracted you are.
Learning to focus requires practice. Anything that requires practice means its difficult. If it wasn‚Äôt, you‚Äôd be good at it by default.
You‚Äôre going to struggle and that‚Äôs OK. We‚Äôll start small.
Deep work is not locking yourself in a dark room and forcing yourself to aimlessly navigate code for 14 hours at a time. Just because you‚Äôre doing something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs worth doing.
You need to figure out what‚Äôs important and what‚Äôs not. That‚Äôs beyond the scope of this post. If you‚Äôre going to spend the time learning how to focus, then do it on something that has a high return for the effort involved.
It‚Äôs like the sun and a magnifying glass.
Distracted work is your energy going in every direction like the sun. You can stand outside in the sun and you‚Äôre not going to get hurt.
Learn to concentrate that scattered energy with a magnifying glass and your ability to destroy goes from 0 to 10. We want to preserve that limited power for important things (the sun goes down eventually).
Multitasking is a lie. You‚Äôre fooling yourself if you think you can write quality code while checking Slack messages or reading news in another window.
We live in a world of distraction. The technology we work on is a double-edged sword. There‚Äôs nothing like that sweet, sweet dopamine hit from a new notification.
‚ÄúCool, someone liked that I saw Hamilton.‚Äù But that‚Äôs poison to your ability to focus.
Removing distraction is the foundation of focused, deep work.
Before you have a panic attack thinking that you can‚Äôt go 8 hours without any distractions, don‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôll be using the Pomodoro Technique to break up our day.
There are a lot of productivity techniques out there, but my favorite has been the Pomodoro. I‚Äôm going to paraphrase it below to get you started.
If you want the official rundown, check out The Pomodoro Technique book, which gets more detailed and rule-oriented.
You‚Äôll work for 25 minutes, undistracted, on one thing. That chunk of work is a one ‚ÄúPomodoro.‚Äù
Use a Timer. I‚Äôve used an old school hourglass before. If you want to be a true Pomodoro aficionado, then use a tomato timer.
It is imperative that you walk away when its break time. Grab some water. Browse Hacker News. Go to the bathroom. Whatever it is, work is over. Disconnect from work completely.
This can be fixing a bug, planning out a new feature, or starting a video series to learn a new framework.
If the task is too big (like ‚Äúmake an app‚Äù) then you have to break it down into smaller chunks that take roughly 25 minutes.
Some tasks need several Pomodoros to complete. It might take three Pomodoros to code a feature and two more to write the tests.
Or you might need to batch similar, small tasks into a Pomodoro (ex ‚Äî reply on 5 JIRA tickets).
The point is that the task, or tasks, have to be one ‚Äútype‚Äù of work.
As an aside, the main reason we procrastinate is because we get overwhelmed by huge, insurmountable tasks. If your goal is to ‚ÄúWrite a Book‚Äù you‚Äôll never do it. When you break it out into smaller chunks like ‚ÄúWrite an outline‚Äù or ‚ÄúWrite 300 words‚Äù then the path becomes clearer. Starting is easier, and doable.
While this post has been about becoming a better developer, not procrastination, the truth is that many times they are the same thing.
See Step 1. If you get distracted, the Pomodoro doesn‚Äôt count and you have to start over.
25 minutes might be hard for you if you‚Äôve never done this before. Start with 10 minutes and work your way up from there. Next one would be 15, then 20, then 25.
You can work your way up to 55-minute blocks when you really get good at this.
The first time you try distraction-free work, 25 minutes in a day might be all you can handle. That‚Äôs fine. Keep working your way up by adding a little each day.
Let‚Äôs be real. You‚Äôre not helping your career by jumping from your code editor to a chatroom to an email to a real-life conversation.
You might look and feel busy, and you might even ship some code once in a while.
But the fact is that a few hours of undistracted, deep work produces more quantity and quality than a full day of scattered, distracted work.
Start with one Pomodoro. Eventually you‚Äôll be able to chain a few Pomodoros together.
Then you‚Äôll chain a few days of Pomodoros together.
Then weeks and months.
You‚Äôll find its easier to get into a flow state, and it will happen more often.
This is gold. This is when you have those ‚Äúeureka‚Äù moments and breakthroughs.
This is when the hard thing that‚Äôs been kicking your ass becomes easy.
This is when your coding skills level up exponentially.
The demand for good, qualified programmers is higher than ever. The surest path to success is getting into the ritual of deep, focused work.
Try it out and let me know what you think. If you have other productivity techniques, post them below!
I appreciate all of the love that this article is getting. There‚Äôs no better way to support me than to give me a follow on Medium (Bar Franek). It lets me know that I should write more!
Did you know that you can give up to 50 üëè‚Äôs by pressing down on the üëè button? Give it a try if you reaaaally liked this article!
I wrote a follow-up article here called Going Deeper on Deep Work about what you should apply these techniques to

But here‚Äôs something most people don‚Äôt know about him: He was also a world-class safecracker.
In the 1940s, in the New Mexico Desert, Feynman was bored while working on the Manhattan project that would birth the atomic bomb. Naturally, then, he decided to occupy himself by pulling pranks on his colleagues.
Knowing that most of them were relatively careless when dealing with the safes that stored top secret documents ‚Äî whether forgetting to lock them, or leaving them on factory settings, or choosing obvious dates as their codes ‚Äî he began leaving notes in the place of their work like:
Eventually, he got so good at it that the Colonel in charge of his unit began advising people that if Feynman had been anywhere near their safe, it was a part of their job to change their combination lock once more.
This story is one of many stories Feynman tells in his autobiography Surely, You‚Äôre Joking Mr. Feynman!, where his playful nature gets the better out of both him and his attention.
One of the things I‚Äôve personally always admired about Feynman is that he was so deeply curious about things that the only purpose behind what he decided to commit himself to was what he found interesting.
He had general aims, I‚Äôm sure, and given the complexity of the work he put out, he was obviously an insanely focused person, but the orienting impulse that guided him was beyond goals and simple ambitions. He was far more interested in getting somewhere past the known.
Goals as orientation are common in almost all of our pursuits. We look ahead, predict what may make us happy in the future, and we then narrow down towards something specific. But what if that‚Äôs not the way?
When dealing with the future, an orientation of some sort ‚Äî however vague or specific ‚Äî is necessary. If we didn‚Äôt have one, we would be entirely shaped by the current of luck and randomness, which isn‚Äôt always a blessing.
To exercise some semblance of agency over our lives, then, we often resort to goal-setting. We are taught to do so early on so that we can keep up with the world around us. Later, corporations, for example, even have acronyms, like SMART goals, that have us continuing to do so.
Now, whether we are setting SMART goals or personal ones under our own framework (or no framework), the one thing that they have in common is that they are relatively concrete. You want to be married by 30, earn an executive position by 40, and be retired by 50. That‚Äôs how they usually go.
For the most part, my inclination is to say that having these is better than not having any, and certain people have a genetic disposition to find satisfaction in specific accomplishment more so than others, but there are also problems that come with spending an entire life living goal to goal.
For one, it attempts to predict an unpredictable future. Who is to say that what you want tomorrow or the year after is the same thing you want right now? More critically, what if what you want right now isn‚Äôt even oriented in the right direction over the long-term and you‚Äôre actually going the wrong way? Life changes, we change, and none of this is evident without hindsight.
Secondly, and just as importantly, it creates an anchor: You bind your expectations of happiness and contentment onto something so singular that you often forget that other things in your life are capable of adding just as much joy to your experience than the thing you‚Äôre so fixated on.
Everybody knows that the ultimate reward is the process, not the goal, but what we forget is that the virtue of even having goals makes it very hard to stay honest to a process that often deviates day to day.
This creates a strange tension: On one end, goals of some sort are necessary, and giving the future its due attention is the right thing to do; on the other hand, the act of creating these goals and worshiping them, as we often do, leads to a conflict that we can‚Äôt easily get away from.
To solve this tension, we have to move towards something more nebulous.
The really fascinating, and even admirable, thing about Feynman was that if he ever had a goal, it was simply this: to learn as much as possible in any direction that his innate curiosity took him.
For brief periods of his time, working on one problem or the other, he may have had more specific goals, sure, and he certainly took the time to focus on them as he needed without distractions. But broadly, his orientation was pointed towards the most interesting thing he could find.
The pursuit of interestingness, I think, solves the predicament that is inherent in goal-setting. It‚Äôs vague and nebulous enough to be honest about the unpredictability of the future, without being hopelessly lost in the chaos of pure luck and randomness.
Throughout life, we all see things, learn things, and pursue things. This process is different for each of us, but as we do so, we also develop a very strong intuition of what we, personally, find fascinating about the world ‚Äî something that aligns with our deeper nature while respecting that we change over time as human beings, letting us adapt accordingly.
Interestingness isn‚Äôt hedonism or materialism or the chase of anything new and shiny that seeks to distract us. It‚Äôs deeper than that. It‚Äôs taking on that random project you had no plan to take on because you have a feeling that you might just learn something you didn‚Äôt know about yourself. It‚Äôs seeing a person you just met not as a potential partner or someone who can do something for you but simply as an individual who may open up a new, unknown, and unique dimension in your life.
The great thing about pursuing this kind of interestingness is that it has a far shorter feedback loop than specific goals. You keep doing something for as long as it‚Äôs interesting, but if you were mistaken about your initial impulse, you move on, without too much lost.
Naturally, not everything or everyone is interesting all the time, but generally speaking, if something maintains its interest over a period of time, it‚Äôs likely worth dedicating some energy to.
By making interestingness the goal, you give your actual goals a fluidity, one that can better accommodate new information. This also better amalgamates the goal with the process, rather than the goal being a distinct thing that battles to keep your attention off of the process.
More than anything, however, the pursuit of interestingness honors a simple truth about the human experience: The best things in life are by-products. They come when they come, as you commit yourself honestly to a process, not when you spend time striving for imagined perfection.
The future demands attention, and while focusing all of our energy on it is self-defeating, we do need to be intentional about directing some of our effort towards it as we orient ourselves in the world.
Goals are one way to do that. They give us a way to make concrete what is otherwise uncertain so that we can make progress without losing ourselves to anxiety. The problem, however, is that they often mistake what exists to provide orientation as a thing of value in itself.
The best way out of this trap is to pursue what is interesting ‚Äî to use our intuition for what it is that we find novel in this world to make the process and the goal one and the same thing; to continually update our sense of what is worth pursuing without being confined to false certainty.
Interestingness seeks out the riddle of life. It gives us a reason to turn the next page, to see the next scene, to give form to the unknown.
Feynman embodied this, but he also once said something that captures what it is that differentiates such a pursuit from mere goals and certainties:
Goals, incorrectly, assume that we already know what it is that we want. Interestingness is more humble. It makes up its mind as it moves, slowly blowing from one thing to another, until it eventually grasps something that lies beyond prediction.
Looking ahead, imagining scenarios that we think may be worth our time, has a place, but at the end of the day, what is most relevant is unfolding around us right now, and it doesn‚Äôt care what we thought about it yesterday.

Hardy ‚Äì Medium|"Your identity is not fixed, but highly fluid.
Your identity follows your behaviors.
How does this work?
It works based on two very important psychological concepts:
Both of these ideas are strongly related to other research in psychology, which suggests that behaviors generally come BEFORE psychological states. Again, this goes against most common wisdom.
My favorite example is the research on self-efficacy (confidence), which shows that confidence isn‚Äôt what produces high performance. But rather, that high performance is what produces confidence.
Put simply, if you want to have confidence, you can have it. All you have to do is behave in desired ways, even for a short period of time.
Why does all of this matter?
It matters, because you have the power to radically change your identity.
Even at a biological level, new science in epigenetics and neuroplasticity is showing how malleable and fluid our biology is.
Most people plateau.
Even successful people.
It‚Äôs actually very common for people who are succeeding to get stuck.
Think about some of your favorite authors, musicians, and even companies.
At some point, they generally stop being as innovative.
We all have that band we love, whose first album or two had way more soul. Then, once they became famous, their music became far more tame.
The same is often true of world-class chefs.
Once a restaurant becomes highly successful, they usually stop innovating the menu as much.
Once something is working, it‚Äôs hard to go back to ground zero.
In psychological terms, your motivation can go from approach-oriented to avoid-oriented.
Specifically, all goals are either offensive or defensive.
If you‚Äôre seeking to advance your current position, you‚Äôre ‚Äúapproaching.‚Äù
If you‚Äôre seeking to maintain your position, or avoid something bad from happening, you‚Äôre ‚Äúavoiding.‚Äù
When you‚Äôre approaching, you‚Äôre less concerned about risks and more focused on rewards. You‚Äôre willing to take risks. You‚Äôre willing to fail. You‚Äôre being PULLED forward.
When you‚Äôre avoiding, you‚Äôre less concerned about the rewards and more focused on the risks. And you have no desire to proactively confront those risks. Instead, you‚Äôre simply trying to shield yourself from any problems that come your way.
I‚Äôve seen this with many of my role models. For example, some of my favorite authors have shifted from approach-oriented to avoid-oriented.
I can see it in their work.
It‚Äôs become far more safe.
They are making far less significant ideological attempts in their writing. Their books are becoming more mainstream. Obviously calculated and less intuitive and inspired.
When you begin succeeding, your focus can shift from WHY to WHAT. Instead of operating from your core, your simply try to maintain success.
This is how you get stuck.
This is how you get confused and lose your identity.
Are you on offense or defense?
Are you approaching or avoiding?
Are you proactively becoming the person you want to be?
Or are you holding on to the person you think you are?
In the brilliant Netflix documentary, Chef‚Äôs Table, which highlights the lives of the world‚Äôs most successful chefs, one particular episode stands out.
The number one chef in Asia, Gaggan Anand, is known for spontaneously throwing out his entire menu and starting from scratch. Even when his current menu is getting lots of attention.
This may not seem like a big deal, but it is.
When a restaurant starts getting recognized and certain awards, it‚Äôs generally based on the menu and overall atmosphere.
Being literally number one in Asia, it would make sense for Gaggan to keep his restaurant how it is.
But that‚Äôs not what he does.
Creativity, and always pushing his own boundaries, is what he is about.
So just because something is working doesn‚Äôt give him permission to stop evolving.
So he reinvents himself.
Over and over and over.
No matter how hard it is to walk away from something brilliant.
A true creator never stops pushing their boundaries.
They never stop reinventing.
Once you become awesome at something, use your new LEARNING ABILITIES to become awesome at something else.
The whole notion of ‚Äúfinding your calling‚Äù has led people to having fixed views of themselves.
There isn‚Äôt just one thing you were born to do.
You can expand and grow in countless ways. Especially after you learn the process of learning. You can take all of your experience becoming great at something, and quickly become proficient at something else.
In this way, you never plateau. You‚Äôre always growing and evolving as a person.
Given that your identity is fluid and malleable, you have an amazing opportunity to redefine who you are.
All you have to do is consistently and boldly reshape your behavior.
You can do this in the form of a 30-day challenge.
What‚Äôs something you‚Äôve wanted to do, that you haven‚Äôt done?
Or, what‚Äôs something that would clearly lead you to a place you‚Äôd like to be?
It could be 30 days of extreme health and fitness.
That would definitely change things.
It could be facing an extreme fear: like 30 days of asking people on dates.
It could be 30 days of writing articles, or filming videos.
Whatever it is, if you do it for 30 days, your identity will change.
Your fears will become cauterized and neutralized.
You‚Äôll adapt to your new behaviors.
Your psychological state will change.
You‚Äôll begin to identify with your new behaviors.
Will you have to deal with some negative emotions along the way?
Will you face a load of resistance and fear?
Will you want to quit?
The answer is probably yes to all of those questions.
But THIS is how you separate yourself from the masses.
This is how you make quantum leaps in your progression, while most people make incremental progress.
This is how you consciously shape your identity and future.
Where will you be in 30 days from now?
WHO will you be 30 days from now?
I‚Äôve created a cheat sheet for putting yourself into a PEAK-STATE, immediately. You follow this daily, your life will change very quickly.
Get the cheat sheet here!

John Lafleur|20K|8|https://hackernoon.com/top-12-things-that-destroy-developer-productivity-2ddf0abc190?source=tag_archive---------9---------------------|Top 12 Things That Destroy Developer Productivity ‚Äì Hacker Noon|"A lot of articles address the role of tech leads and engineering managers. One common theme we often come across is how to increase a team‚Äôs productivity. But before you focus your energy trying to increase their productivity, you might first want to consider what‚Äôs destroying it, to have a sound base on which you can build. Unfortunately, even though Peopleware was published almost 30 years ago, we see lots of teams suffering from huge productivity loss in some (negatively) remarkable ways!
No one expects a programmer to get work done without access to a computer, but there are many companies that expect programmers to get work done without access to their mind. This is equally unrealistic.
So let‚Äôs deep dive into our list of 12 things that prevent your developers from getting ‚Äúinto the zone‚Äù and being productive. I will try to prioritize this list from most to least impactful. Feel free to comment!
If you‚Äôre wondering if all this is worth the investment, just consider the developer‚Äôs salaries. Even 10% more productivity is a LOT!
Interruptions are the top productivity killer for developers, in my mind. Developers can‚Äôt easily go back to where they were right before an interruption. They need to get into the mindset for development and then slowly trace back to where they left off. This can easily take more than 30 minutes. And the more interruptions, the more frustration, the less quality work, the more bugs ‚Äî and it goes on.
What about meetings? The only difference between a meeting and an interruption is that a meeting is a planned interruption, which makes it even worse. Developers can‚Äôt progress on a task if they know that they will have an interruption while working on it. So if they have a meeting in one or two hours, they will not be able to progress on anything, as most engineering tasks take more time.
How can this be avoided? This part is well documented; you have no excuse. Hold short status meetings at the very start of the day or just before lunch, for example, to avoid unnecessary interruptions.
Of the different types of managers, micro-managers might be the worst in terms of the developers‚Äô productivity. Sure, micro-managers tend to have more meetings and unplanned interruptions. But it‚Äôs not only that. They show a lack of trust, and by doing so, you feel they constantly undermine your skills and your ability to get things done. Any motivation a developer had between interruptions will be just gone at that point. The impact goes beyond productivity. Micro-managers might be the first reason for developers to leave, or at the very least, to change teams.
There are many ways to illustrate vagueness. Bug reports like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs broken, fix it!‚Äù don‚Äôt have enough information for developers to work off of. By the way, having a bug report template can help in that case.
Or unclear specification on a feature, in which case developers will start implementing what feels right to them, before they have to start again from scratch once the manager better details the expected behavior.
Unclear prioritization also belongs in this category. The time that a developer spends wondering if they are working on the right task can so easily be avoided. And if ever they get a comment from the manager asking why they worked on this particular task (while priorities were not defined)...well, you get it ‚Äî a lot of frustration...
Have you ever heard of it? It happens when managers are totally uninvolved in the work, but... they just swoop down once in a while to shit all over everything. ‚ÄúThis is wrong, and this, and this looks bad,‚Äù etc., before flying away again. I have to admit I loved the image, but unfortunately, this happens more often than we would like it to. This behavior is deeply frustrating to developers; they won‚Äôt be able to get back in the zone in the next few hours, and sometimes not even for days.
Have you ever had a manager or other developer who took all the credit for the work you have done in the past weeks? Developers value competence above all. Taking the credit for someone else is taking the other‚Äôs competence for yourself and removing it from him or her. This is pretty high up on my list, as I feel it creates so much tension that it just destroys the whole developers‚Äô productivity for quite a while.
This might seem strange to non-programmers, but the environment in which developers work has an important impact on their activities. For instance, having some white noise ‚Äî loud AC, hearing cars and trucks roll by ‚Äî helps them focus better. That‚Äôs why so many of us put headsets on! I actually just discovered RainyMood ‚Äî really great üëç!
Similarly, if the workspace is designed to have as much motion as possible, that won‚Äôt help them focus! Or having the desktop computer screens oriented in such a way that they are highly visible to the managers...well, that creates some extra stress and even more opportunities to be interrupted.
Scope creep (also called focus creep, requirement creep, feature creep, and sometimes kitchen sink syndrome) in project management refers to uncontrolled changes in a project‚Äôs scope. This can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled.
Scope creep turns relatively simple requests into horribly complex and time-consuming monsters! And most of the time it happens during development! For instance, for a simple feature: Version 1 (before implementation): feature is ‚ÄúShow a map of the location‚Äù Version 2 (when version 1 almost finished): feature is changed to ‚ÄúShow a 3D map of the location‚Äù Version 3 (when version 2 almost finished): feature again changed to ‚ÄúShow a 3D map of the location that the user can fly through‚Äù
So this one might seem strange at first glance, but is actually pretty easy to understand. If a product team defines its team‚Äôs priorities without ever validating (through customer feedback or any other means) the interest of the corresponding features, and the developers see that most features are eventually just not used, they will feel that what they do is useless and will lose their motivation. We all want to feel impactful, and that may be even more important to developers!
Technical debt is a deliberate decision to implement not-the-best solution or write not-the-best code to release software faster. Taking on some technical debt is inevitable and can increase speed in software development in the short run. However, in the long run, it contributes to system complexity, which slows the developers down. Non-programmers often underestimate the loss of productivity and are tempted to always move forward, and that becomes an issue. But if refactoring is never part of the priorities, it will not only impact productivity but also product quality.
Developers use many tools to program, push and merge their code every day. The more automation, the better. It goes without saying that if you use ‚Äúancient‚Äù tools, this will impact your productivity. Similarly, having a big screen vs only a laptop can have an impact. Given the cost of hardware and the developer‚Äôs salary, having just a 5% productivity gain is definitely worth any investment on that point! Just give the tools and hardware that your developer team prefers (individually for hardware, but as a group for the tools).
When learning how to code, we were told to comment early and often. The idea is that it‚Äôs better to have too many comments than to have too few. Unfortunately, many programmers incorrectly interpret this to mean that they must comment every single line of code, which is why we often see code like this (from Jeff Atwood‚Äôs post on ‚ÄúCoding Without Comments‚Äù):
Do you have any idea what this code does? Me neither. The problem is that while there are plenty of comments describing what the code is doing, there are none describing why it‚Äôs doing it. If there were a bug in the program and you stumbled across this code, you wouldn‚Äôt know where to begin.
This last one is linked to the tendency of managers to ask developers for estimates, then push them to lower those estimates as much as possible, and then magically consider them as deadlines! Managers will even consider that, as the developers themselves ‚Äúdecided‚Äù on the estimate, they committed to the deadlines, and therefore the deadlines should be considered valid enough to be shared to upper management.
Not surprisingly, developers feel that those deadlines are unreasonable and arbitrarily tight; this creates tension and an inability to focus.
How are all those things unique to developers? If you look at all 12 things, they are actually pretty common to most other project-based jobs. It‚Äôs just that the impact of each of these is even more important for developers, as they need deep focus to progress on their tasks.
If you recognize some points mentioned above within your company, it might be interesting to address them with your developers. Talk to them; find out if these are an issue and how it can be resolved. Whatever they say, the most important thing is to trust their feedback and insights. And while today‚Äôs technology is very different from 30 years ago, the lesson is still the same. You can‚Äôt ignore the human factor when you consider team productivity. Iterate on your processes, environment and work habits with your team, and let them guide you on how to have the highest productivity and impact.

But if you use the right tools, your life can be a lot easier and better.
My general opinion about apps, tools, and resources is this: It doesn‚Äôt matter.
I say that because most people hide behind their apps. We‚Äôre always looking for the ONE app that will turn us into a productivity monster.
Or we believe that tools or other resources will help us do better work.
YouTuber and filmmaker Casey Neistat makes this point very clear, he says:
When it comes to writing, Stephen King has a similar approach. Whenever he‚Äôs asked about tools, he doesn‚Äôt even answer. If you want to become a better writer, he says:
I‚Äôm sure you know there‚Äôs only one way to get things done: Put your head down and work fucking hard. But often, we still think these type of thoughts:
These are all reasons we procrastinate. Now, of course, tools matter. But they are not the determining factor. You are.
It‚Äôs not about the resources you have; it‚Äôs about what you do with them. Life is about resourcefulness. And that‚Äôs the point people like Casey Neistat and Stephen King want to make.
What you‚Äôll find next is a list of 7 of my favorite apps and how I use them. When you use the tools in the right way, you can easily save 10 hours per week.
If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre probably a knowledge worker. And a knowledge worker‚Äôs primary weapon is her words.
I strongly believe that if you want to become a better communicator, it all starts on paper. Learn how to think and write well, and you will ultimately become better at speaking, sales, copywriting, programming, doing interviews, leading, etc.
The very words you use are EVERYTHING in how you conduct yourself. Especially in an increasingly digital world where people shy away from face-to-face contact.
And Grammarly is the best tool to help you with communicating. Most people think a grammar checker is only for writers.
But I mainly use Grammarly‚Äôs browser extension for daily use. I use it for writing emails in Gmail, responding to comments, or any other site I have to write something.
I also edit my articles with Grammarly (they also have an MS Office add-on). It checks for passive voice, grammatical, spelling, and punctuation mistakes.
All in all, this app saves me about 30 minutes a day in sheer brainpower. With Grammarly, I can just focus on writing and communicating my message; they do the rest.
Reading improves focus, productivity, creativity, and it reduces stress. The benefits are so great that it makes you think everybody should be reading books like crazy.
Nope.
23% of Americans have not read a single book in the past year. And the number of books people read per year are also not pretty. Only 28% reads more than 11 books per year.
And I get it. Reading takes time. Plus, one of my main challenges is to select which books I‚Äôm going to read.
In the past, I‚Äôve often bought books, and quit them half-way through because they were not useful or interesting. That costs me time and money. That‚Äôs frustrating, especially because you can only read so many books every year.
If you‚Äôre like me, your reading list grows faster than you cross off books, and that‚Äôs a problem. Why? You want to read the RIGHT books. You want to read books that make you grow; personally, professionally, financially.
And I‚Äôve finally found a solution to the question of: ‚ÄúWhat book should I read next?‚Äù
Blinkist creates quality summaries of non-fiction books. Every day I read one book summary, and if I want to learn more, I get the actual book. If not, I just eliminate the book from my reading list.
You have to be realistic; you just can‚Äôt read all the books in the world. And it‚Äôs important to figure out how you decide which books you‚Äôre going to read.
Also, I don‚Äôt rely on reviews to select books because a book that‚Äôs useless to you can be valuable to me.
You should eliminate those two thoughts from your head. Why? Because they plant the seeds of something that‚Äôs called: WASTING TIME.
I use Trello as a backlog of tasks that I have to do. If you don‚Äôt know Trello; it‚Äôs a versatile project management tool that can be used in many ways.
With Trello you can create ‚Äòboards‚Äô for every project you have. And on every board, you can list all the actions you have to complete for that project.
Every week I take some time to update my projects. That helps me to improve my focus, so I know what I have to do.
Whenever I don‚Äôt know what to do, I open Trello: There‚Äôs ALWAYS something to do.
Browsing blogs remains one of the main sources of wasting time for most of us.
I have a simple tip for you: Stop clicking on articles you see in your social feeds.
Most people open Facebook, Twitter, or even news sites, and they click on anything thing that looks slightly interesting.
DON‚ÄôT.
Instead, make a list of 5‚Äì10 blogs/authors you love to read. Then, add them to Feedly or follow the bloggers/publications on Medium. Every day, only read your articles through Feedly and Medium.
This saves at least 1 hour of mindless browsing per week.
I still meet a lot of entrepreneurs and freelancers who don‚Äôt work in the cloud. If you‚Äôre one of them, you‚Äôre wasting a lot of time.
Just the few minutes it takes to open files from folders, save them on external drives, or share your documents with others, adds up quickly.
A few minutes here and there become a few hours a week, and hundreds of hours per year.
I use Office 365 because I like to work offline too (plus, I‚Äôm a little old school ‚Äî I‚Äôm used to Office). But Google Docs also works well.
Let‚Äôs keep this short: If you‚Äôre not working in the cloud, it‚Äôs time to move there.
I save about 1 hour per week by having easy access to all my documents (on all my devices) in the cloud. I only focus on working and sharing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
I don‚Äôt want to think about anything else that‚Äôs involved with productivity. And that‚Äôs what these apps are great at.
Forget about to-do lists, fancy productivity apps, or anything else that promises you to get shit done.
There‚Äôs only one thing that helps you to get things done: Your calendar.
It‚Äôs so obvious that most of us ignore it. We prefer fancy looking to-do lists with all colors of the rainbow, and that make sounds when you check off an item.
The research is clear: To-do lists don‚Äôt work. And yet, most people stick to them.
Ditch the to-do list and use your calendar as your number one productivity tool. Take some time to plan your week. Ask: When will I do what? Then, schedule it in your calendar. I do this exercise every day.
I promise that it will save you at least 15 minutes a day of updating your to-do list.
I love working with the Pomodoro method. Research shows that it improves focus and the quality of your output.
Whenever I don‚Äôt use an app like Tomighty, I just waste hours every day. This app can easily save you one hour per DAY.
How? When you work in intervals, you get more done in less time because of the improved focus.
As you might have noticed, productivity is all about eliminating time-wasting activities, and improving your focus.
In that way you get the RIGHT things done, and you ultimately save a lot of hours every week.
Start living more consciously of your time and productivity: Save your time for other, more important, things.
If you do that, you can use those precious hours with your family, friends, spouse. Or you can spend the time to improve your skills.
Because at the end of the ride, when you‚Äôre on your deathbed, you won‚Äôt think about all apps, tools, or resources you used. No, you‚Äôll reflect on all the great things you did with them.
So what are you waiting for? You have the tools you need to be successful. Only thing left is this: Go out and DO things with the resources you have.

Focus on This Instead. ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"We all have things that we want to achieve in our lives ‚Äî getting into better shape, building a successful business, raising a wonderful family, writing a best-selling book, winning a championship, and so on.
And for most of us, the path to those things starts by setting a specific and actionable goal. At least, this is how I approached my life until recently. I would set goals for classes I took, for weights that I wanted to lift in the gym, and for clients I wanted in my business.
What I‚Äôm starting to realize, however, is that when it comes to actually getting things done and making progress in the areas that are important to you, there is a much better way to do things.
It all comes down to the difference between goals and systems.
Let me explain.
What‚Äôs the difference between goals and systems?
Now for the really interesting question:
For example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day, would you still get results?
I think you would.
As an example, I just added up the total word count for the articles I‚Äôve written this year. (You can see them all here.) In the last 12 months, I‚Äôve written over 115,000 words. The typical book is about 50,000 to 60,000 words, so I have written enough to fill two books this year.
All of this is such a surprise because I never set a goal for my writing. I didn‚Äôt measure my progress in relation to some benchmark. I never set a word count goal for any particular article. I never said, ‚ÄúI want to write two books this year.‚Äù
What I did focus on was writing one article every Monday and Thursday. And after sticking to that schedule for 11 months, the result was 115,000 words. I focused on my system and the process of doing the work. In the end, I enjoyed the same (or perhaps better) results.
Let‚Äôs talk about three more reasons why you should focus on systems instead of goals.
When you‚Äôre working toward a goal, you are essentially saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good enough yet, but I will be when I reach my goal.‚Äù
The problem with this mindset is that you‚Äôre teaching yourself to always put happiness and success off until the next milestone is achieved. ‚ÄúOnce I reach my goal, then I‚Äôll be happy. Once I achieve my goal, then I‚Äôll be successful.‚Äù
SOLUTION: Commit to a process, not a goal.
Choosing a goal puts a huge burden on your shoulders. Can you imagine if I had made it my goal to write two books this year? Just writing that sentence stresses me out.
But we do this to ourselves all the time. We place unnecessary stress on ourselves to lose weight or to succeed in business or to write a best-selling novel. Instead, you can keep things simple and reduce stress by focusing on the daily process and sticking to your schedule, rather than worrying about the big, life-changing goals.
When you focus on the practice instead of the performance, you can enjoy the present moment and improve at the same time.
You might think your goal will keep you motivated over the long-term, but that‚Äôs not always true.
Consider someone training for a half-marathon. Many people will work hard for months, but as soon as they finish the race, they stop training. Their goal was to finish the half-marathon and now that they have completed it, that goal is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it?
This can create a type of ‚Äúyo-yo effect‚Äù where people go back and forth from working on a goal to not working on one. This type of cycle makes it difficult to build upon your progress for the long-term.
SOLUTION: Release the need for immediate results.
I was training at the gym last week and I was doing my second-to-last set of clean and jerks. When I hit that rep, I felt a small twinge in my leg. It wasn‚Äôt painful or an injury, just a sign of fatigue near the end of my workout. For a minute or two, I thought about doing my final set. Then, I reminded myself that I plan to do this for the rest of my life and decided to call it a day.
In a situation like the one above, a goal-based mentality will tell you to finish the workout and reach your goal. After all, if you set a goal and you don‚Äôt reach it, then you feel like a failure.
But with a systems-based mentality, I had no trouble moving on. Systems-based thinking is never about hitting a particular number, it‚Äôs about sticking to the process and not missing workouts.
Of course, I know that if I never miss a workout, then I will lift bigger weights in the long-run. And that‚Äôs why systems are more valuable than goals. Goals are about the short-term result. Systems are about the long-term process. In the end, process always wins.
You can‚Äôt predict the future. (I know, shocking.)
But every time we set a goal, we try to do it. We try to plan out where we will be and when we will make it there. We try to predict how quickly we can make progress, even though we have no idea what circumstances or situations will arise along the way.
SOLUTION: Build feedback loops.
Each Friday, I spend 15 minutes filling out a small spreadsheet with the most critical metrics for my business. For example, in one column I calculate the conversion rate (the percentage of website visitors that join my free email newsletter each week). I rarely think about this number, but checking that column each week provides a feedback loop that tells me if I‚Äôm doing things right. When that number drops, I know that I need to send high quality traffic to my site.
Feedback loops are important for building good systems because they allow you to keep track of many different pieces without feeling the pressure to predict what is going to happen with everything. Forget about predicting the future and build a system that can signal when you need to make adjustments.
None of this is to say that goals are useless. However, I‚Äôve found that goals are good for planning your progress and systems are good for actually making progress.
Goals can provide direction and even push you forward in the short-term, but eventually a well-designed system will always win. Having a system is what matters. Committing to the process is what makes the difference.

I remember the first time I really experienced the power of shortcuts. A friend of mine did 3D modeling in Autodesk Maya, and I asked him to show me one of his projects. As he manipulated the canvas, I watched in disbelief as his hands never touched the mouse. He was zooming in and out, selecting and moving vertices, positioning the camera, and creating new objects on the screen...all from the keyboard.
According to him, he hadn‚Äôt had a mouse in two or three months, and couldn‚Äôt really be bothered to get one, so he just taught himself how to get by without it.
I thought he was crazy, but was silently fascinated by his ability to operate such a complicated application so nimbly and masterfully without the single-most necessary input device in computing.
But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs uncommon. When you use an application every day, whether you‚Äôre a creative or an accountant, you start to crave efficiencies ‚Äî tiny little things you can do to make your job faster and easier ‚Äî so you can spend time doing more important things like hanging around the water cooler to talk about the latest season of Stranger Things.
The first week or so of learning a new shortcut or hotkey will be strictly recall. You might even need to write it down. The trick is to force yourself to use the shortcut at all costs, even if it means taking the time to look it up.
You‚Äôre training your brain to learn the keys, and your muscles to remember the shapes the shortcuts form on the keyboard.
After the first week, muscle memory takes over. You won‚Äôt have to look at the keyboard for Command-Shift-J (reveal layer in layer list) or Control-Command-H (distribute objects horizontally). Before you know it, you‚Äôll have a large toolbox of efficiency tricks that save you hours throughout the week.
Here are some techniques I use to speed up my Sketch workflow:
If this is the only thing you learn from this article, then it‚Äôs a win for us both.
Open your system preferences and find the Keyboard panel. Did you know that you can create your own custom keyboard shortcuts for any menu item in any application?
I remember being frustrated that seemingly-common actions in Sketch (alignment, in particular) didn‚Äôt have default shortcuts out of the box. Luckily, I learned how easy it was to create application-specific shortcuts in this hidden Mac menu.
The syntax is simple. Start by finding the action in the Sketch menu (use Help if you can‚Äôt find it).
Once you‚Äôve located the action, write down the menu map that gets you to that action, separating each ‚Äústep‚Äù with a ‚Äú->‚Äù. That‚Äôs a hyphen then a greater than symbol. Don‚Äôt forget the top menu.
So the menu map for ‚ÄúAlign Objects Left‚Äù would be:
Make sure you don‚Äôt add any extra spaces. Once you‚Äôve written out the menu mapping, click into the Keyboard Shortcut box and assign a key combination that will trigger this action. Don‚Äôt make it too obscure...if it‚Äôs align left, use something obvious like Control-Command-Left Arrow.
I promise I‚Äôm not affiliated with BetterTouchTool, but I am a massive fan. BetterTouchTool is the absolute best application for taking control of your Mac and making it work the way you want.
The app lets you configure and perform actions using all kinds of methods: via keyboard, mouse, trackpad, drawing, Siri, Apple Remote, and more. Shortcut actions can be set to work globally or only in specific applications.
My four favorite BetterTouchTool actions help me align objects in Sketch. You‚Äôll first have to create menu maps and shortcuts using the Apple Keyboard shortcut menu from Tip #1, then you can assign this shortcut to trigger however you want.
Here are four that I‚Äôve configured that I could not live without:
These gestures have become so second-nature to me that it‚Äôs painful to work on other computers that don‚Äôt have them configured. I‚Äôve found a trackpad gesture to be far superior than just a keyboard shortcut because I don‚Äôt have to reach for the keys. It‚Äôs such a natural movement to ‚Äúflick‚Äù an object to the left to align it to the left.
Oh, for you mouse users? Just...I don‚Äôt know...stop? I kid, I kid. But really, I‚Äôve found the trackpad to be 10x more efficient (not necessarily faster!) than a mouse. Multitouch gestures make things feel natural, and you literally have a wealth of actions at your fingertips. I mean look at all the gestures my trackpad is picking up:
If we‚Äôre getting technical, yes, the Magic Mouse is both a trackpad and a mouse, but after using it for about a year, I still found a trackpad to be better.
Just a personal preference!
But really, you should just use a trackpad.
One of the handiest plugins for Sketch has to be the Content Generator. You can use it to quickly generate placeholder text, names, profile pictures, etc. If you‚Äôve never used it, download it now.
If I had a nickel for every time I‚Äôve had to generate a list of names or fill a list with profile pictures, I swear I could host a catered In-N-Out Burger lunch for every food delivery tech startup in The Valley.
There are four main actions I perform with the Content Generator on a regular basis, and they‚Äôre all very related:
I rarely perform one without the other(s), so I created shortcuts to run these actions for me. Each action in the shortcut ‚Äúgroup‚Äù begins with Control+Alt+Command combination, then I use modifier keys next to each other on the keyboard to fire the desired action:
By grouping these shortcuts in close proximity to each other, it‚Äôs less cognitive load for me to remember all of them individually. I effectively get four shortcuts for the price of one. It‚Äôs simple to remember F for ‚Äúfemale‚Äù, and I know the female name shortcut is the key just below it.
Don‚Äôt stop at Sketch shortcuts! As any great designer knows, you‚Äôll be switching between Sketch and at least four other applications hundreds of times per day while you work:
Command+Tab is useful for switching between adjacent apps (that is, the app you were in before the current one), but you have to hit tab a couple times to visit apps further back in your focus history, and we all know that you‚Äôll pass over the right app at least once.
Spotlight is useful for opening apps, but you still have to type the name of the app, and depending on what Spotlight is indexing on your computer, you might end up opening something like ‚Äúsketches_nov2015.png‚Äù on accident instead of Sketch the app.
Instead, I use shortcuts to open my favorite apps:
In the image above, notice that these are global shortcuts, so they will override any local application shortcut. That means I know with 100% certainty that Control+Option+S will open Sketch (or bring it into focus) every single time. Pretty convenient in the long run.
Don‚Äôt forget: Use an obvious modifier letter so you don‚Äôt forget the shortcut. That is, don‚Äôt launch Sketch with the letter Q, unless you‚Äôre going for ‚ÄúQuite Extraordinary Design Application‚Äù...
But that would just be silly.
Brace yourselves for some shocking news:
Have you ever used this online search engine called Google? It‚Äôs pretty popular. If not, you should check it out.
We‚Äôre in the Google Age where you can type exactly what you want and Google will magically find what you‚Äôre looking for. If you don‚Äôt think this is the most magical thing to happen to planet Earth in the last billion years, then I bet you weren‚Äôt all that impressed with Hamilton, either. For shame.
Here‚Äôs the thing. Spotlight on your shiny Mac works just about the same way. You can configure it to search whatever the H you want it to, and when you conjure up Spotlight with Command+Spacebar, it will search for only those types of things on your computer.
Stop thumbing your way through Finder to locate a design file like Don Draper flipping through his paper Rolodex. This is the 21st Century and you‚Äôre smarter than that! Just type in the name of the file, press Enter, and presto! The file is open.
Note: If you‚Äôre typing in an application name, it will show you the most recent files on the right side. It‚Äôs a convenient way to recall a recent file if you can‚Äôt remember the name of it.
There you have it! Five slick ways to work faster and more efficiently! Now you have extra time to work on that callipygian figure of yours üçë. If you don‚Äôt get that reference, then you didn‚Äôt read the article :)

Alejandro Russo|319|3|https://medium.com/@russo/how-to-increase-results-by-37-8x-9164c7bde0db?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|A Quick Hack to Grow Anything 37x ‚Äì Alejandro Russo ‚Äì Medium|"This is one of my favorite posters:
It‚Äôs not the prettiest poster, but it has profound meaning.
So, what‚Äôs the message behind these numbers?
This simple equation says that:
Put in a fancier way:
And in an even fancier way:
Olympic athletes live by this. There are no shortcuts to the top and major breakthroughs happen after periods of small, but sustained growth.
There‚Äôs simply no way around hard-work.
It‚Äôs better for a bodybuilder to improve 1% every training session, than to have a sudden 10% increase in muscle mass. The ladder will usually result in imbalance (injury, diet sickness, hormonal mess, etc.).
Entrepreneurs also have this embedded in their work ethos.
Software development advances in terms of sprints: bite-sized, frequent iterations. For example, the Facebook app is updated every 2 weeks. New versions are just a tiny bit better than previous ones ‚Äî but within one year you‚Äôll have a way better Facebook than you did 12 months ago.
Not only is this practice helpful in the build-measure-learn-repeat product cycle, but it‚Äôs also beneficial to the end users, who are usually resistant to big change.
Even though 1% doesn‚Äôt sound like much, improving just 1% every day requires military discipline and a deep sense of commitment.
Try doing something small ‚Äî it can be anything ‚Äî every day for 365 days straight. It‚Äôs not easy. This is why diets, even though they can be very simple to understand, are very hard to follow through until the end.
Start with something little. The key is to not even think about it; it has to be like brushing your teeth. For most people (hopefully), brushing their teeth is an automatic action performed at the same time, same place, every day.
If it‚Äôs a book, make sure you write a page every day, just one page. If you want to get in shape, make sure to exercise every day. If you‚Äôre starting a business, make sure you write down that daily to-do list and not let go until every item has been done.
The key is to fill that list with bite-sized, actionable items that can be addresses immediately:
Commit to doing this for 3 days straight. Then 1 week. Then 1 month. And keep on incrementing, little by little. They say that a new habit is formed after 60 days of continuous behavior. After that, you‚Äôll pretty much get used to this.
Get it done.
The upside is that small improvements are less painful than big actions. Persistence and discipline can be trained like a muscle. That‚Äôs the beauty.
If you need money to go on vacation, it‚Äôs way easier to save just $3.00/day than to cough up a lump sum of $1,095 (*I recommend the Acorns app for this).
Bite-sized improvements are not as fun or glamorous as big changes. But trust me... in a year you‚Äôll look back and be impressed with how far you‚Äôve gone.

Hardy|38K|5|https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/this-30-day-challenge-will-transform-your-identity-and-explode-your-success-813a76427652?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|How To Change Your Life In 30 Days ‚Äì Benjamin P. Hardy ‚Äì Medium|"Your identity is not fixed, but highly fluid.
Your identity follows your behaviors.
How does this work?
It works based on two very important psychological concepts:
Both of these ideas are strongly related to other research in psychology, which suggests that behaviors generally come BEFORE psychological states. Again, this goes against most common wisdom.
My favorite example is the research on self-efficacy (confidence), which shows that confidence isn‚Äôt what produces high performance. But rather, that high performance is what produces confidence.
Put simply, if you want to have confidence, you can have it. All you have to do is behave in desired ways, even for a short period of time.
Why does all of this matter?
It matters, because you have the power to radically change your identity.
Even at a biological level, new science in epigenetics and neuroplasticity is showing how malleable and fluid our biology is.
Most people plateau.
Even successful people.
It‚Äôs actually very common for people who are succeeding to get stuck.
Think about some of your favorite authors, musicians, and even companies.
At some point, they generally stop being as innovative.
We all have that band we love, whose first album or two had way more soul. Then, once they became famous, their music became far more tame.
The same is often true of world-class chefs.
Once a restaurant becomes highly successful, they usually stop innovating the menu as much.
Once something is working, it‚Äôs hard to go back to ground zero.
In psychological terms, your motivation can go from approach-oriented to avoid-oriented.
Specifically, all goals are either offensive or defensive.
If you‚Äôre seeking to advance your current position, you‚Äôre ‚Äúapproaching.‚Äù
If you‚Äôre seeking to maintain your position, or avoid something bad from happening, you‚Äôre ‚Äúavoiding.‚Äù
When you‚Äôre approaching, you‚Äôre less concerned about risks and more focused on rewards. You‚Äôre willing to take risks. You‚Äôre willing to fail. You‚Äôre being PULLED forward.
When you‚Äôre avoiding, you‚Äôre less concerned about the rewards and more focused on the risks. And you have no desire to proactively confront those risks. Instead, you‚Äôre simply trying to shield yourself from any problems that come your way.
I‚Äôve seen this with many of my role models. For example, some of my favorite authors have shifted from approach-oriented to avoid-oriented.
I can see it in their work.
It‚Äôs become far more safe.
They are making far less significant ideological attempts in their writing. Their books are becoming more mainstream. Obviously calculated and less intuitive and inspired.
When you begin succeeding, your focus can shift from WHY to WHAT. Instead of operating from your core, your simply try to maintain success.
This is how you get stuck.
This is how you get confused and lose your identity.
Are you on offense or defense?
Are you approaching or avoiding?
Are you proactively becoming the person you want to be?
Or are you holding on to the person you think you are?
In the brilliant Netflix documentary, Chef‚Äôs Table, which highlights the lives of the world‚Äôs most successful chefs, one particular episode stands out.
The number one chef in Asia, Gaggan Anand, is known for spontaneously throwing out his entire menu and starting from scratch. Even when his current menu is getting lots of attention.
This may not seem like a big deal, but it is.
When a restaurant starts getting recognized and certain awards, it‚Äôs generally based on the menu and overall atmosphere.
Being literally number one in Asia, it would make sense for Gaggan to keep his restaurant how it is.
But that‚Äôs not what he does.
Creativity, and always pushing his own boundaries, is what he is about.
So just because something is working doesn‚Äôt give him permission to stop evolving.
So he reinvents himself.
Over and over and over.
No matter how hard it is to walk away from something brilliant.
A true creator never stops pushing their boundaries.
They never stop reinventing.
Once you become awesome at something, use your new LEARNING ABILITIES to become awesome at something else.
The whole notion of ‚Äúfinding your calling‚Äù has led people to having fixed views of themselves.
There isn‚Äôt just one thing you were born to do.
You can expand and grow in countless ways. Especially after you learn the process of learning. You can take all of your experience becoming great at something, and quickly become proficient at something else.
In this way, you never plateau. You‚Äôre always growing and evolving as a person.
Given that your identity is fluid and malleable, you have an amazing opportunity to redefine who you are.
All you have to do is consistently and boldly reshape your behavior.
You can do this in the form of a 30-day challenge.
What‚Äôs something you‚Äôve wanted to do, that you haven‚Äôt done?
Or, what‚Äôs something that would clearly lead you to a place you‚Äôd like to be?
It could be 30 days of extreme health and fitness.
That would definitely change things.
It could be facing an extreme fear: like 30 days of asking people on dates.
It could be 30 days of writing articles, or filming videos.
Whatever it is, if you do it for 30 days, your identity will change.
Your fears will become cauterized and neutralized.
You‚Äôll adapt to your new behaviors.
Your psychological state will change.
You‚Äôll begin to identify with your new behaviors.
Will you have to deal with some negative emotions along the way?
Will you face a load of resistance and fear?
Will you want to quit?
The answer is probably yes to all of those questions.
But THIS is how you separate yourself from the masses.
This is how you make quantum leaps in your progression, while most people make incremental progress.
This is how you consciously shape your identity and future.
Where will you be in 30 days from now?
WHO will you be 30 days from now?
I‚Äôve created a cheat sheet for putting yourself into a PEAK-STATE, immediately. You follow this daily, your life will change very quickly.
Get the cheat sheet here!

Srinivas Rao|19.6K|9|https://medium.com/the-mission/how-writing-1000-words-a-day-changed-my-life-cf72453b8fef?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|How Writing 1000 Words a Day Changed my Life ‚Äì The Mission ‚Äì Medium|"When I interviewed Julien Smith for the first time in 2012, he had one of the most popular blogs on the internet. Of all the things he shared with me in our conversation, one thing he said stood out to me. I write 1000 words every day.
Shortly after that conversation I started writing 1000 words a day and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been doing ever since. To say that the habit changed my life would be an understatement.
What started first out of curiosity, eventually turned into something that I had to do out of necessity. The demands on my production increased dramatically almost overnight.
In order to keep up with the demand, I had to develop a system.
As I‚Äôve said before, systems are essential to increasing your creative output. 1000 words a day became my system. Within a few months it was a habit so deeply ingrained into my life that it was like brushing my teeth. And that‚Äôs when things started to get really interesting.
As part of my 1000 words I would publish a really long Facebook status update, what I jokingly referred to as committing career suicide one status update at a time. After a few months my writing started resonating with people like it never had before. In September of 2013, I compiled all of my Facebook status updates into a google doc, had it edited, had Mars Dorian design a book cover, uploaded it to Amazon and called it the Art of Being Unmistakable.
The first week it sold 300 copies and I considered that a success. But about three weeks later, a media circus erupted. When I check the rankings on Amazon, I noticed that my book was #1 in the entrepreneurship category. When I tweeted about it, somebody said ‚Äúyou might want to thank Glenn Beck. He raved about your book on his show today.‚Äù When I asked a friend she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you realize how big a deal this is, check your sales.‚Äù When I logged into the Amazon dashboard, I noticed that the book had sold 1000 copies in a day. Shortly after that I ended up being on the Glenn Beck show and my self published book became a Wall Street Journal Best Seller.
Between 2013 and 2015, I never stopped writing 1000 words a day. A few months into 2015, I got the following email from an editor at Penguin Portfolio.
I recently rejoined publishing after working at online education startups, having just left Skillshare to join the Penguin Random House team. While it might seem counterintuitive, I came back just for this specific division that works and thinks differently than most of the industry ‚Äî and is setting out to help entrepreneurs and changemakers with the stories, experiences, and motivation of people who have successfully forged their own path, people like Seth Godin, Guy Kawasaki, Ryan Holiday, Nir Eyal, Nick Bilton, and more. You are one of those people, and are top of my list of who to contact to work on a book together.
Writing in many ways is like planting seeds. You plant seeds today for the person you eventually want to become. After a few conversations, my daily writing habit resulted in a 2 book deal. The first book Unmistakable: Why Only is Better Than Best was released on August 2, 2016. And I‚Äôm currently working on my second book.
So how exactly do you incorporate this habit into your life?
You have to design an environment that‚Äôs conducive to the person you want to become. If you want to become a writer, your environment should reflect that. If you came to my apartment you would notice two things:
1) I read a lot of books
2) I have stacks of Moleskine notebooks
It‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôd notice something similar in the environment of anybody else who is a writer. When I ate dinner at Tucker Max‚Äôs house for the first time, the first thing that caught my attention was the sheer number of books he had. In Ryan Holiday‚Äôs post about maintaining a physical library you‚Äôll see that he has multiple bookshelves that are filled from floor to ceiling.
In his book The Happiness Advantage, the author Shawn Achor talks about how reducing the amount of energy it takes to do something increases the likelihood you‚Äôll do it. Something as simple as decreasing the number of mouse clicks to do something will increase your odds of doing it.
The simple hack for this is using a distraction free writing tool like Macjournal. Set it up the night before, so when you flip open your laptop in the morning, it‚Äôs the first thing you see. Then you just write. If you prefer to write with a paper notebook, put it out with a pen the night before. The simple act of putting your notebook out the night before with a pen increases the likelihood that you‚Äôll actually follow through on writing.
Another variation of this hack is to write one sentence the night before, ideally right before you go to sleep. Write down somebody else‚Äôs words. Suddenly the page appears less daunting. This is one of the many reasons I always read before I write. Since your brain makes progress towards a goal based on how close it thinks it is towards that goal, starting with a quote allows you tap into the power of success accelerants.
It‚Äôs likely your early writing efforts will be lousy. Don‚Äôt be afraid to write a shitty first sentence. To this day only a small amount of what I produce on a daily basis is actually usable. But when you write 7000 words a week, you don‚Äôt need much to be useable. Say you write 1000 words a week that are decent. That‚Äôs 52,000 words. That‚Äôs one book in a year. Your cumulative output matters more than any individual writing day. If you want to become a better writer, start by becoming a prolific one.
It‚Äôs possible during the course of 90 minutes of writing that you‚Äôll wander. This happens to me all the time. I‚Äôll get 3‚Äì4 paragraphs into a train of thought and suddenly I‚Äôm writing stream of consciousness psychobabble. At this point your natural temptation will be to give up or give into a source of distraction. But if you can resist this temptation and just let the verbal vomit show up on the page, you‚Äôll get back to a place of making sense. In that sense it‚Äôs a bit like meditation. You simply observe the wandering mind and return to focusing on your breath.
Inspiration is an unreliable strategy for creative work. The muse is a fickle mistress and she tends to show up on her own schedule. You on the other hand have the option to show up every day. By showing up every day, you tap into the profound power of consistency. Something that starts as an item on your to do list eventually becomes a habit and you start to build momentum.
On a related note- if you struggle with habits, I‚Äôve put a guide together on optimizing productivity & creativity. Sign up for my newsletter here and you‚Äôll receive it shortly.
Inspiration has a funny way of striking at unusual times. Usually you‚Äôre not in front of the computer when this happens. A habit I picked up from my friend AJ Leon is to always carry a notebook. A notebook is like fertile soil where you can plant seeds for your creative ideas.
If you pay attention to how you work, you‚Äôll start to see patterns. These patterns are incredibly useful in helping you to develop systems and mental models for you to get your work done. They give you a personal operating manual for yourself. Recognizing patterns helps you adjust your behavior to reach optimal levels of performance.
These patterns play themselves out throughout our lives. Not just in our work. They occur in nearly every situation. You might notice something as simple as a phrase in an email that always elicits a positive response. If that‚Äôs the case it makes no sense to deviate from that pattern.
You might think that adjusting to patterns might make your life repetitive and boring, but the opposite seems to be true. The beauty of recognizing patterns in your life is that it frees up your cognitive bandwidth for much higher value activities than trying to decide how you plan to behave for the day. Recognizing patterns in your life requires you to take actually take time, slow down and reflect on the results that your behavior is producing.
If x causes y, then it would make sense that you choose the x that causes the y that you want. As you recognize patterns you‚Äôll begin not only work more efficiently but work more effectively. By utilizing the patterns you recognize to develop processes and systems, you free your mind up to think creatively. If your mind is taxed with decisions like how long and how much you‚Äôre depleting your willpower.
One of the most valuable sections of the BestSelf journal is Lessons learned for the day. We learn tons of lessons every day, but without the discipline to capture them, it‚Äôs no better than if we didn‚Äôt learn them at all. In fact this idea of patterns was inspired by a lesson I learned yesterday which was that 90 minutes of deep work was my consistent sweet spot. Once I saw that pattern I started looking for other ones. As you recognize patterns in your life, you‚Äôll go from a frenetic scatterbrained pace to one that is fast paced, focused, sustainable and generates momentum.
There‚Äôs a point at which any habit you adopt eventually becomes a part of who you are. You no longer have to think about it. It‚Äôs what James Clear refers to as an identity based habit If you see in me in a coffeeshop, at a conference, or anywhere else before 8am, it‚Äôs more than likely you‚Äôll find me writing 1000 words. This is no longer something I just do. It‚Äôs who I am. In order for a habit to truly change your life, it has to become a practice, likely one that is lifelong.

Wm Leler|1K|7|https://hackernoon.com/the-best-display-for-programming-8aad0be4227d?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|The Best Display for Programming? ‚Äì Hacker Noon|"[If you‚Äôre the kind of person who loves programming on your smallish laptop, you can stop reading now.]
If you are a software developer and you‚Äôre like me, you may find that you are far more productive when you have enough real estate. I‚Äôm not talking about cubicle space, I‚Äôm talking about screen real estate: large monitors and usually more than one of ‚Äôem (at least until now).
I own three 30-inch Apple Cinema displays, but I typically used only two of them on a single computer (most laptops can only drive two of them at once; some can only drive a single monitor).
When 4K monitors came out I was intrigued. When they came down in price I was excited. And when my wife and I moved into a one-room condo downtown and realized that we had to significantly downsize, I had an idea: get a single 4K monitor and use it instead of multiple monitors (and use it for watching movies too, so we wouldn‚Äôt need a separate TV).
I liked the resolution of the 30-inch monitors, which is 2560 by 1600 pixels. That is 100.63 pixels per inch (PPI). For programming I didn‚Äôt care about having a high pixel density (like Retina displays do, which have a device pixel ratio greater than one). I wanted more text characters, not slightly smoother looking ones. A 4K display has a resolution of 3840 by 2160, more than the number of pixels on two 30-inch monitors. My question was, in order to ensure that the pixels would have the same PPI, what size 4K monitor should I buy?
I calculated that the proper size for a 4K monitor was around 43 inches (diagonal). I quickly found one, the Dell P4317Q, and it had a reasonable price and good reviews. It has a TFT active matrix panel that looks really sharp with good color. Despite being called a 43-inch monitor it is actually 42.5 inches, so it has 103.7 PPI, but that difference is negligible (and I think I actually like the slightly smaller physical size better).
I had been worried that a 43-inch monitor might feel too huge. I used to own a 42-inch 1080p HDTV set (we gave it away before moving into the condo). I couldn‚Äôt imagine sitting close enough to use it as a monitor, however at 4K resolution a monitor that size is fine.
My 43-inch monitor is around 70% of the physical width of two 30-inch monitors placed side-by-side, so it takes up less desk space (which is important on my new, smaller desk). And my eyes don‚Äôt have to move left or right as far anymore.
I quickly found other advantages to this setup. The MacOS feature of having multiple desktop spaces became easier to use with a single large monitor. I can put my social media pages in a separate space so they don‚Äôt distract me while I‚Äôm working.
The only thing I don‚Äôt like about the Dell monitor are that its HDMI inputs are version 1.4, which can only do a 30Hz refresh rate at full resolution. But it also has DisplayPort inputs, which can do 60Hz, so I use DisplayPort (or mini-DisplayPort) to connect to my computer. DisplayPort and mini-DisplayPort are well supported on Apple, Windows, and Linux computers.
The next problem was that I liked it so much that I wanted the same setup at work (where I still used two 30-inch monitors). Just about that time, Viewsonic came out with a very similar monitor, the VX4380 (in fact, so similar that I believe it uses the same panel). So I bought one of those too.
How do these two monitors compare?
Both have four inputs: two DisplayPort and two HDMI. Both are excellent monitors. In fact, both are pretty much perfect!
I‚Äôve been using them for a few months, and I like using one 43-inch 4K monitor far better than using two 30-inch monitors. As a programmer, I can have a large IDE window, program output, debugging window, github, gitter, terminals, logs, multiple documentation windows, and various other windows open and usable at all times. If I need to edit a large diagram or photograph I can really enlarge it without having to stretch it across multiple monitors.
And through the miracle of mass production for the consumer 4K TV market, you‚Äôll probably pay less for a 4K monitor than if you bought a single 30-inch monitor with a resolution of 2560 by 1600 (let alone two).
By the time you read this, there might be other 43-inch 4K monitors available. You should check them out too. I just noticed the LG 43UD79-B, which even has a USB-C video input (Thunderbolt 3 or DisplayPort over USB-C) , but I haven‚Äôt tried it. It too appears to use the same panel as the Dell and Viewsonic monitors.
If you are looking at other monitors, note that I would avoid buying a display sold mainly for home viewing of TV and movies. They usually don‚Äôt have the inputs you want, and are usually less sharp because you don‚Äôt typically sit two feet away from them. You may pay slightly more for a real computer monitor, but it is worth it. As a bonus, a large computer monitor will work great for watching movies (although depending on the monitor, you may need to get some good self-powered speakers). If you want to watch TV you will need to plug it into a cable box or a streaming box of some kind (HDMI inputs will come in handy for that).
Your computer must be able to drive the required resolution and scan rate (3840 by 2160 at 60Hz). In fact, I had to upgrade one of my work computers (a 2014 MacBook Air; my employer traded it for a used 2015 one that works fine). Your computer‚Äôs video connectors should be:
I‚Äôve seen a couple of cases on the internet where people could not get a 4K monitor to work, even though the computer should have been able to drive it. According to them, the problem turned out to be old or bad cables. Unfortunately, most monitor cables are not labeled so it is difficult to know if they are the proper DisplayPort 1.2 or HDMI 2.0 (or higher). If you have problems, trying buying a new cable of the right version. One person I read about even found that the cable that came with their monitor was the wrong version, and wouldn‚Äôt work at 60Hz. And don‚Äôt even think about using DVI or VGA.
Finally, keep the number of adapters between your computer and monitor to a minimum: a single cable with no adapters if possible. My work computer has Thunderbolt 3 with USB-C connectors for video (the new Apple standard), so I bought a USB-C to DisplayPort cable. My home computer is mini-DisplayPort (the old Apple standard), so I use a mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable. Both work great, which should be no surprise because the Thunderbolt 3 video signal is the same as DisplayPort, and mini-DisplayPort is just a smaller connector for DisplayPort.
I also bought a DisplayPort KVM so I can use one keyboard, video (monitor), and mouse with two different computers. It works fine with two computers that have mini-DisplayPort outputs, but when I tried to use it with my computer that has Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) output, it would not work. Apparently, having a Thunderbolt 3 to mini-DisplayPort adapter followed by the KVM was just too much. My workaround was to use a USB-C to DisplayPort cable, skip the KVM and plug it directly into a separate input on the monitor. If anyone has figured out how to use a KVM with Thunderbolt 3, let me know in the comments.
tl;dr 43-inch 4K computer monitors should be the new hotness for people who like big monitors. And they should work well with almost any computer made in the last couple of years, as long as you use the proper cables.

That‚Äôs almost twice as many as New York.
It‚Äôs one of the most densely populated areas in the world; a relatively small region with more than seven million people crammed into it. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs forced them to build upwards instead of outwards. The skyline is a spectacle to be experienced.
Expats from North America and Europe can be found in large numbers there. There‚Äôs a constant recycling of people, and a vast majority of them make one observation in particular.
The byproduct of a small area and upward development is that homes are often significantly smaller than most Westerners are used to. They feel cramped, and even more money doesn‚Äôt buy too much more. It‚Äôs a big incentive for them to spend as little time there as possible.
The result is a more vibrant and lively expat community. People spend more time outside doing things, and you can feel it in the general atmosphere on almost any day of the week.
Of course, this isn‚Äôt hard science. Correlation doesn‚Äôt imply causation. You might easily reason that the result is simply because Hong Kong is a major metropolitan area and people away from home want to make the most out of their experience, so they get out and do more.
That would overlook one thing. The general consistency with which people from big cities and small, people that have only ever lived in one city or five, and people from one country or another all seem to notice the difference. Herd bias? Maybe. Or maybe not.
Environment design is one of the most important factors influencing behavior in our lives. It‚Äôs subtle but incredibly powerful, and in different contexts, it can be manipulated for personal benefit.
Here is how.
Almost everyone has a habit they wish they didn‚Äôt have. It can be anything from binge eating to procrastination. It often feels like no matter how hard we try to avoid it, somehow, this habit continues to find its way into our lives. It isn‚Äôt easy to get rid of.
For most of us, to eliminate a bad behavior, our first instinct is to set a goal and a deadline, hoping we follow through by not acting. Rarely is there a strategy in place, and even more rarely are the circumstances around our behavior evaluated. That‚Äôs a problem.
If we break down bad behaviors, we find that they‚Äôre guided by certain negative influences. These act as pivots in our environment that push us to move in a particular direction. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you choose not to want to do it. As long as the pivot is there, you‚Äôll automatically act.
Paco Underhill is an environmental psychologist and the author of Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping. He‚Äôs spent 25 years researching shopping behavior, and he suggests that up to half the things we buy at a grocery store, we have no intention of getting when we walk in.
The reason for this is that stores are savvy at subconscious marketing. They use psychology to leverage behavioral details, so they can deliberately design their layouts to maximize revenue.
For example, stores place expensive brands at eye level so that they‚Äôre more visible and thus more likely to be bought. Similarly, they leave candy by the checkout line because they know that by then we‚Äôre tired of making decisions, and it‚Äôs more likely to be picked up in temptation.
It all works, and it isn‚Äôt hard to see how this plays out in other aspects of our lives, too.
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a binge eater. You‚Äôve thought about your problem and discovered that it occurs later in the night. When you‚Äôre feeling distracted, you find yourself looking through the fridge and picking up a ready-made snack before going back to doing what you have to do.
If you are serious about cutting the habit, there‚Äôs an easy solution. Stop buying ready-made food. That‚Äôs the negative influence. The 5-minute detour you routinely make won‚Äôt be long enough to cook from scratch, and it‚Äôll force you to find another outlet. Maybe a healthier one.
If you‚Äôre diligent in recognizing the root cause of your bad behavior and the harmful influence responsible for it, you can simply eliminate or substitute it from your surroundings.
When it comes to change, people have a tendency to be drastic in their goals and their expectations. Thinking big is often needed to fuel inspiration, but it isn‚Äôt the best way to build momentum. The only way to do that is to break things down and start small.
It‚Äôs hard to get a behavior to stick. When it‚Äôs new, it isn‚Äôt automated, and to make it last, we need a high dose of motivation to follow through. Now, if motivation came easy, that wouldn‚Äôt pose much of a challenge, but as most of us can attest, that isn‚Äôt how it works.
In 2003, Eric J. Johnson and Daniel Goldstein published a now-famous paper in Science, one of the top academic journals in the world, titled Do Defaults Save Lives? Their aim was to show the effects of default choice on organ donation rates in different countries.
At the time, approximately 85% of people in the US approved of organ donation, and yet, only 28% of people were signed up as donors. They observed a similar trend in countries like Germany and Spain. On the other side of the coin, places like Austria, France, and Portugal had donation consent rates higher than 99%. That‚Äôs a massive difference.
They had an opt-out system of consent as opposed to an opt-in system. Rather than people having to go out of their way to sign up for an organ donation, they were automatically signed up as donors, but with the option to take themselves off if they disapproved of the process. Almost no one did, and it saved thousands, if not millions, of lives.
Depending on the degree of convenience, people showed a vast difference in whether or not they acted consistently with their beliefs. Making it easy changed everything.
In your own life, if you‚Äôre having trouble taking a necessary prescription drug that you‚Äôve been assigned, don‚Äôt leave it in your drawer or a corner somewhere, hoping you don‚Äôt forget. That‚Äôs far too difficult. Put it squarely on top of your phone at night. When you wake up in the morning and reach for that phone, you‚Äôll also be reminded to take a dose of those pills.
That‚Äôs one example in one part of your life. These small changes add up to produce big results.
The difficulty in eliminating a bad behavior is that it‚Äôs often a habit, and the difficulty in inspiring a new desired behavior is that it often isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a connection there, and it‚Äôs been studied and written about extensively in the last few decades.
Habits are behaviors that occur repeatedly and without conscious effort. They‚Äôre a product of an efficiently evolved brain, and they‚Äôre responsible for up to 40% of our daily actions.
The thing that makes habits both dangerous and desirable is the fact that they take very little effort. They rely on a trigger to send them into a routine that leads to a form of reward.
It‚Äôs a tried and tested three-step process that can be used to design new habits, but alone, it still requires a heavy dose of motivation. That said, if we take it a step further, we can bypass this by building useful constraints into our environment. Let‚Äôs go back to Hong Kong.
The constraint in Hong Kong isn‚Äôt one that was intentionally designed by its inhabitants, but deliberate or not, it gives us an idea of how restrictions can direct and automate behavior.
The limitation of a cramped apartment is undesirable. It feels isolating, and that‚Äôs the initial trigger. It provides the person with an incentive to minimize the time they spend there.
What do they do? They become proactive. They call their friends, they look to see if any events are going on, and they seek out any excuse to be elsewhere. That‚Äôs the routine.
The reward is socialization. Because everyone else appears to feel the same way, they‚Äôre all looking to get out and do something fun, so that‚Äôs what they do. With time and repetition, it‚Äôs something they come to expect. They no longer need to be proactive. It‚Äôs a desired habit.
Most tactics for habit formation rely on deliberately designing the habit loop into our lives. With the right knowledge and motivation, it works. The problem is that it takes a considerable amount of effort and willpower to follow through until the automation process takes hold.
The more optimal method is to automate the automation process. By harnessing the power of constraints, you can place levers in your environment to guide your behavior in the direction you want without even thinking about it.
Change is hard. It requires you to be deliberate in your focus towards your goals. Even then, without the right tactics, such efforts can be pointless. Motivation and willpower aren‚Äôt easy to harness, and between the demands of day to day life, they can be difficult to spare.
One of the most effective ways to change your life is by lowering the barrier of motivation and willpower that‚Äôs required. That‚Äôs where environment design comes in. It‚Äôs the hidden force that guides much of human behavior.
Of course, productive behavior change doesn‚Äôt come without a battle. Even with informed knowledge on how it can be better accomplished, there‚Äôs more than one hurdle. The hurdle of commitment, the hurdle of compromise, and the hurdle of action. But it can be done.
A lot of what we attribute to luck is a product of environment. Good thing is that you can change it.

What does a typical day in your life look like?  The first thing I do is I keep a list of all the tasks I want to do that day. I‚Äôm trying the Pomodoro technique, which really helps with being efficient. It‚Äôs tricky in the office, because I share the office with two other people, and sometimes they can talk to you, so I have to put on a hat or something to warn them ‚ÄòI‚Äôm in Pomodoro time; don‚Äôt disturb me for twenty minutes.‚Äô
I‚Äôve been trying that for six months and my other colleague also is doing it, so the third one gets a bit pissed off because we always have these hats on. So it‚Äôs trying to prepare ‚Äòwhat are the things that I must complete today,‚Äô and those that are nice to have, and that‚Äôs how I organize it. I try to block some time off without calls. My day is pretty much looking for customers I can talk to for my next interviews and customer engagements, so a lot of emailing and scheduling those, and then preparing for those interviews. Preparing the protocols, the questionnaires, and how I can best use the time with them. Lately I‚Äôve been doing a lot of transcription after those interviews.  When I have a couple of these calls I‚Äôll try to drag one of my colleagues along to help me take notes in Airtable. And then I start analyzing the data. Sometimes I‚Äôm jumping into brainstorming sessions with my colleagues on site, or remotely; my team is located all around the world.
I know you focus a lot on research ‚Äî what is the composition of your team like? What other roles are there on your team? I‚Äôm the only one who is a researcher on this project, per se. The rest are interaction designers and user experience designers, UX architects. That‚Äôs the core of the XD team. Then there are the rest of the managers on the team, who I talk to a lot as well to define what I focus on next, and then there are the scrum teams. I share the information, findings and everything with them, but the experience designers are the actual interaction designers on those scrum teams. What are some of the tools you use to get work done?  I use Mural, which is like a virtual board where I can put sticky notes and collaborate with my teammates. I used to use a lot of illustrator, but not so much now. Pen and paper; sketching a lot. A lot of PowerPoint. Do you have any specific workflow tips for how to do your job better? Are there any common mistakes that you see new people in your field make? One of the key things that kills me is people jumping into creating a final solution before they even understand the problem. When you‚Äôre a researcher, that‚Äôs something that hurts a lot.
I feel that many people lack that. Have your plan there. One page. It seems silly, but often I look and am like, ‚ÄòWhy were they doing this again?‚Äô
Which books or publications do you recommend to people who want to learn more about user experience design? I receive a lot of articles, and I use Pocket ‚Äî it‚Äôs full of junk now, I bet. Just full of articles, but I don‚Äôt know where I get them! Through LinkedIn I get a lot of articles, Medium, and so on. That‚Äôs where I find a lot of tips and tricks that people share, and I can put into practice. I try to go to a couple of conference a year, and that‚Äôs where I learn a lot from what others are doing.  Which of the conferences that you‚Äôve attended have been the best?  IXDA. I went last year in Finland, and it recently happened in New York. It was good. Too big. I prefer the smaller ones, because you really get to talk to individuals more and connect.  What makes a really good user interview? Do you have any favorite questions to ask?  Always start with the structure of warmups; don‚Äôt jump straight into the core of the topic. Give a little bit of context. Just introducing myself and what my team is doing. Put them at ease, because so many people are concerned about whether they‚Äôre answering right. But there‚Äôs no right or wrong answer ‚Äî just your experience. Spending time doing that is very valuable.  Do practice interviews before you go, and have your questions ready. Do a couple of pilots before you jump into the real ones. Oh, and trying not to ask biased questions all the time.  You work on a global team, and you‚Äôre based in Switzerland, and you interview people from around the world ‚Äî how do you think about getting things done and working with people from all around the world? What are some of the challenges that you face with that, and some of the cool things that come out of that as well?  Well the obvious challenge is the time zone. It‚Äôs really tricky to get some areas. The language barrier is always; when I try to do interviews with people in China, for instance, it‚Äôs really complicated. But then it‚Äôs also a really fun experience, getting to talk to so many people from different countries, because you learn more about the stereotypes, and how often they‚Äôre true. Just very funny situations. I find that in many cases saying that I‚Äôm Spanish puts many people at ease, because they say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, English is not my first language,‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry! It‚Äôs not mine either! We‚Äôll figure it out.‚Äù  Is there a way you structure your day so you can be most effective with working with the rest of your team in other time zones?  Usually meetings start when the US wakes up, so my afternoons get busy. I try to block off as much as I can in the mornings to be meeting free and get my work done. I do all the tough scheduling and preparing for all the meetings in the afternoon, and getting the core of my job done. That‚Äôs how I organize it, basically.
How do you think about weighing all of the different elements that you get, both qualitative and quantitative, from the research that you do? How do you decide what‚Äôs most important, and which insights to pull out and share with your team? In the kind of research I‚Äôm doing right now, which is more exploratory, after talking to a lot of people I start to see the clusters of the themes that emerge. So the data that I collect tells what‚Äôs more and less relevant. People talk a lot about this topic vs that topic, etcetera.  I follow a technique called ‚ÄòRose, Bud, Thorn.‚Äô It‚Äôs a way of coding the transcript, so when you go to do interviews you code them using these three colors. Rose is pink, where you capture things that are working well. Things in green are called buds, which seem to have potential for improvement. And blue, thorns, are pain points. So I go through my notes, and I codify that based on those three aspects, and then I start grouping all of those notes by categories, by topic, so in the end I will have very different clusters with the topics, and maybe one topic is really blue, it‚Äôs very thorny, and that‚Äôs a pain point, clearly. Or an area is very green, and that means that there‚Äôs a lot of opportunity to do something about that topic.
So it‚Äôs a visual map, and it helps me share. I just capture the image, and it‚Äôs like my index. When I share, I say well, this is my findings at a glance, and from this menu of topics, which ones do you want me to talk about more, and I dig deeper.  What would you say the most important skill is for any new user experience researcher to learn? Being very curious and questioning everything. Because you might be giving a lot of direction up front; people say ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt need to find out about that, because we know about that already.‚Äô Just stay very open. Focus on what you have to find out, what the topic is, of course, but watch out for the gorillas in the room. Sometimes you might be surprised at the things you find out that are very valuable and maybe outside the scope. What do you think are some of the biggest misconceptions about user research?  One I fight with a lot is the idea that it takes time. Yes, it takes time, but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm doing a PhD. I avoid saying ‚Äòresearch‚Äô often, because it‚Äôs got kind of a bad reputation. They think ‚ÄúOh, you want to spend another six months working on that?‚Äù and it‚Äôs not. But that‚Äôs the problem with the tech world ‚Äî oh you‚Äôre on a scrum team and everything is quick, quick quick, and it‚Äôs a struggle to figure out how you fit research into that. So that‚Äôs something we have to keep on improving, to give it a better reputation.  Who are some of the members of your industry that you admire the most? Organizations that you think do user research really well? One of the ones that impacted me the most was Intuit. I heard they just grabbed all the developers, put them on a bus, and send them to the neighborhoods to talk to people. I want to do that.  What‚Äôs one niche hobby or interest that you know a lot about outside of work?  I‚Äôm into anything that has to do with autonomous vehicles, like Google cars. I‚Äôm a bit geeky on that topic.  Which is the coolest kind of autonomous vehicle?  The one that hasn‚Äôt been made yet! It‚Äôs just the possibility of creating a complete new way of personal transportation of the future.

Jeff Cunningham|187|7|https://medium.com/@cunninghamjeff/autonomy-c9c8f7424981?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|Autonomous Cars: The Good, Bad, and Ugly ‚Äì Jeff Cunningham ‚Äì Medium|"According to the U.S. Census, 130 million of us spend an hour sitting in our cars commuting to work. Every day.
That‚Äôs 130 million hours in traffic, amounting to 15,000 years of largely wasted human capital. Even if you ask people who take public transport what work they do while commuting, they say ‚Äòlisten to podcasts‚Äô.
Okay, folks.
Yet autonomous vehicles have the potential to allow us to reclaim many of those hours. Imagine, for example, that you are a working mom. You open up your autonomous vehicle app and request a ride to work. (Your employer subsidizes the cost of the service.) Five minutes later, a luxury Mercedes van pulls up. Your children pile in with you until the first stop, when they transfer to a second autonomous vehicle that takes them to school. By this time, you have solved that nagging math problem your son didn‚Äôt quite get done last night.
Now you relax, put on your headphones, and listen to Chopin. Twenty minutes later, you receive a text asking you to join a conference call. The computer screen by your chair is flashing a Powerpoint presentation. (Alas, in this particular future, we haven‚Äôt gotten rid of those.)
After the call ends, three of your coworkers climb aboard, and you resume a meeting that began yesterday. It continues until you arrive at the office. Before you leave the van, you hand in a laundry bag and a shopping list so that by the evening, the laundry is done, and the grocery bags are full. The van lets you out at the office. You take a cup of java to go.
Ask yourself, have you spent an hour commuting or have you just had the most efficient work hour of the day?
Autonomy will change the nature of where, how and when we work, and will also force us to rethink about how we spend our time. It will change the value of resources like the cost of living close to the office. Along the way, it is going to disrupt and create new industries, affect real estate values, and improve the environment.
But for our purposes, in terms of speed of adoption, it‚Äôs not coming, it‚Äôs happening now. Chief executives who haven‚Äôt thought about the reality of driverless cars because they aren‚Äôt widely deployed are making the same mistake a previous generation made when they scoffed at the idea of ubiquitous Wi-fi.
According to Internet of Things Journal, a recent study concluded the world market for automotive semiconductors will grow from $30.3 billion in 2015 to $41 billion in 2020. The markets for self-driving auto sensors and cameras are also expected to grow exponentially in just a few years.
There are no rich skeptics in Silicon Valley. This mantra is especially true of newer technologies like autonomy. Just ask anyone who invested $10,000 in Uber‚Äôs seed round when it was valued at $10 million ‚Äî and who has seen their investment grow to over $50 million. Those who scoffed are kicking themselves. Or taking taxis.
Savvy companies that get the importance of being a first mover are taking a variety of deal approaches to the autonomy sector. Some have opted for a home brew approach, like Mercedes, Uber, and Tesla, and have developed brand extensions. Others have cut billion-dollar deals to get in the game, like General Motors‚Äô recent acquisition of startup Vogt. Google built its own proprietary brand, Waymo, from scratch and recently spun it out as a separate company.
It‚Äôs happening in commercial transport, too. Uber recently launched a driverless truck division, Otto, garnering national headlines. The company completed its first test drive using driverless technologies, driving autonomously for 120 miles in Colorado with a trailer full of Budweiser.
As we said, of national importance.
Now, the government is getting in on the act.
In May 2017, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the state would start testing autonomous cars on public roads, following similar decisions in Nevada, Florida, California, and Michigan. Then, on September 6, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed the Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment in Vehicle Evolution (SELF-DRIVE) Act, which permits an increase in autonomous vehicles to 100,000 within two years from 2,500 today.
Two years from now in government time is tomorrow. Why are they moving so quickly?
First, given their dependence on technology, not human drivers, autonomous vehicles are presumed to be safer. In 2016, according to National Safety Council estimates, 40,000 Americans were killed in car accidents and there are over 100 casualties treated in an emergency room for each death, at a cost of $33 billion in 2012. Fewer accidents, injuries, and deaths would affect costs and change longevity rates ‚Äî and, consequently, the insurance and healthcare industries.
Still, self-driving vehicles aren‚Äôt accident-free, not yet anyway. Artificial intelligence will eventually allow the removal of ‚Äúsafety drivers,‚Äù but not immediately. (If you can hail an Uber self-driving car ‚Äî in Pittsburgh today, and shortly from Waymo and Cruise ‚Äî you‚Äôll notice they have ‚Äúsafety drivers‚Äù sitting in the front seat.)
Second, the government hears the call of energy conservation and climate change. Through ride sharing, we can expect to see as much as a 75 percent reduction in automobile traffic by adopting the Uber concept, and according to the Centre for Integrated Energy Research, up to a 45 percent savings in energy consumption.
The advent of driverless cars should give chief executives a rich set of opportunities to think about, but there will be many questions and no easy answers.
If your staff commutes each day, what happens with that extra hour or two? Does it belong to the employee? Does the company subsidize the car service, like Facebook and Google do in Silicon Valley? For Google, it may make sense to provide for its 72,000 employees, but what if you‚Äôre Walmart with over 2 million people who need to get to work? It changes the calculus a bit.
Does the workday itself change? Do employees even need to come to the office more than occasionally? If employees are managing their lives on their way to and from work like dropping off children at school, is the company becoming ‚Äòbig brother‚Äô? When an employee is laid off or fired, are they corporate orphans, living far from a dense city and unable to access those services? Will that turn company provided driverless transport into an entitlement like healthcare?
What about the real estate impact? Do you even need a large, flashy headquarters anymore if everyone is ride sharing to multiple locations? The chief executives I know spend less than 25% of their time at headquarters. Why waste all that space on empty offices?
Any company that relies on distribution has to consider the changes as a 100-year storm. Just imagine UPS or Amazon finding out their costs of transport go down by 40 percent, part savings on drivers (assuming Unions will cooperate) and part the maintenance free electric engines. But what of long distance carriers, railroads and airline freight shippers? Do they simply shrink like the proverbial buggy whip business?
Certain jobs will take a big hit, as well. For instance, below you will see a map showing the most common jobs by state. As you can see, the truck driver is the No1 job in America, including in two of our most populous states, California and Texas. Those are scheduled to disappear early in the era of autonomy.
Perhaps the biggest hurdle, however, is us. We will have to learn like the first time an aircraft pilot turned on the autopilot, to trust a computer to guide us through rush hour traffic at 70 mph.
There will be a litany of disruption in everything that is transported or whose business model is linked to auto usage such as car dealerships, garage mechanics, auto parts, gas stations, accident insurers, revenue from tolls and parking, rest stops and real estate relying on rush hours or short distance commuting, even policing. Police officers spend 40 percent of their day on traffic-related matters.
Parking fines will be an anachronism (New York stands to lose over half a billion a year from parking tickets). Parking lots will shut down, freeing up quite a bit of real estate, and sudden increases in capacity tend to have a negative effect on the value of inventory. In other words, more disruption for people, balance sheets, and the economy.
Autonomy will be the perfect solution for companies that see far ahead, understand technology and make preliminary and smart investments. But it will be the perfect storm for those who hang on to the status quo and wait for the changes to come to them.

Ryan Peck|30|7|https://medium.com/thrive-global/12-essential-habits-you-must-include-in-your-daily-routine-988e6539d9c0?source=tag_archive---------7---------------------|12 Essential Habits You Must Include In Your Daily Routine|"Habits can either ‚Äòmake or break‚Äô us in our lives. They can either assist us towards success, or can be a hindrance and drag us towards failure. Habits, whether good or bad, are unavoidable and are a part of our all our lives. They can ultimately have the power to shape our lives, and are a big part of who we are.
Establishing good habits is no easy task, not even for the very successful. The struggle is real when it comes finding ways to make good habits become part of our routine. Being proactive and consciously trying to build good habits is extremely important.
Focusing on becoming proactive instead of reactive will increase our chances creating good habits. It‚Äôs better to make goals for positive habits, rather than to try and eliminate our routines with bad habits.
What good habits should we be proactive in trying to create?
Establishing good habits is a positive thing, no matter what they are. Eliminating the bad ones are also very beneficial. However, focus your efforts in establishing these 12 habits into your daily routine, and you will feel invigorated, strengthened, and ready to take on the world.
1) Be Positive.
Negative thoughts never feel good, and never leads to happiness. On the other hand, positive thoughts do feel good and will lead to a higher state of happiness. The mind is a powerful thing, and we can master it to allow us to accomplish more in life.
As we become more positive, we will feel more control over our emotions. We will argue less, love more, see the light in all things, and live life in a happier state. This will allow us to become better entrepreneurs, parents, spouses, friends, and people.
2) Be Thankful.
Being thankful needs to be a daily thing, and not just when it‚Äôs Thanksgiving. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in all the negativity and focus on what we don‚Äôt have in life. However, as we focus on what we do have, it starts to make life much more enjoyable. Being thankful will not only make us feel better, but is actually good for our health.
At the end of each night, repeat out loud three things in which you are thankful for. This will force your mind and flood it with positive thoughts, which will then lead you to a happier state as you go to bed. My wife and I have been doing this for the last few years, and it‚Äôs become one of the better pats of my day.
3) Have Charity.
Charity is a powerful thing. It‚Äôs actually pretty contagious. The interesting thing about charity is typically the person who benefits the most, is actually the person giving it. Charity does something to us, it invokes emotions and makes us feel as if we are on could 9. It automatically boosts our morale, and strengthens our emotional well-being. We tend to view the world in a better light when we are in a charitable mood. Charity is not only serving others, but it encompasses patience, kindness, love, and loyalty. . Striving to be charitable each and every day is hard, but the positive benefits will pay off exponentially for both you and those which you help.
4) Smile.
Science has proven that smiling creates endorphins. Each time we smile our neurotransmitters release the endorphins throughout our body. Endorphins are proven to help relieve pain and induce feelings of pleasure and euphoria. It‚Äôs quite simple, the more we smile, the happier our state of mind will be.
5) Get Organized.
If you‚Äôre an entrepreneur, then your life is probably going 100 different directions. You have the bills to think about, your company, your family, social life, your image, and a ton of other things. Your life is getting pulled in so many directions at the exact same time.
Take 5 minutes each morning, and organize yourself for the rest of the day. Make a detailed list of what you need to accomplish, and list them in order of relevance. By doing this, you will learn to organize your days better, which will not only allow you to accomplish more, but it will ease the stress of feeling like your in so many directions.
6) Wake up early
A Biologist from Harvard found that early risers are more proactive during the day.
Waking up early is proven to enhance ones productivity. There are less distractions in the morning, therefore allowing you to accomplish more. Arising early has proven to aid us in being more optimistic, positive, and upbeat. Establishing a habit of waking up early will ultimately allow your days to be more meaningful than when waking up late.
7) Go to bed early
Science has proven that more rest helps lead to better brain functions and being more alert. Going to bed early allows us to rest both physically and mentally, which helps us get the recharge we need for the next day. Studies claim that proper sleep also aids in weight loss as well as strengthens our immune system. Experts say we should ultimately aim to get between seven-eight hours of rest each night. Avoiding distractions like browsing our digital devices in bed will allow our minds to wind down and fall asleep easier.
8) Exercise
Everyone knows that exercising is essential for maintaining a good weight, and improves our physical health. However, people don‚Äôt realize the powerful effect that exercising has on our emotional well being. Josh Steimle, a renowned speaker, writer, and entrepreneur, wrote an article titled ‚ÄúWhy Exercising Is a Higher Priority Than My Business‚Äù.
Josh states ‚Äúwhen I exercise, that makes me better in every role I have, whether it‚Äôs as a husband, father, friend or entrepreneur. If I were to stop exercising because I felt that being a good business owner was a higher priority, then ironically I would end up a worse business owner than I was when it was a lower priority‚Äù.
When we get in a solid exercise routine every day, we will see ourselves become better entrepreneurs, parents, spouses, and friends.
9) Serve others
Serving others aids to our happiness. A team of sociologists tracked 2000 people over a five year period and found that those who identified as ‚Äúvery happy‚Äù volunteered at least 5.8 hours per month. Other studies have shown that those who give back and serve others will have a higher sense of happiness, health, and sense of well-being. Helping others can be done in a variety of ways, we just need to look for opportunities to serve others.
10) Set goals
Goals are created with the purpose of helping us achieve more in life, whatever it may be. We need to constantly set goals if we want to continue to progress and accomplish more. If we are not setting goals, that means we are not striving to progress, which means we will most likely not accomplish any more tomorrow than we did today. We need to create daily goals, weekly goals, and monthly goals. Our daily goals need to support with our weekly goals, and our weekly goals need support our monthly goals. Ultimately, this is the secret to becoming better today than we were yesterday, and becoming even better tomorrow than we were today.
11) Focus
The world hasn‚Äôt ever had so many distractions as it does today. Today our focus competes with Facebook, snap chat, Instagram, ESPN, Bleacher Report, work, family, Netflix, TV, and so much more. We are constantly trying to do too many things at the same time, ultimately not allowing us to fully invest ourselves into one task. Multi-tasking is not a bad thing, but we need to make sure we give the proper things our full commitment and focus.
How many companies are you trying to start? How many ideas are you trying to experiment with? How many diets are you trying to do? How many TV shows are you trying to watch? How many people are you trying to date? We are never going to be successful with anything we do as long as we are sharing our time. Focus on the task at hand 100%, once completed, move on to the next task. It‚Äôs better to be 100% successful with one thing, rather than 5% successful with 20 different things. When you are in the office, focus on being in the office. When you are with your family, focus on being with your family. When you are at school, focus on being at school. Learn how to focus your time on one thing at a time and watch your results take off like never before.
12) Live In ‚ÄúThe Now‚Äù
Living in ‚Äúthe now‚Äù means to live and love the present moment. How many times do we not enjoy the true pleasures right in front of us because our minds are distracted with thinking of either the past or the future. Time is something we cannot control, and whatever we are enjoying at the moment will eventually come to an end. We must learn to enjoy the present day, the present moment, the present opportunity, and love it. If we are always thinking about what may come tomorrow, we are going to have a lot of failed today‚Äôs. Learn to live in ‚Äòthe now‚Äô, and your emotional well being and productivity will sky rocket.
Bringing It All Together
By being proactive and establishing these essential good habits, you will lift your emotional well-being, raise your happiness, and skyrocket your productivity and love for life.

John Lafleur|20K|8|https://hackernoon.com/top-12-things-that-destroy-developer-productivity-2ddf0abc190?source=tag_archive---------8---------------------|Top 12 Things That Destroy Developer Productivity ‚Äì Hacker Noon|"A lot of articles address the role of tech leads and engineering managers. One common theme we often come across is how to increase a team‚Äôs productivity. But before you focus your energy trying to increase their productivity, you might first want to consider what‚Äôs destroying it, to have a sound base on which you can build. Unfortunately, even though Peopleware was published almost 30 years ago, we see lots of teams suffering from huge productivity loss in some (negatively) remarkable ways!
No one expects a programmer to get work done without access to a computer, but there are many companies that expect programmers to get work done without access to their mind. This is equally unrealistic.
So let‚Äôs deep dive into our list of 12 things that prevent your developers from getting ‚Äúinto the zone‚Äù and being productive. I will try to prioritize this list from most to least impactful. Feel free to comment!
If you‚Äôre wondering if all this is worth the investment, just consider the developer‚Äôs salaries. Even 10% more productivity is a LOT!
Interruptions are the top productivity killer for developers, in my mind. Developers can‚Äôt easily go back to where they were right before an interruption. They need to get into the mindset for development and then slowly trace back to where they left off. This can easily take more than 30 minutes. And the more interruptions, the more frustration, the less quality work, the more bugs ‚Äî and it goes on.
What about meetings? The only difference between a meeting and an interruption is that a meeting is a planned interruption, which makes it even worse. Developers can‚Äôt progress on a task if they know that they will have an interruption while working on it. So if they have a meeting in one or two hours, they will not be able to progress on anything, as most engineering tasks take more time.
How can this be avoided? This part is well documented; you have no excuse. Hold short status meetings at the very start of the day or just before lunch, for example, to avoid unnecessary interruptions.
Of the different types of managers, micro-managers might be the worst in terms of the developers‚Äô productivity. Sure, micro-managers tend to have more meetings and unplanned interruptions. But it‚Äôs not only that. They show a lack of trust, and by doing so, you feel they constantly undermine your skills and your ability to get things done. Any motivation a developer had between interruptions will be just gone at that point. The impact goes beyond productivity. Micro-managers might be the first reason for developers to leave, or at the very least, to change teams.
There are many ways to illustrate vagueness. Bug reports like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs broken, fix it!‚Äù don‚Äôt have enough information for developers to work off of. By the way, having a bug report template can help in that case.
Or unclear specification on a feature, in which case developers will start implementing what feels right to them, before they have to start again from scratch once the manager better details the expected behavior.
Unclear prioritization also belongs in this category. The time that a developer spends wondering if they are working on the right task can so easily be avoided. And if ever they get a comment from the manager asking why they worked on this particular task (while priorities were not defined)...well, you get it ‚Äî a lot of frustration...
Have you ever heard of it? It happens when managers are totally uninvolved in the work, but... they just swoop down once in a while to shit all over everything. ‚ÄúThis is wrong, and this, and this looks bad,‚Äù etc., before flying away again. I have to admit I loved the image, but unfortunately, this happens more often than we would like it to. This behavior is deeply frustrating to developers; they won‚Äôt be able to get back in the zone in the next few hours, and sometimes not even for days.
Have you ever had a manager or other developer who took all the credit for the work you have done in the past weeks? Developers value competence above all. Taking the credit for someone else is taking the other‚Äôs competence for yourself and removing it from him or her. This is pretty high up on my list, as I feel it creates so much tension that it just destroys the whole developers‚Äô productivity for quite a while.
This might seem strange to non-programmers, but the environment in which developers work has an important impact on their activities. For instance, having some white noise ‚Äî loud AC, hearing cars and trucks roll by ‚Äî helps them focus better. That‚Äôs why so many of us put headsets on! I actually just discovered RainyMood ‚Äî really great üëç!
Similarly, if the workspace is designed to have as much motion as possible, that won‚Äôt help them focus! Or having the desktop computer screens oriented in such a way that they are highly visible to the managers...well, that creates some extra stress and even more opportunities to be interrupted.
Scope creep (also called focus creep, requirement creep, feature creep, and sometimes kitchen sink syndrome) in project management refers to uncontrolled changes in a project‚Äôs scope. This can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled.
Scope creep turns relatively simple requests into horribly complex and time-consuming monsters! And most of the time it happens during development! For instance, for a simple feature: Version 1 (before implementation): feature is ‚ÄúShow a map of the location‚Äù Version 2 (when version 1 almost finished): feature is changed to ‚ÄúShow a 3D map of the location‚Äù Version 3 (when version 2 almost finished): feature again changed to ‚ÄúShow a 3D map of the location that the user can fly through‚Äù
So this one might seem strange at first glance, but is actually pretty easy to understand. If a product team defines its team‚Äôs priorities without ever validating (through customer feedback or any other means) the interest of the corresponding features, and the developers see that most features are eventually just not used, they will feel that what they do is useless and will lose their motivation. We all want to feel impactful, and that may be even more important to developers!
Technical debt is a deliberate decision to implement not-the-best solution or write not-the-best code to release software faster. Taking on some technical debt is inevitable and can increase speed in software development in the short run. However, in the long run, it contributes to system complexity, which slows the developers down. Non-programmers often underestimate the loss of productivity and are tempted to always move forward, and that becomes an issue. But if refactoring is never part of the priorities, it will not only impact productivity but also product quality.
Developers use many tools to program, push and merge their code every day. The more automation, the better. It goes without saying that if you use ‚Äúancient‚Äù tools, this will impact your productivity. Similarly, having a big screen vs only a laptop can have an impact. Given the cost of hardware and the developer‚Äôs salary, having just a 5% productivity gain is definitely worth any investment on that point! Just give the tools and hardware that your developer team prefers (individually for hardware, but as a group for the tools).
When learning how to code, we were told to comment early and often. The idea is that it‚Äôs better to have too many comments than to have too few. Unfortunately, many programmers incorrectly interpret this to mean that they must comment every single line of code, which is why we often see code like this (from Jeff Atwood‚Äôs post on ‚ÄúCoding Without Comments‚Äù):
Do you have any idea what this code does? Me neither. The problem is that while there are plenty of comments describing what the code is doing, there are none describing why it‚Äôs doing it. If there were a bug in the program and you stumbled across this code, you wouldn‚Äôt know where to begin.
This last one is linked to the tendency of managers to ask developers for estimates, then push them to lower those estimates as much as possible, and then magically consider them as deadlines! Managers will even consider that, as the developers themselves ‚Äúdecided‚Äù on the estimate, they committed to the deadlines, and therefore the deadlines should be considered valid enough to be shared to upper management.
Not surprisingly, developers feel that those deadlines are unreasonable and arbitrarily tight; this creates tension and an inability to focus.
How are all those things unique to developers? If you look at all 12 things, they are actually pretty common to most other project-based jobs. It‚Äôs just that the impact of each of these is even more important for developers, as they need deep focus to progress on their tasks.
If you recognize some points mentioned above within your company, it might be interesting to address them with your developers. Talk to them; find out if these are an issue and how it can be resolved. Whatever they say, the most important thing is to trust their feedback and insights. And while today‚Äôs technology is very different from 30 years ago, the lesson is still the same. You can‚Äôt ignore the human factor when you consider team productivity. Iterate on your processes, environment and work habits with your team, and let them guide you on how to have the highest productivity and impact.

But sometimes when we are looking for a solution, it can be a limited resource. I‚Äôm always looking for ways to work smarter, not harder.
What if I could come up with answers in my sleep? I discovered that it‚Äôs possible to do just that.
To the outsider, it can look as if someone were literally dreaming up solutions to situations. What‚Äôs really happening, though, is that a person who is skilled at this is first removing their overeager conscious mind temporarily from the equation, and then mobilizing the power of their subconscious minds through the power of a specific question.
It‚Äôs not half as complicated as that last sentence suggests. Questions are the key. I learned how to make this work for me, and I‚Äôll show you how to do it, too.
To understand better how the mind works, we‚Äôre going to look at an analogy from science fiction: the Starship Enterprise from Star Trek‚Äîpartly for it‚Äôs shape, and partly for the the way the different departments interact.
The ‚Äúbridge‚Äù of the ship is the place where most of the action appears to happen‚Äîit‚Äôs the control center. Captain Kirk stands manfully on the bridge of the Enterprise, making decisions and giving orders‚Äîwith an ego the size of a nearby planet.
Captain Kirk is, in fact, the perfect example of ‚Äòego‚Äô from the point of view of psychology or personal development: he‚Äôs our self concept or the representation of the constructed self.
The Oxford dictionary defines ego as ‚Äúthe part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a sense of personal identity.‚Äù
Despite what he gets up to in the series, Captain Kirk‚Äôs job is to ensure the success of his mission and the continual wellbeing of his crew and ship. It is up to him to receive and evaluate information, weigh options, and decide on the best course of action.
Our conscious brain work is like our own ‚ÄòCaptain Kirk‚Äô, standing on the bridge of our mind, taking control and trying to make all the decisions. Any problems or situations to be reviewed come here first to the bridge, and our conscious mind is very good at making those decisions.
However, like Captain Kirk, our ego can be a little too full of its own importance and overeagerness to solve issues. It often doesn‚Äôt notice all the possible solutions, or make use of resources better suited to finding those solutions.
The bridge is only a small part of The Enterprise, however. Supporting everything happening on the bridge is engineering. The bridge and Captain Kirk may look like the center, but without engineering, no one‚Äôs going anywhere. Engineering is where the warp engines lay, and where all the data is stored from every mission and available databank.
The WILL to boldly go may be on the bridge of the ship, but the POWER to get there is in the engineering bay.
The engines and the supercomputers in engineering never stop, never sleep‚Äîunlike Captain Kirk. They receive instructions, then keep processing and working away until a solution is found.
In The Enterprise of our mind, the engineering bay is our subconscious mind. Always processing, it doesn‚Äôt sleep like the conscious mind.
Max Maltz likens the subconscious mind to a supercomputer or autoserver mechanism in his work (and subsequent book), Psycho Cybernetics. Maltz originally published this back in 1960, but his methods and ideas are still prevalent, and relevant, today. You can see the influence of his work in that of thought leaders such as Zig Ziglar, Tony Robbins, and Benjamin P. Hardy.
He explains that in the same way that a machine does not reason or judge, rather it just follows the task set it, so does the subconscious mind.
A really simple example of this is when you‚Äôre trying to remember someone‚Äôs name. It bugs us, doesn‚Äôt it? The simple question of ‚Äúwhat is their name?‚Äù is sent back from the conscious to the subconscious mind, where our search engine works away until three hours later, while washing up, we think ‚ÄúJane!‚Äù
The original situation has passed, but the subconscious ‚Äúengineering‚Äù has been working away to find an answer while our conscious mind has been doing other things. Now while we‚Äôre doing something that doesn‚Äôt involve high levels of brain power, the message can get through, ‚ÄúHey, you on the bridge: Jane!‚Äù
Another example of the play between conscious and subconscious is how they work together when we need to make a decision. For example, let‚Äôs say I want to buy new shoes.
As I go about my daily tasks, I now start noticing people‚Äôs shoes. The file is still open on ‚ÄòWhich shoes do I buy?‚Äô so my data collection devices (eyes and ears) send information back into the control center (conscious mind) which does a quick evaluation (horrible color/looks comfy).
Did I notice people‚Äôs shoes before? Not really.
Were people wearing shoes before that? Of course! I just didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúscan and search‚Äù order set for ‚Äúshoes‚Äù.
Buying shoes is a simple example, but the same principle is in action if we want to change our job, find a course, meet a new partner, or discover a way to change an area of our lives. We can set an order to search and scan. The data comes in, and the amazingly powerful subconscious connects and compiles it, even when we are not consciously thinking about it.
We know that asking the right questions are the key, and that we need to get the Captain Kirk of our ego to release its hold on the situation and take a break.
So now we can look at how to practically do that and set up our brains for finding creative solutions and success.
Questions are the key. A question is better than an opinion or affirmation for finding creative solutions. Positive affirmations can be very effective for changing the programing in our subconscious, but it doesn‚Äôt send the command to do anything: to search and connect.
I‚Äôve been consistently working on this idea of setting my subconscious a question for nearly a year and I have noticed differences in my results. Here is what I‚Äôve learned, through trial and error, and some corresponding research.
Good questions invite action and expansion. The subconscious loves making connections and having something to do, and it loves good questions.
Secondly, the focus of the question makes a difference. A big difference.
If I send the question ‚Äòhow can I feel less tired all the time?‚Äô it‚Äôs a negative question. The focus is on feeling tired, so that‚Äôs what you are telling your computer to focus on. The resulting thoughts and feelings will reflect this focus. ‚ÄòTired‚Äô in, ‚Äòtired‚Äô out.
By rephrasing the question to: ‚ÄòHow can I re-energize myself this week?‚Äô the focus is positive, on energy and feeling energized, and the results will follow suite. By setting a specific time frame of this week or tomorrow, you are also setting nice manageable parameters for your subconscious to play with.
I found that it was worth spending a little time phrasing my questions so they were positive and specific. The five or ten minutes I spent weighing the question until it felt right and in line with what I wanted was worth it in results.
When we hold on to our issues in our conscious mind, it can cause stress and frustration. It‚Äôs not surprising really: it needs options and space with which to consider decisions or have that insight.
Essentially, you need to take a break! It might sounds surprising to say that to find the solution, you should stop consciously working on it. Remember: Archimedes didn‚Äôt have his ‚ÄòEureka‚Äô moment until he had his bath.
Sherlock Holmes, although a fictional character, would play chess or the violin when wanting the answer to something that had him stumped. I wonder how many times Arthur Conan Doyle did something similar as he allowed his mind to percolate his stories and ideas?
Personally, I find taking a break allows me release the build up of pressure in my thoughts, meaning that the only headbanging that I do is to music.
Take a break to be more productive.
It is an effective short term solution. It gives ‚Äòengineering‚Äô time to sort through data and make connections, send the results back up to the bridge and ... ‚ÄòEureka!‚Äô
Thomas Edison would regularly take a nap when faced with a problem. He is famous for taking a nap in his chair while holding two metal balls in his hands, which would drop and wake him if he fell into a deep sleep. The answer or insight would often be there upon waking.
Albert Einstein and Nikola Tesla were also famous for their napping habits.
Did you know that famous British prime minister Winston Churchill had a bed in the Houses of Parliament, and was convinced that his regular siestas and power naps were part of the success of his governing?
I used to laugh at the idea of a power nap‚Äîthey‚Äôre for grannies, right? But I found I was wrong and that sometimes a brief bit of downtime refreshes my energy levels, and allows my subconscious mind to shine. The subconscious doesn‚Äôt sleep, remember, so a brief bit of shut eye effectively releases my conscious mind‚Äôs hold on a subject so that ‚Äòengineering‚Äô can do what it does best.
Napping is good, but what I find to be most effective is to ask a question at night, right before sleeping.
In bed, nice and relaxed, I like to review my day and send a question to my subconscious to play with while I recharge my batteries.
I‚Äôm literally working in my sleep.
One article on neural plasticity published in the ‚ÄòFrontiers in Neural Circuits‚Äô journal explains that ‚Äî
Edison is said to never have gone to sleep without first setting his mind a question. Those patterns mentioned in the article are what give us the solutions and insights the next morning.
Writing the question down before sleep helps me twofold.
It helps me to think about, and carefully form, the best question to give me the best answer. It also reminds me in the morning what I‚Äôd asked.
Writing it down at night to review the next day keeps me on track.
This has become a part of my nightly routine‚Äîa sort of mental hygiene. In the same way that I brush my teeth at night as part of my dental health, I also review my three wins and set my question in my journal as part of my mental health.
The technique of setting your question at night before sleep works really well in conjunction with morning journaling.
I‚Äôm not talking about the ‚Äòwhat I had for breakfast and my back aches‚Äô type of journaling, but rather a form of writing where we move ourselves into a peak state of focus and set our most valuable priorities for our day, sculpting our future before it happens.
Some use the habit of ‚Äòmorning pages‚Äô, where they brain-dump, first thing in the morning, as they write without specifically filtering ideas. Nedd Herrmann in his work on brain waves confirmed that there is something special about capturing your mental state upon first waking:
‚ÄúDuring this awakening cycle it is possible for individuals to stay in the theta state for an extended period of say, five to 15 minutes ‚Äî which would allow them to have a free flow of ideas about yesterday‚Äôs events or to contemplate the activities of the forthcoming day. This time can be extremely productive and can be a period of very meaningful and creative mental activity.‚Äù
This creativity is vital. It allows us to think from a different perspective and see what we couldn‚Äôt see before.
Don‚Äôt make the mistake of thinking that writing morning pages is just for, say, creative writers. It can be used by anyone wanting to access their full range of brain power.
Our mind is amazing. What I see in my personal experience and research on this topic is that it is possible to maximize our potential and productivity through a simple habit.
Promoting greater balance and cohesion in my mind is important to me, as is working smarter‚Äînot just harder‚Äîto create what I want.
I‚Äôm no Einstein or Churchill, but by emulating their habits, I can better my own, and then let those habits improve my life. I also have less headaches now, and I‚Äôm having fun playing with this simple technique to increase my creativity, insight, and productivity.
After all, that‚Äôs not something that I‚Äôm going to lose any sleep over, right?

10,000 hours of deliberate practice is the amount of time it takes to be a top performer in a highly competitive field, according to Malcolm Gladwell in his book, Outliers.
In the past 13 months, I‚Äôve proven time and again that you can learn valuable soft and hard skills in about 15 to 20 hours of practice. And I‚Äôm talking about starting from nothing. I‚Äôve learned 39 new skills in the past 13 months. But I‚Äôm not the only one who has experimented with that. My original inspiration came from Josh Kaufman‚Äôs TEDx talk, The First 20 Hours ‚Äî How to Learn Anything.
Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Barack Obama, Oprah, and many more top performers dedicate a lot of their time to learning a variety of skills that allowed them to be where they are today. All of them have achieved much because of what they‚Äôve learned and what they know. They are not more intelligent, they just dedicate more of their time on learning most valuable skills.
I was very careful in choosing skills that are as applicable today as they will be 100 years from now. In fact, the skills that follow were useful or would have been useful thousands of years ago as well.
Each of these skills can be learned to a level in which you can be good enough in it in under 8 hours of practice ‚Äî one full work day!
But be careful, practicing any skill for long hours will not yield the results you expect. Your brain doesn‚Äôt assimilate new knowledge that way.
The first skill in the list is the basis of every other skill you‚Äôre going to learn for the rest of your life. It‚Äôs no surprise then that I listed it as the #1 skill to learn to thrive in 2019 in my highest performing article yet.
Do you want to change your life forever?
Start with the following skills, in no particular order, with the exception of the first one:
When I started my journey to learning, I was slightly disorganized and didn‚Äôt fully understand what I was getting into. With practice, I understood the importance of knowing how our brain truly works. Today, learning anything new isn‚Äôt as hard as it used to be.
Just this month, I‚Äôm learning how to write a book in Spanish, composing epic music (starting from zero knowledge in music), developing backends in the Go language, and salsa dancing (again, starting from zero knowledge of dancing).
If that sounds overwhelming to you, it should, at least for now.
And it may seem to you that I‚Äôm spending 100% of my time learning these skills, but the truth is that I‚Äôm only just practicing 30 minutes each every day. In 15 hours of deliberate practice, I‚Äôll be able to do each of these where I‚Äôll be confident enough to say I‚Äôve acquired a skill.
The reason I‚Äôm able to do that is that I‚Äôve learned to learn. While that obviously comes with practice, here‚Äôs how you can do this too:
It would take a whole book to teach you how to learn to learn. To keep this article at a respectable length, I‚Äôll refer you to this other story I wrote which details the keys aspects of learning to learn:
The first 8 hours:
Watch 30 minutes of the Learning to Learn class on 2x speed for 16 days.
Learning new skills increases your motivation, makes you more adaptable, relatable, interesting and helps you get better jobs and earn more money.
Just yesterday, I led a workshop where every member learned to create their own online store and made money on that very same day! Who would have thought that it‚Äôs something I would have taught someday in my life!
But it‚Äôs not just me. One of the most inspiring members of my SkillUp your Life program, Prithviraj, learned to swim and that led to him getting a new awesome job, greatly increasing his salary and improving the lives of his parents and other people surrounding him.

I never aimed to write. If you asked me just a year ago what I thought about writing, I‚Äôd tell you it‚Äôs not for me. I‚Äôm a programmer. I code and I love it.
But then in January of 2018, I decided that I should improve my writing skills, simply because it‚Äôs one of our most powerful method of communication and it‚Äôs valuable both in life and in business.
After 5 days of writing, I got published by The Startup. 23 days later, I became a top writer in 7 categories. I received incredible comments from my reader and really started to enjoy it.
I always meant to stop after 30 days of practice but with all the momentum I had going, I had to keep going. So here I am writing this piece 10 months after I wrote my first piece on Medium.com.
Like any skill, you learn by doing. But here‚Äôs a trick most people don‚Äôt do: write publicly.
You learn better when people can actually see your work. It forces you to dig deeper and do your very best. It gives you accountability. You get feedback from others and improved based on it.
Create a blog and publish regularly and consistently. Try publishing once a day on Medium, even when you‚Äôre not satisfied with your results. People don‚Äôt have to read it.
No need to write a crazy amount every day. Start small. MR. Molly Maguire started with one sentence a day and now writes complete blog posts.
The first 8 hours:
Write 300 words a day in 30‚Äì45 minutes in 12‚Äì16 days and publish on Medium.com or your own blog.
Writing helps you define your voice. It helps you get clarity on who you are and who you want to become.
Little did I know that my stories could inspire other people, yet for the past 10 months, I‚Äôve been a top writer in inspiration, currently ranking #5.
Your story is your story alone. It has the power to change both your life and that of others.
You learn to become a better storyteller, which is a crucial skill both life and business.

A lot of what I know today about writing on Medium.com, I learned from these awesome writers: Dave Schools, Tom Kuegler and Anthony Moore.
As a shy introvert, I‚Äôve never really wanted to do any public speaking. In school, to get me out of the shyness, I‚Äôd act out some confidence in front of the class. It worked pretty well.
It‚Äôs actually I technique I still use. Whenever I do a presentation in front of an audience, I picture myself in the shoes of Tony Robbins.
Isn‚Äôt there anyone more comfortable in front of a large audience than Tony Robbins?
Before writing in January, I picked up Storytelling and Public Speaking as two of the skills I would practice for the month. Little did I know that both these skills would become valuable in my writing after.
Seek opportunities to speak in front of groups.
Start with people you‚Äôre comfortable with, like your friends and family. Talk about subjects you‚Äôre really passionate about. When you talk about things you love, around people you love, the nervousness doesn‚Äôt kick in.
Recognize that the first time you tell a story, it won‚Äôt be perfect. Take notes of people‚Äôs non-verbal reactions. Notice people‚Äôs interest level with each sentence you say.
Public speaking is all about refining your stories.
When ready, attend Toastmasters events. Do talks at your workplace. Do a TEDx talk. Sky‚Äôs the limit!
The first 8 hours:
Attend and participate in one 1‚Äì2 Toastmasters event (or similar) every week for 4‚Äì8 weeks.
In High Performance Habits, Brendon Burchard claims that confidence is a key ingredient in raising your clarity, necessity, energy, productivity, influence, and courage.
Nothing builds confidence more than doing a successful public speech.
Given that, the more you seek public speaking opportunities out, the more you can build your confidence.
On top of those benefits, you also improve your vocabulary and speak with greater clarity. People will understand you more when you speak.
I‚Äôve definitely experienced the results explained by Burchard and his team by performing more public speeches, and so can you!

Meditation is one of those skills, like drawing, that I thought I would never be able to learn.
The problem back then is that I didn‚Äôt think of meditation as a skill, meaning I didn‚Äôt think I could learn techniques to meditate well.
I had the preconception that meditation was about not thinking about anything, therefore any time I had a thought, it frustrated me.
And I know I‚Äôm not the only one who thought that way. But it‚Äôs wrong.
Back in September, I tried meditation with a friend in Cambodia and failed miserably. It took me 4 months after that attempt to finally give it a go again. Once I had the right mindset and I consistently practiced, I actually became good at it.
As a beginner, I strongly suggest guided meditation. I‚Äôll list what has been most helpful for me in the resources section below.
What‚Äôs good about guided meditation is that it teaches you that it‚Äôs okay to have thoughts and guides you through a greater clarity of mind, which is what meditation really is about.
You learn to be aware of how your body and mind feel. You learn to relax, even when you feel like you‚Äôre too nervous to relax.
What‚Äôs important that a lot of people don‚Äôt realize is that it takes time to learn it. Don‚Äôt try once and leave. Meditate at least once a day for at least 10 minutes.
You‚Äôll feel all types of emotions. In the beginning, I was bursting in laughter when instructed to count my breaths. Sometimes you‚Äôll be frustrated. No matter the emotion, don‚Äôt let it go to your head. You have control over it. The more hours of practice you put it, the easier it gets.
It‚Äôs also important that you practice where you won‚Äôt be disturbed. And as a beginner, try where there isn‚Äôt too much ambient noise. Some people will tell you to sit to meditate but I started by laying in my bed, otherwise, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable enough and concentrated on that.
So whichever pose they tell you to take, try it, but comfort is more important in my opinion, especially when learning.
The first 8 hours:
Do 20 minutes of Headspace a day for 24 days.
Here are some of the long-term benefits I got from learning to meditate:
I reduced the time it took me to fall asleep from 1‚Äì2 hours to 10‚Äì15 minutes. The quality of my sleep also tends to be better.
I‚Äôm not a stressful person, but I‚Äôve seen a reduction of stress nonetheless. A lot of people report being much less stressed from doing meditation.
I have more clarity on my emotions, body, and mind, leading me to make better decisions.
And one I find really important but is often overlooked: I‚Äôm much faster at context switching. Most of us work on different projects at the same time, and switching from one context to another takes time. I reduce that time by doing a quick 5-minute meditation session.
Of course, you can expect similar results in your life when you stick to it.

Forming good habits is a powerful tool to increase your motivation for doing anything.
Forming bad habits, on the flip-side, can be extremely dangerous for your life.
By knowing how habits take form and how they work, you can better control what habits you form and get rid of habits that are detrimental to you.
The best way I‚Äôve found to learn to keep your habits in check is to be accountable for your good or bad habits. Find one or multiple people that you report to on a regular basis. The more frequent the better.
Find someone you don‚Äôt know that much, or at all. They‚Äôre less likely to sugarcoat it for you and will be less lenient. Ideally, that someone would be working on the same habits.
Noticed how people tend to stick to the gym more when they go with someone else or take classes?
That‚Äôs accountability at work.
Habits, contrary to beliefs, are not located in the same area of your brain as your memories. Astonishingly, and consequently, people with learning disabilities can still form habits. That‚Äôs also how you can never truly unlearn to ride a bicycle.
The first 8 hours:
Find and report to an accountability partner every day. Spend 10 minutes exchanging and encouraging each other. Do that for at about 48 days.
I used to go straight to my video games after work, playing all evening and going to bed late. When I was only 15 years old, my older brother told me the following, after always seeing me play my Gameboy Advance on the couch every day:
I‚Äôm happy to prove him wrong now. Most of it started when I formed the good habit of practicing 3 skills every morning before starting work.
I‚Äôm now in the best physical shape I‚Äôve ever been in my life, I eat healthier, workout almost every day, I learn something new on a daily basis, and I sleep much better.
As a result, I live a happier and more fulfilled life.
When your habits work in favour of taking care of your health, you start to see positive change in your life. You‚Äôre more motivated to get rid of the bad habits and become more driven.

Now, this is a skill I personally need to spend more time on.
I count Selling, Saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù and Saying ‚Äúno‚Äù as part of negotiating.
How often can you create win-win situations?
That‚Äôs what true negotiation is about. A negotiation where only one of two parties gets to win is not a negotiation, it‚Äôs a loss.
For centuries, people and organizations alike have thrived by mastering the art of negotiation. Without good negotiation skills, businesses stand no chance. It was true hundreds of years ago, and it‚Äôs even truer today and beyond.
Part of negotiating is learning to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù to the right things. Check the resources section below for help on that.
The next time you think about a negotiation situation, think win-win. What most don‚Äôt realize is that we negotiate almost on a daily basis. A lot of our interaction with other people are about interacting.
Where to go for dinner? What to watch tonight? What mode of transportation to use?, etc.
Once you realize that negotiation is a skill and it needs practice, you‚Äôll start to find many scenarios around you that are good practice. If you can‚Äôt think of any, simply search ‚Äúpractice negotiation skills‚Äù in your favourite search engine, there are tons of results!
The first 8 hours:
Prepare 8 case scenarios ranging from the workplace, romance, friend activities, haggling, business, etc. Find at least one person to practice each scenario with. Practice each scenario once a week for 15 minutes. Do that for four weeks.
If you are salaried, it will help you negotiate a better salary and benefits. You‚Äôll also be able to negotiate to work on the most interesting projects for you.
If you are trying to find a job, you‚Äôll know better what they are looking for and adapt to your interviewer.
In your romantic life, you‚Äôll handle conflicts better, and likely have less of them too.
When haggling in markets, you‚Äôll be able to get better deals.
In business, you‚Äôll get more clients to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to you.
And probably the most important benefit is that it improves your confidence.

Back in university, I had a course about discrete mathematics. I hated it. Especially the logic part of it, which is strange considering I now call myself a logical person.
What I didn‚Äôt realize at the time was that it was one of the most formative courses of my life. I learned to think more logically and make better-informed decisions.
And it‚Äôs not only discrete mathematics but many other branches of maths develop your analytical and reasoning skills. What at the time seemed like a skill I would not ever use turned out to be a great exercise to develop other parts of my brain.
While I may not use algebra or calculus frequently, the logical mindset I developed through it changed many aspects of my life.
Learning mathematical thinking is basically the same as what you do in school, you practice sample problems. The difference now is that no one is forcing you to do it, plus you are aware of the real-world benefits of doing it (see below).
There are tons of resources on the subject but the free resources I listed below should be enough to get you started.
The first 8 hours:
Do the exercises in chapter 2 of this Exercise Booklet: http://disi.unitn.it/~ldkr/ml2014/ExercisesBooklet.pdf. Go from trivial to easy. After 8 hours, you should be able to do Medium problems.
The main benefit is to increase your analytical and reasoning skills. This will help you make better-informed decisions, including during negotiation scenarios.
You‚Äôll run businesses more efficiently. You‚Äôll be a better manager. You‚Äôll make more money because you‚Äôll know how to manage it better.
You‚Äôll be more productive simply by knowing how to better analyze your time.

Most of the other skills on my list are intellectual skills but it‚Äôs not to say that physical skills are not useful.
In fact, having coordination and flexibility is one of the most important parts of living a healthy life. And without being healthy, it‚Äôs hard to even think about the skills above.
Back when I was in Spain, journaling from the beach, I met this incredibly fit guy doing stretches. I thought to myself, maybe he would have some tips for me to get fit like he. He was, after all, working intensively on my physical shape back then.
His secret was not what I expected. He didn‚Äôt even work out or eat tons of protein. He was just stretching every day and he was a vegan.
He showed me some tricks, which are really hard to explain in text. Check the resources section below for sample stretching exercises. They‚Äôre really advanced, but if you do them every day as he did, you‚Äôll notice you‚Äôll get much better at them in a short period of time.
And what‚Äôs great about these stretches is that they can be done from anywhere and require no equipment, or minimal equipment.
The first 8 hours:
Option A: Home Stretching
Practice one of the stretching exercises in the resources below for 15 minutes every day for 24 days.
Option B: Yin Yoga
Do 8 sessions of 1 hour of practice at a yoga studio or practice at home for 30 minutes over the course of 16 days.
This skill will open the doors to more physical activities. The more coordination and flexibility you have, the easier it will be to perform at any sport or physical activity. I‚Äôm no cardiac expert but I‚Äôm sure it helps with blood circulation too.

8 timeless skills.
8 hours each.
That‚Äôs only 64 hours that will change the rest of your life forever.
Not only will you be more skilled, but you‚Äôll also be equipped to learn anything new much faster. You‚Äôll be more adaptable. You‚Äôll make better-informed decisions. You‚Äôll be in better physical health. And more!
Even if it‚Äôs only 64 hours, take your time. Learn one a month. Practice every day, if only for a short period of time.
We all say we‚Äôre so busy, but everyone can squeeze in 15‚Äì30 minutes of practice a day. The consistency and repetition will make it a habit and it will be so much easier to learn them.
Are you ready to change your life for the better? Not only temporarily, but for the rest of your life?
You can do this!

That‚Äôs how I felt.
Tucked beneath what may have been the world‚Äôs softest blanket.
I took a deep breath and rolled onto my side. It was a familiar moment ‚Äî the moment when my 6 a.m. alarm clock sounded, after a night of tossing and turning.
The moment when my daily responsibilities had yet to beckon me. The moment when the clouds of my imagination felt more real than writing lines of code.
In a few minutes, I would answer the same question I had faced every weekday for the past year:
At the time, I was working as a programmer for an NYC media company.
Balancing a full-time job with the responsibilities of scaling my startup, JotForm, taught me a lot about myself.
Among other things, I learned that I was somewhat risk-averse.
The typical path of raising venture capital wasn‚Äôt appealing to me. Additionally, as someone who highly values personal freedom, I didn‚Äôt want to make myself beholden to anyone.
This meant two things:
I want to share my experience of overcoming procrastination while scaling a side project into a company that now employs more than 130 people.
But before diving in, it might be interesting to take a look at how two types of founders handle procrastination: VC-backed founders vs bootstrappers who build their startups without any outside funding.
Bootstrappers like myself aren‚Äôt the only entrepreneurs who sometimes grapple with the snooze button.
However, VC-backed founders may have a slight psychological advantage when compared to their bootstrapping counterparts: The pressure that comes with taking someone else‚Äôs money.
But that‚Äôs not all.
VC-backed founders are motivated to ‚Äúpay investors back‚Äù sooner rather than later for another reason: Once a company has grown accustomed to a certain level of spending, scaling back becomes next to impossible.
Should the company fail to gain traction within 12 to 18 months, it could very well become another failure statistic.
Thus, the VC-backed founder who doesn‚Äôt feel like sending out emails Monday morning has every incentive to do so.
Conversely, the bootstrapper must learn how to push through procrastination ‚Äî without the motivating force of a ticking clock and a room full of unhappy investors.
I encountered this learning curve while building JotForm in 2006. It was my first year in business, and my bedroom served as the company headquarters.
While I loved what I was building ‚Äî a user-friendly form builder to help organizations enhance productivity ‚Äî the temptation to procrastinate sometimes got the best of me.
Whether it was the lull of my comfy bed or the laughter promised by a favorite TV show, my home office was riddled with distractions.
During this time, I read many books about entrepreneurship, productivity, and procrastination. Sometimes their advice worked for me, and other times it didn‚Äôt.
When I became especially curious about the topic of procrastination, I often wondered:
Through self-observation, one thing became clear: There was always a reason for my procrastination.
Whenever I noticed the urge to put something off, I tried to ask myself ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù Surely enough, my mind always answered.
Once I had identified the real problem ‚Äî that was causing the feeling of avoidance ‚Äî I could develop an appropriate plan of action to reclaim my productivity.
As simple as it sounds, identifying the root problem is somewhat contrary to common advice. The internet is filled with articles that advise us to push through feelings of resistance.
Heidi Grant, a social psychologist, and Harvard Business Review contributor, echoes this sentiment:
While I completely agree and have often written about how organizational systems can enhance productivity, I believe something extremely important is often overlooked:
‚ÄúJust do it‚Äù isn‚Äôt a sustainable solution for beating chronic procrastination. If we repeatedly find ourselves avoiding certain tasks, an underlying problem needs to be addressed.
Once we identify the real cause, we can search for the right productivity hacks and solutions to meet our needs.
Here are the most common reasons that I figured often lead us to procrastinate:
Think back to the last time you started a new project. You probably felt excited about executing that new marketing strategy, blog content idea, or programming stack.
Fast forward a couple of weeks, and you now find yourself approaching the same task with a twinge of discouragement.
Observe your procrastinating mind in action, and it‚Äôs probably saying something like: My hard work isn‚Äôt being rewarded; this isn‚Äôt fun.
Science says humans are intrinsically more motivated by instant gratification than delayed gratification. Considering that worthwhile projects are rarely built overnight, this tendency is annoyingly inconvenient. The solution?
Stanford University behavioral scientist and lecturer BJ Fogg recommends creating systematic behavioral changes that correspond with ‚Äúsmall wins.‚Äù
In other words, create your own way to celebrate small milestones. According to Fogg, every task should be accompanied by ‚Äúa trigger‚Äù ‚Äî and the easier the action better.
Say you‚Äôre committed to writing content for your new website. You might make an agreement with yourself to write one paragraph after each time you use the restroom, and continue to follow this trigger throughout the day.
Once you‚Äôve completed the task, Fogg urges you to celebrate in a predetermined manner. The celebration could be as simple as treating yourself to a piece of chewing gum or as active as taking a bike ride through a favorite part of town.
Treat the series of actions like a game:
Why does this work? Creating small wins provides an incentive to keep working toward the finish line. Eventually, the actions create a habit that may become enjoyable.
Another common reason for procrastination? Having so much to do that we‚Äôre not sure where to begin.
During the early days of building JotForm, I wasn‚Äôt always sure what to work on. With seemingly endless tasks begging for my attention, I often ended up ‚Äúprocrastinating‚Äù with low-value activities.
Based on my conversations with other founders, I know my experience was far from unique. A lack of organizational systems leads to unnecessary feelings of overwhelm, confusion and avoidance.
Here‚Äôs the key:
The more systems we put in place, the less we find ourselves procrastinating. I‚Äôm reminded of the importance of this each year when I visit my family. They own a small olive farm that runs like a well-oiled machine.
Everyone knows what needs to happen first, second and third when we harvest the fruit. With no room for guesswork, procrastination is virtually non-existent.
This is the unofficial mantra of Silicon Valley tech founders.
However, look beneath the surface, and a different image will emerge: ambitious entrepreneurs who are terrified of making a bad decision.
As one anonymous insider shared with management consultant and Forbes contributor Rob Asghar:
While some founders cope by taking shortcuts, others stall out due to perfectionism. The tendency shows up in the form of delayed launch dates, missed deadlines, and ‚Äúproductive procrastination.‚Äù
During the early days, it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for me to spend a ridiculous amount of time on tasks that didn‚Äôt really matter.
Meanwhile, I was missing out on opportunities to grow our customer base, forge business partnerships, and help even more organizations enhance their productivity with user-friendly forms.
This was another reason I made the controversial decision to forego venture capital. I knew the pressure of a board looking over my shoulder would clash with my inner perfectionist.
Does that mean I never procrastinated for fear of failure? No ‚Äî but I could be gentle with myself when it happened.
Hendrickson recommends that we should consistently remind ourselves of the crucial difference between who we are and what we achieve.
Easier said than done, but it‚Äôs sound advice.
Surprise, surprise ‚Äî the most common reason for procrastination may actually be disliking the task at hand.
It‚Äôs no secret that building a business involves several moving parts. Understandably, everyone enjoys some tasks more than others.
One person may have an affinity for cold email campaigns, while another would rather play in traffic.
In such instances, HBR contributor Heidi Grant recommends using something she calls ‚Äúif-then planning.‚Äù The process involves identifying the specific steps needed to complete a task and ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî where and when you will do it.
For example: If it‚Äôs 11 a.m. then I will stop what I‚Äôm doing and cold email prospects.
Grant claims the process is different than relying on sheer willpower alone.
Personally, I find it more effective to ask targeted questions:
Once I reconnect with my goals and remind myself of the potential outcomes, I‚Äôm back on track. Obviously, there is no ‚Äúright way‚Äù to deal with procrastination.
These are just some of the methods that have worked for me over the years. Everyone has unique personality quirks, internal motivations, and reasons for procrastinating.
Translation: The newest productivity hack everyone is raving about may not work for you. And that‚Äôs okay.
Identify your personal reasons for procrastinating, apply the best-suited advice and ignore the rest.
Oh, and do your best not to hit snooze ‚Äî no matter how cozy your bed might feel.

Darius Foroux|3.1K|5|https://medium.com/darius-foroux/how-to-be-productive-according-to-ancient-philosophy-aafdcac74f43?source=---------2---------------------|How To Be Productive According To Ancient Philosophy|"Improving productivity has been a pursuit of the modern human being from the start of civilization.
Somehow, we believe that productivity is something that became important after the industrial revolution. We assume that, because we live busy lives, we need to optimize our time ‚Äî especially in the 21st century.
That‚Äôs not true. Productivity has been a topic of discussion ever since ancient eastern and western philosophy started. It‚Äôs a universal theme. I believe it‚Äôs in our nature to make better use of our time.
Because that‚Äôs what productivity means. On a deeper level, we all realize we have limited time. You and I both know that we‚Äôre not getting younger.
Time is ticking. It stops for no one. We need to use it. Etcetera, etcetera ‚Äî we get the idea. And yet, without a clear productivity strategy, we squander our time like we have a limitless supply.
We watch endless hours of mind-numbing TV shows and movies. We spend too much time on social media looking at the lives of people we don‚Äôt give a shit about.
And when our lives and careers do not progress, we complain: ‚ÄúWhy does my life suck and feel empty?‚Äù Because you‚Äôre wasting your damn time!That‚Äôs why!
It‚Äôs time to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to wasting time on useless things that do not bring you anything but short-term pleasure. It‚Äôs time to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to a life of productivity that will bring you a better health, wealth, and more inner satisfaction.
Let‚Äôs start by learning the following 7 productivity lessons from the most well-known philosophers in history. These lessons have helped me a lot, and I hope they will do the same for you.
Who else could give this monumental piece of advice other than Socrates? The founder of Western philosophy realized that it‚Äôs easy to fill your life with meaningless tasks.
But what happens when you do that? The busyness leads to unproductiveness. You end up doing many things in a mediocre way. Instead, focus your time and energy on a few important things.
Don‚Äôt take on more tasks and responsibilities.We often want to get more out of life. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to do more things.
That‚Äôs why the most important productivity lesson is to understand that it‚Äôs not about doing more ‚Äî it‚Äôs about doing the same in less time. We‚Äôll get to HOW you do that later.
Time is a paradoxical concept. Life is long. But our days are short. We can achieve a lot in a lifetime. We can achieve little in a day.
Once you realize that, you won‚Äôt try to do the impossible on an average day. Take it easy. Make small progress every day. Do that by only setting 3‚Äì4 important tasks that will directly contribute to what you want to achieve in life.
If you don‚Äôt have clear goals in your life, it‚Äôs not the end of the world. Aim for universal concepts like self-improvement, joyfulness, and having good relationships. Become the best version of yourself.
But realize that your days are short ‚Äî only set 3‚Äì4 tasks you want to complete.
Set goals. But don‚Äôt stare yourself blind on them. Instead, give your attention to the job itself.
It‚Äôs easy to daydream about all the things we want to do in the future. But that puts us in the wrong state of mind. We risk sacrificing the present for the future. No matter how hard you work today, never see it as a sacrifice.
You will end up resenting yourself. Instead,enjoy your work.Take pride in it. That will not only lead to better results, it will also give you fulfillment.
Elimination is a key strategy for every productive person. You shouldn‚Äôt only eliminate non-essential tasks, but everything that distracts you.
The more you eliminate, the more focus and tranquility you have. Look at yourself as a sculptor. You‚Äôve been given a massive stone. Your task is to eliminate so much until you end up with a perfect piece of art.
Is social media polluting your soul? Eliminate it. Are some people causing you hurt and drama? Eliminate them from your life. Continue eliminating everything else that has a negative impact on your sanity and productivity.
As the famous Roman biographer Plutarchrealized, the ego loves praise, but also blame. In fact, your ego loves any type of attention.
At all times, refuse to please your ego. All you have to do is to be aware that you have an ego. Most people live their lives without ever realizing their ego is hurting their work.
When you excessively blame yourself for things that go wrong, you end up hating yourself ‚Äî and ultimately, everyone else. And when you do the opposite, you end up loving yourself in an unhealthy way. That‚Äôs also called narcissism. A little never hurts.
But when you overdo it, you sacrifice the quality of your work. Hence, don‚Äôt blame or praise yourself. Instead, celebrate the process, not the outcomes.
One unproductive day can destroy your whole momentum. And that can set you back months. Never underestimate how difficult it is to live a productive life.
And realize that most people in your environment will not understand you. ‚ÄúWhat does one more drink hurt?‚Äù Well, A LOT. Even when you‚Äôre resting, do something little that brings you closer to your goals. Read a book, go to the gym, write in your journal.
No matter how small your effort, keep moving and stop for nothing.
Whether we realize it or not, everything we do is part of a system. The first thing you do when you wake up, what you do when you start working, how much you work, where you work, what you eat, whether you work out or not, and so forth.
All your small actions combined, form your system for living. And that leads to the big outcomes in life: More happiness, fulfillment, and better health, wealth ‚Äî it‚Äôs all a result of your system.
So if you don‚Äôt have a productivity system, create one. Like Lao Tzu says, think about the small actions. Like everything in life, small things lead to big things. It‚Äôs up to you to decide WHAT big things you get.
Will you get good or bad outcomes? The latter requires wasting your time, the former requires productive action ‚Äî every day. What will it be?
There‚Äôs one question at the core of my work: How can we live a useful life that matters? http://dariusforoux.com/

If you asked me a few years ago, I would probably laugh it off: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave that for tomorrow.‚Äù
Dumb move. If you don‚Äôt have a personal finance strategy, there‚Äôs a chance you will never get wealthy. The average millennial earns $40-$50K a year and has $20-$40K in student debt.
But the high achieving millennial earns up to 7X more than the average. The same is true for people of all ages. The difference between average earners and above-earners is huge.
Once I realized that, I got serious about money. But I didn‚Äôt focus on making more money ‚Äî a mistake that many of us make. We always think more cash is the solution to everything.
‚ÄúAll my problems will be solved once I have a little bit more cash on hand.‚Äù Sorry to disappoint you, but that will never happen. As your bank account grows, your problems will too.
Yes, earning more is important. Not only for your bank account but for your career development. As you get better and have more experience you can earn more.
But we must stop thinking that the solution to all our problems is more money. We‚Äôre better off by creating a strategy that helps us to manage money better ‚Äî that alone will help us break away from the average earners. To do that, I‚Äôve created 7 money rules for myself.
Here‚Äôs some common sense: It takes more time to make money than to spend it. You work thousands of hours to make a certain amount of money. And then, you can drop it all on a new car, luxury vacation, watch, or anything else that you desire.
We all know that, right? And yet, we keep on spending money like it‚Äôs nothing. I know this is something your granddad probably said, but the easiest way to grow your bank account is NOT to spend it all.
It‚Äôs solid advice. The ancient Stoics knew about this too. True freedom means you desire less.
When does the interest rate generally go up? When does it go down? What are bonds? What‚Äôs inflation? When do you get inflation? What‚Äôs a market cycle?
Why do economies generally collapse? What‚Äôs debt? Who prints money? Why do they print money?
I can go on forever, but you get the point. Look, you don‚Äôt have to be an economist (I sure ain‚Äôt one). But do yourself a favor, read a book like A Random Walk Down Wallstreet by Burton Malkiel. It‚Äôs an excellent summary of how the economy and investing work. Or, spend some time on Investopedia.com and figure out the answers to all the above questions ‚Äî and more.
The point is that basic knowledge about how all this stuff works prevents panic. ‚ÄúOh shit! The market is down! What now!!‚Äù Panicking will not help you.
Personal debt destroys your net worth like nothing else. To be clear, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with borrowing money.
If you want to start a business or do big real estate deals, it‚Äôs often necessary and smart to take on debt. But we must be wise about taking on debt. Like investing, there are rules to it.
One thing is sure: Never borrow money to buy a car, electronics, or anything else that goes down in value.
But when it comes to more complex things like growing/starting a business, investing in real estate, or even your education, think carefully before you go into debt. Remember that borrowing money is not free.
This is obvious by now. Desire less, avoid debt, and save as much as you can. Personal finance is called personal finance for a reason.
Your money strategy depends on your age, personality, place you live, education, experience, etc. A person who lives in Manhattan probably can‚Äôt buy an apartment. It‚Äôs overpriced, and renting is probably smarter.
Buying an apartment makes more sense in a city with lower real estate prices. In that case, renting is more expensive. No matter what you do, always make sure you have enough cash so you can make an investment if you spot an opportunity.
How much in savings is enough? That‚Äôs up to you. What figure makes you feel comfortable?
This article is for people who do NOT want to become professional investors or traders. We invest for the long-term ‚Äî not to make money today or even in a year.
My investment strategy is focused on the long-term. But that means I also need to generate income today so I can pay the bills. How do you do that? That‚Äôs your short-term strategy.
My personal short-term money strategy is based on improving my skills and creating multiple income streams. I invest a lot in my personal education because I realize more skills mean more earning power.
Also, I don‚Äôt rely on one big paycheck. Instead, I have multiple ways I generate value. That means less risk. If one income stream disappears, you‚Äôll still have others.
You see, these rules are not all about making more money. Yes, it‚Äôs important to have multiple income streams. But before you focus on generating more money, get better at dealing with the cash you already have and improve your skills.
The most important question you can ask yourself today is this: Can I generate value?
If the answer is no, then make it your first priority turn that into a yes. Figure out how successful people are rewarded. You can‚Äôt learn that from one article. Read books, study investors, try things out, talk to wealthy people, etc.
You want to generate value ‚Äî either by working for it or investing. And whether you get paid 10 bucks on 10.000, the principles of value creation are always the same. A person who can make a grand can also make ten grand, and so forth.
When you find out how to make your bank account grow instead of decreasing it, you‚Äôre already on the way to make your net worth grow.

We focus on what we believe we lack. And we judge our own setbacks much more harshly than we would judge others‚Äô challenges.
Even worse, ruminating on perceived shortcomings drains valuable energy that could be used more productively.
It‚Äôs not always easy to treat ourselves with kindness, understanding, and empathy, though.
When people ask me how I‚Äôve built my startup to 4.2 million users, they want me to talk about passion or how much I love what I‚Äôm doing.
The truth is I‚Äôve often been my own worst critic across this journey which has been full of ups and downs. And I‚Äôve learned that cultivating self-compassion takes time. It took me 12 years.
Self-compassion is an attitude we can all learn. And it‚Äôs also an attitude that I want to model for my teams at JotForm.
I wanted to share a few thoughts on what ‚Äúself-compassion‚Äù means, and how we can actually cultivate more kindness toward ourselves.
While self-esteem is a positive emotion we feel toward ourselves, especially when things are going well, self-compassion is about being kind to ourselves at all times ‚Äî even when we fail.
Dr. Kristin Neff, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin, and an expert on self-compassion, says that people with high levels of self-compassion exhibit three important behaviors:
Imagine it‚Äôs your turn to present a monthly report. Just before the meeting begins, your nerves start to creep in. You stumble through your notes, skip key pages, and you can feel the group‚Äôs attention slipping away with every minute.
In the end, it wasn‚Äôt your best performance.
Rather than beating yourself up in a cycle of negative thinking, self-compassion promotes a more understanding reaction.
Sure, you feel a little down, but the experience doesn‚Äôt shatter the rest of your day ‚Äî or your month. You simply acknowledge that everyone struggles sometimes.
Though a healthy dose of self-esteem never hurts, studies show that self-compassion is even more beneficial for well-being and performance. It‚Äôs also far more than a ‚Äútouchy-feely‚Äù response to challenges, both big and small.
Developing self-compassion has many potential benefits for our professional lives.
People with self-compassion typically have a ‚Äúgrowth mindset.‚Äù When they experience a failure or setback, they focus on their ability to grow and improve, rather than giving up.
That‚Äôs because people with a growth mindset see traits and abilities as malleable. They know, for example, that they can learn from something like a botched presentation.
On a related note, self-compassion helps people to be more resilient.
In a powerful study on self-compassion, Dr. Neff and her colleagues worked with U.S. veterans to test their resilience after returning from war. Using a 26-item questionnaire, the researchers rated subjects‚Äô level of self-compassion. The study concluded that the more self-compassionate veterans were, the less severe their PTSD symptoms were.
As Dr. Neff told the New York Times,
Self-compassionate people are better at owning up to their mistakes, too.
When researchers at UC Berkeley measured how self-compassion affects personal growth, they found that people who had just completed a self-compassion exercise were more motivated to admit and apologize for their mistakes than those who had done self-esteem or positive distraction exercises.
The self-compassion group was also more committed to avoid repeating their mistakes.
Empathetic managers also create stronger connections with their employees.
When self-compassionate leaders have the growth mindset I mentioned earlier, it extends to their employees, too. They‚Äôre more invested in team development and typically offer constructive feedback to help employees can improve.
When leaders care about progress, it motivates everyone to improve ‚Äî and hopefully, to exceed the expectations we set.
Self-compassion can also be increasingly beneficial as your career unfolds.
People with self-compassion often stay true to themselves, because they care more about doing fulfilling work than chasing social approval.
This authenticity pushes them to pursue roles that fit their passions and personalities.
According to Harvard researchers, ‚ÄúExpressing empathy produces physiological effects that calm us at the moment and strengthen our long-term sustainability.‚Äù These physical benefits prevent the kind of burnout and health risks associated with chronic stress.
In terms of mental wellbeing, self-compassion has many of the same benefits as self-esteem: less depression, more optimism, greater happiness, and more life satisfaction.
As we all know: happier workers are better, more productive workers.
As I mentioned earlier, cultivating self-compassion takes time. I always think of it as a muscle that must be exercised day in and out, with full control.
According to Dr. Neff, there are three components of self-compassion: mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness.
1 Mindfulness means being aware of the here and now. And in difficult situations, it means being aware of your suffering, rather than ignoring your pain.
Before we treat ourselves with compassion, we have to understand what we‚Äôre feeling ‚Äî the pain, the discomfort, the shame ‚Äî and what situation or event is causing those feelings.
Once you quiet your mind and acknowledge what you‚Äôre feeling, you give yourself the emotional space required to move forward.
2 Acknowledging our common humanity means reminding yourself that we‚Äôre all human. We all suffer, and others would likely feel the same in your situation. We all make mistakes. Instead of feeling ashamed of that presentation blip, remind yourself that it happens to everyone at times, and it‚Äôs normal to feel a little embarrassed. Then, allow yourself to move on.
3 Self-kindness means having a warm-hearted response to yourself. If the presentation didn‚Äôt go well, don‚Äôt beat yourself up. Don‚Äôt be more judgmental of yourself than you would be of others. Quiet the overly-critical inner voice, and instead, try speaking to yourself the same way you would a friend.
Dr. Neff even suggests treating yourself to a small act of kindness, such as drinking a soothing cup of tea or listening to music.
Finally, one small trick that can be incredibly powerful after a setback: write yourself a letter in the third person, as if you were a friend. List your accomplishments and your most enduring positive qualities.
This process can help give you the perspective and reassurance you need to bounce back, and to avoid getting KO‚Äôd after a minor blow.
In today‚Äôs competitive workforce, self-compassion is an underrated virtue.
By actively practicing the three components of self-compassion, however, we can all develop a more compassionate relationship with ourselves ‚Äî and those around us.
It‚Äôs difficult to rewrite your inner monologues. When something goes wrong, that critical voice inside can get louder. It‚Äôs especially common for high-achievers; people who set lofty goals high and expect a lot from themselves.
But once we learn to tell ourselves a new story, one that focuses on our common humanity, we can reshape how we react to setbacks.
Like the penguin, we can stop dwelling on the negative and free ourselves to live happier, more productive lives.

From thigh slaps to squats to light jumps, players will do just about anything to maintain their high energy and laser-focus.
A crucial part of the match, however, occurs in the brief pause between games: the 90-second changeover break, when players rest before switching sides.
Watch closely, and you‚Äôll see how players make the most of these precious moments: burying their heads under a towel to meditate, changing their racquets, or fueling up on water and energy drinks.
Some players, like the great Serena Williams, have even sipped a quick coffee before returning to the court.
Whatever their method, these pro athletes understand the value of a break. A brief reprieve can provide a fresh surge of energy and motivation for the next game.
Much like a tennis match, the workday can also be a daunting mental and physical challenge, especially if you want to perform your best throughout the day.
In addition to finding your optimal work hours, taking multiple breaks can increase your productivity all day long.
I‚Äôll repeat that for emphasis:
Our workaholic culture and the business epidemic tend to villainize time-wasting behaviors during work ‚Äî like leisurely lunches and web browsing ‚Äî but research proves that breaks can enhance your performance, on many levels.
Brief periods of distraction have been shown to improve both decision-making and creativity. On the other hand, prolonged attention to a single task can actually hinder performance. Pulling an all-nighter for one assignment? Not such a good idea after all.
There‚Äôs also evidence that waking periods of mental rest can improve memory formation. Apparently, during rest periods, your brain reviews and ingrains what it previously learned. Without rest, you run the risk of experiencing the old ‚Äúin one ear, out the other‚Äù phenomenon.
At my company, JotForm, I incorporate intentional breaks throughout the day ‚Äî and not only do I take breaks, but I try to take the right kind of breaks.
I wanted to share a few ways that help me add breaks to my workday; how to properly waste time.
You might be wondering, what kind of breaks should I take? Or, if you‚Äôre a manager, what kind of breaks should I encourage my employees to take?
Generally, a good break is one that allows your prefrontal cortex to rest. That‚Äôs the part of your brain dedicated to logical thinking, executive functioning, and using willpower to override impulses.
There are many ways to do this, but it can be as simple as letting your mind wander.
One report found that daydreaming or zoning out has similar benefits as meditation. And meditation not only increases focus, but it gives your overworked prefrontal cortex a break.
Taking a quick pause for physical activity can be extremely beneficial ‚Äî and that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to squeeze in a SoulCycle class at lunch.
Just a 5-minute walking break every hour can improve your health and mental well-being. And mental wellness is critical on a personal and a professional level because research shows that happier workplaces are more productive.
Not only are walks good for your health, but prolonged sitting is actually bad for us. That‚Äôs one of the reasons we offer most of our 110 employees both standing and normal desks.
Walking can also boost creativity. A study from Stanford University showed that when people tackled mental tasks that required imagination, walking led to more creative thinking than sitting.
In the literary world, many accomplished novelists and poets have improved their craft by walking. Just a few of these famous walkers include Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf, Henry David Thoreau, and William Wordsworth.
I‚Äôm one of these workday walkers, too. Whenever possible, I walk to lunch and take long strolls with new employees, so we can get to know each other better. At our San Francisco office, we take scenic walks on the Embarcadero and enjoy the calming bay views.
If taking a break is good, taking a break with colleagues may be even better.
Social breaks are important for both personal and professional well-being. For example, social breaks can reinforce bonds, improve morale, and increase opportunities for collaboration.
After observing the social habits at a Xerox corporate office, one study found that copy repair people who hung out in the coffee room were not wasting time ‚Äî they were engaging in productive conversations about on-the-job challenges.
Other studies have shown that informal, casual conversations between call center workers increased productivity by 20%.
To make the most of social breaks, time management expert Laura Vanderkam recommends grabbing a coffee with a mentee or taking an afternoon walk with a direct report.
Trees, plants and green spaces are not only aesthetically pleasing, but taking breaks in a natural environment can significantly boost employee well-being, reduce stress, enhance innovative potential, and strengthen personal connections.
Time in nature dramatically improves our ability to think expansively and make better decisions.
It also seems to make us more helpful. For example, people who have just walked in a park or other natural environment are more likely to notice when others need help ‚Äî and to provide that help.
It‚Äôs no coincidence that forward-thinking companies like Google and Facebook prioritize plant life in their office designs. In fact, Facebook‚Äôs most recent update to their Menlo Park headquarters included a sprawling rooftop garden.
In many East Asian countries, ‚Äúforest bathing‚Äù has also become a popular office practice, because just a few minutes in nature has measurable benefits for our psychological well-being and our physical health.
Vending machine calling your name? That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing.
Snack breaks are a great way to refresh during the workday. According to the University of Roehampton researcher Leigh Gibson, your brain works best with a consistent blood glucose level: 25 grams is optimal. So don‚Äôt forget to fuel yourself throughout the day.
Even web surfing, in moderation, can have a positive effect. Researchers at the National University of Singapore found that browsing the internet ‚Äúserves an important restorative function.‚Äù That mini-break spent shopping on Amazon can revive you for the next task.
Ultimately, almost any mental time-out is effective, as long as you‚Äôre giving your prefrontal cortex a rest. Some studies, however, do recommend that these breaks should still be work-related. Specifically, your break should be a time to learn something new, reflect on the big picture, or make positive connections with others.
With looming deadlines and colleagues waiting for answers, forcing yourself to take breaks can be challenging. At JotForm, I pre-plan my day to include both dedicated work and constructive break times.
According to MIT Sloan Senior Lecturer Bob Pozen, you should take a time-out every 75 to 90 minutes. This is based on studies of professional musicians, who are most productive when they practice for this amount of time in a single sitting.
Another approach, called the Pomodoro Technique recommends working for 25 minutes before taking a five-minute break. This may be a better approach when a single task requires your full focus.
By using trial and error, you can figure out which technique works best for you.
It‚Äôs tempting to shun the habit of taking breaks in your workday.
‚ÄúWasting time‚Äù can feel like a productivity killer. But when they‚Äôre done thoughtfully, constructive breaks can leave you and your employees feeling focused and re-energized.
While you can‚Äôt force others to take breaks, you can encourage them to take a breather from time to time.
Managers, for example, can schedule periodic breaks throughout the day and, if possible, your office should offer pleasant break spaces ‚Äî complete with coffee, snacks and plant life. If caring for plants seems burdensome, try succulents, which require little-to-no care at all.
Try creating walking clubs and schedule walking meetings.
And remember to lead by example ‚Äî give yourself breaks, too.

A new year brings a new beginning, right?
Armed with these 17 actionable steps you'll be able to radically improve your life. Let's get to it?
How often have you set New Year resolutions just to fall shortly after 1‚Äì2 months?
New month resolutions, 90 day years, or daily themes help you get over analysis paralysis of making big life decisions.
‚ÄúI like pushing myself to the limit and pushing the envelope, and in my mind, that is not really compatible with a reliable long-term plan,‚Äù says Tim Ferriss. ‚ÄúI generally treat my life as six-month projects and two-week experiments of various types. Then I take the most attractive door that pops up, and rinse and repeat.‚Äù
Todd Herman recommends picking a 90 Day theme.
You can also commit to monthly challenges like 1) no movies, 2) daily meditation, 3) quit social media, 4) read daily for 30 mins.
Action steps:
You have a lot less time than you think, and you‚Äôre not spending it the way you think you are.
Create an hour-by-hour log to see where your time is spent over a week and you'll be shocked with results.
When Drew Houston (founder of Dropbox) did this exercise he was stunned to discover that 1) his jar was mostly filled with sand and 2) really important rocks were falling on the ground.

It's OK to have a bad day, it's not OK to have a bad week.
Figure out what makes you unique.
By learning how your machine works you can gain a tremendous edge.
When you focus on your weaknesses, everything seems like hard work. When you follow your natural strengths, work becomes a challenging play.
Take time to discover your innate abilities, blind spots, and personality traits. If you've never done it before, it will be a transforming experience (it was for me).
Action steps:
Whether you own a business or not, you're a marketer. If you want to get others to say YES to you, you must understand what makes people tick.
Brendon Burchard recommends all his clients, even his Olympic athletes, to take at least two sales courses each year and two social psychology courses.
Russell Brunson said all his millionaire mastermind members are OBSESSED with marketing. There is a reason why many successful business owners recommend Cialdini's book ‚ÄúInfluence‚Äù (and not some business book).
So get obsessed about understanding fundamental human nature, psychology, and persuasion. It will change your life.
Action steps:
Successful people are cautious about their relationship with technology.
Technology allows us to do amazing things, but we have become addicted to it.
Yuval Noah Harari says, ‚ÄúIf you are not careful, technology will start dictating your aims and enslaving you to it‚Äôs agenda [...]
We are not living in the era of hacking computers ‚Äî we are living in the era of hacking humans. Once the corporations and governments know you better than you know yourself, they could control and manipulate you and you won‚Äôt even realize it.‚Äù
Neil Strauss, for example, blocks his computer from Internet access for 22h a day (with app Freedom) and has a timed safe, where he can drop his phone into.
It‚Äôs time for you to take back control.
Action steps:
When people hear the word ‚Äúconstraint‚Äù they think of it as a negative. But in truth, it's a powerful force for good.
A constraint is where you extremely limit yourself in one field so you can be extremely creative in another.
Few examples:
Why? Because successful people know that mental energy is in limited quantity.
You can also create constraints in your work. For example, if you're a writer you could commit to only writing and mastering 3,000-word list post.
Action steps:
Few ideas: Create a weekly meal plan. Create themes for days of the week. Read this for more ideas.
Successful people spend a lot of time thinking about problems before jumping to fix them. They figure out the lead domino that would kick off all the others in one fell swoop.
Dwight D. Eisenhower has been credited as the most productive and effective president the US ever had. Using Eisenhower Matrix you can shift from being busy to becoming effective.
The core idea is that you should spend as much time as possible doing Important / Non-Urgent things, instead of putting off fires (Urgent / Important).
Action steps:
The idea of deliberate practice is often confused with just working hard.
Musicians and athletes know this naturally. They separate playing from practicing. For some reason, knowledge workers forget this. But growth doesn't just magically happen.
Michael Simmons talks about 5-hour rule. You need to learn 5 hours a week just to stay relevant.
But proactive training regimen must be developed if you want to get ahead.
Cal Newport has said, ‚ÄúDoing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that‚Äôs exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands....‚Äù
Action steps:
‚ÄúWhat am I going to do with my life?‚Äù
Don't you get anxious just thinking about that question?
Successful people are incredibly patient in long-term, but they don't waste their days worrying about years.
While you are busy asking yourself existential questions and then procrastinate watching Netflix, successful people are in the trenches figuring things out as they go.
‚ÄúThey say:‚ÄùThink Big! Have a compelling vision!‚Äù I say: Think Small. Do something super cool by the end of the day. Excellence is the next five minutes or nothing at all. It‚Äôs the quality of your next five-minute conversation. It‚Äôs the quality of, yes, your next email.‚Äú ‚Äî Tom Peters
You don't have to figure everything out now. Just be clear about what you would like to happen today and give it your best.
Action step
Don't overthink. Just pick something where you love the process, has good income potential and go do that.
But what if it's the wrong direction? ‚Äî you may ask.
You'll find out sooner. üòä
The most valuable career skill is public speaking, some would argue.
But what‚Äôs public speaking? It‚Äôs just words that impact people.
‚ÄúMore and more communication is written today,‚Äù said Jason Fried.‚ÄúGet great at presenting yourself with words, and words alone, and you‚Äôll be far ahead of most.‚Äú
After you've studied marketing from #4, with copywriting you learn how to put that knowledge in words.
Action steps:
Have you noticed?
The more time you have to complete a task, the more time it takes to do it.
You can move faster than you think. You can train yourself to shorten the time it takes to complete tasks.
Said historian Will Durant, ‚ÄúI think the ability of the average man could be doubled if it were demanded, if the situation demanded.‚Äù
You'll be blown away how fast you can move if you just make the decision to move fast.
Action steps:
Inner critic exists in all of us.
What about successful people? They have it too. The only difference is that they have learned how to manage it.
How?
The negative self-talk actually is a form of self-absorption. What is that voice in your head saying when the critic comes out? ‚Äî ‚ÄúYou don't have what it takes. Last time you just got lucky. You'll fail.‚Äù
Notice anything? Yup ‚Äî it's all about you!
When you realize this, the solution becomes simple ‚Äî shift your perspective from yourself to how your work will help other people.
Action steps:
Successful people are growth friends to others.
They know that other people‚Äôs success doesn‚Äôt diminish their own.
While insecure people constantly doubt themselves and criticize others in order to prove their self-worth, successful people compliment and help others.
Ironically, they feel better themselves as a result.
Negativity is a choice. What choice are you making?
Action steps:
When you‚Äôre too comfortable you drown in boredom and depression as Yerkes-Dodson law illustrates:
The solution? Get used to stretching yourself. Peak performance and discomfort go hand in hand.
Success can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have and uncomfortable actions you are willing to make.
Action steps:
Successful people don't fight their human nature, they learn how to manage it.
‚ÄúI think we all have two main characters in our heads: a rational decision-maker (the adult in your head) and instant gratification monkey (the child in your head who doesn't care about consequences and just wants to maximize the ease and pleasure of the present moment).
For me, these two are in a constant battle, and the monkey usually wins. But I've found that if I turn life into a yin-yang situation ‚Äî e.g. ‚Äúwork till 6 today, then no work till tomorrow‚Äù ‚Äî it's much easier to control the monkey in the work period.‚Äù ‚Äî said Tim Urban (from WaitButWhy) on his incredible TED Talk.
By acknowledging that gratification monkey exists, you can come up with solutions. The first step toward change is awareness.
Action steps:
Nowadays people are obsessed with failure.
But the truth is you don't learn the most from failures.
This idea may make you feel better, but whenever you want to do something well, you do it by studying people who are really good and have achieved results you desire.
For example, you don't study all the failed writers to learn how to become a great storyteller; you study the world's best storytellers.
Yes, if you want to become the top 1% you will fail a lot, but don't distort your thinking that you should take all your lessons from failure.
Model what works instead.
This is how Tony Robbins does it:
The quality of your life depends on questions you ask yourself.
Ask lousy questions, get lousy answers.
You can ask, ‚ÄúWhat makes me happy?‚Äù ‚Äî You‚Äôll get a good answer.
What if you ask, ‚ÄúWhat gives me bliss?‚Äù ‚Äî You‚Äôll get a great answer.
Tim Ferris has said, ‚ÄúIn my experience, going from 1x to 10x, from 10x to 100x, and from 100x to (when Lady Luck really smiles) 1000x returns in various areas has been a product of better questions. John Dewey‚Äôs dictum that ‚Äúa problem well put is half-solved‚Äù applies.‚Äù
Growth is stimulated by asking ‚Äî Why?
Here are some great questions to ask yourself:
I urge you to kick off 2019 with a bang or even better ‚Äî set a new month resolution today!
Remember people who succeed are no smarter than you, they are just people who have acquired skills and habits through patient consistency.
So start little.
You've got this!

Not quite. When you‚Äôre getting ready to launch on Product Hunt, you‚Äôve probably put months or even years of your life into this product. Failing the launch would be devastating, while doing it right can give you everything you need to turn your product into a business.
This article isn‚Äôt focused on getting upvotes, but on maximising the impact of your launch in general. By focusing on impact you‚Äôll get the fundamentals that matter most for your long-term success.
Some background: I always felt annoyed with how hard it was to keep track of the thousands of webpages we come across every month. So around 4 years ago I got the idea to create a filesystem for the web. It‚Äôs similar to the finder on a computer, but indexes text on webpages you visit. This way you can use any word on the page to retrieve it‚Äîsaving you a bunch of time every-time you need a page again.
Prior to our launch I‚Äôd spent around 1 year beta-testing. You don‚Äôt need Product Hunt to get your first users. On the contrary, you actually need a base of beta users to launch successfully. We had around 3500 beta users, which I got through contacting people in Facebook groups about Product Hunt. I used a simple message:
The main benefit to this approach is that you can literally contact thousands of people who you know are interested in or are working on new products ‚Äî since they‚Äôre in Product (Hunt) groups. You‚Äôll be surprised how many people are interested.
When someone replied, they typically asked for more information, so I made sure to give them a very brief summary of what History Search was.
This was actually the very first version of our value prop and sales pitch. I then continued the conversation with those willing/interested ‚Äî and used this information to improve the product and ‚Äústory‚Äù. Getting your story right is going to be critical during your launch.
This concludes the section about building an early-beta user audience since this article is really aimed at the next stage: leveraging your Product Hunt launch to turn your work into a business (getting reoccurring users and revenue).
Groups that worked for me
Product Hunt is a community of tech enthusiasts and product makers. Every day new products are hunted and receive upvotes. The top 5 most upvoted products get blasted in a daily newsletter to +500k members the next day.
After spending countless days, nights and dollars on History Search the main thing I needed to know was ‚Äúdo people really need History Search?‚Äù and were they willing to pay for it so I can continue working on it ‚Äî or will my hard work go in vain? Because that‚Äôs what your first users are doing in reality: they‚Äôre paying so that you can continue to work on your vision.
Obviously it‚Äôs better to finish as the top product of the day, since this will get your product in both the daily and weekly newsletter. However it‚Äôs not all about coming in first during the initial launch of your product, it‚Äôs about validation and building an engaged users base‚Äîwho are prepared to pay for your product. So as long as you get in the top 5 you‚Äôll be in the daily newsletter and you‚Äôre fine in regards to reach.
My main piece of advice about deciding when to launch is that it‚Äôs not about being done, but about being ready. The reason is simple: Your product is never going to be perfect when you launch it.
There are so many things in History Search that I want to improve. For example, I really dislike the way we onboard new users. I think it‚Äôs really tricky and confusing. But instead of iterating on it for another 2 months we launched and got it done in one day.
When you launch the right way (without focusing on upvotes), you‚Äôll get more questions, suggestions and ideas than you can ever imagine. In our case this gave us the input we needed to create an onboarding experience that answered the most common questions.
When you talk to people, you see it fall together. All of these things come up because you actually have one day where you can talk to hundreds of people. In a way you have hundreds of minds working with you ‚Äî they tell you what‚Äôs unclear about your product or message, what they love about it, and even ideas or use-cases you never thought of yourself. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to then develop everything people ask, more on that later.
Before even thinking about launching, make sure you‚Äôve thoroughly thought about how to position your product. Why did we switch from ‚ÄúYour Personal Search engine‚Äù to ‚ÄúYour Filesystem for the web‚Äù? This was because ‚Äúsearch engine‚Äù leads many people to believe it was only public pages, and so made it seem like Google. While in reality History Search does technically do the same as Google, but it indexes the web pages you visit through an integration with your browser (via browser extensions) ‚Äî so this also makes it possible to find pages behind logins.
What it is and What it does are two fundamentally different approaches to positioning, and you need both. In our case we have:
It‚Äôs important not to run this past too many people, since it will send you in a different direction every time. The main thing I learned is that your product is whatever you say it is ‚Äî for example. Is Uber a taxi company or is it the future of transportation?
Your first launch isn‚Äôt really about your product, it‚Äôs about your story and vision. The story about how you got to where you are today is important to write down, not only for the outside world but also for yourself. You‚Äôll be able to better align your pitch if you know your story well. This is exactly what I did, and even though I spent about two weeks hesitating whether to publish it or not, I eventually did. Guess what?! It was one of the best decisions I could have made ‚Äî people loved it and it even got published by The Startup. Here‚Äôs a link to the article.
Your product is never going to be perfect when you launch it. With History Search, there are so many things that I want to improve. But at first it‚Äôs all about finding the people who support you and believe in your vision.
You need a clear message. Our general tagline for History Search is ‚Äúyour way back to a million websites.‚Äù However, we deliberately decided not to use this message for Product Hunt, because we knew that it‚Äôs a more technical audience.
Your tagline has to be just right. It‚Äôs tempting to choose a funny tagline, and this might get you a lot of upvotes but:
You need an existing user base. It is very important that when you launch, you already have an existing user base. It doesn‚Äôt have to be huge, but you have to have people who really know the product already. This is critical for two reasons. You need:
You need support. Before you launch, sit down and think: Who can I genuinely ask for support to get the word of my launch out on this day? If that list of people is very small, it‚Äôs going to be difficult to launch. Because all of this is not just a way to get upvotes, it‚Äôs to get reach. And to get reach, you need some support. So you need a group of people who really believe and support the thing you‚Äôre doing.
You need a plan for getting press. This is extremely difficult for people who are launching for the first time. If you read an article about how to reach out to press, most of it is incorrect. Most of it is written by journalists, and they assume that the best way is by writing a custom email ‚Äî which may work for larger brands, but not startups.
When preparing for the History Search launch, I wrote custom emails to almost 20 people. I spent 2.5 weeks researching.
How many journalists replied? One. And he just replied to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt write about these types of services anymore.‚Äù
So you need to keep some things in mind when you‚Äôre contacting journalists.
Send the story in the email with the press information 3‚Äì5 days before launching. This is the email I used:
If journalists don‚Äôt reply to your email 3‚Äì5 days after you pitch, it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not going to cover you. I recommend sending a follow-up email in the evening of your launch ‚Äî not the same pitch ‚Äî with the result. You could even do it the next day so that you don‚Äôt bombard the journalist with the same press release over and over.
Don‚Äôt be worried if you don‚Äôt get any responses. Our story just appeared on CNET but they had never replied. I discovered the story because I couldn‚Äôt figure out why our traffic was still increasing after the launch (usually it drops) and I used Mention to find the article on CNET.
Keep in mind: If journalists from publications like CNET, Mashable, etc, are willing to write about you. Then they are helping you, you are not helping them. I am extremely grateful that Stephen Shankland, the CNET journalist, decided, based on the story I wrote, to write about History Search. He can write about a billion other things, and he chose us.
If you‚Äôre lost about what to write in your emails to journalists, here‚Äôs the basic formula for a pitch. I should actually say story and not pitch.
These are simple marketing rules, but I can guarantee that 99 out of 100 statements sent out to press do not have this last step (CTA).
In my case, I was quite sincere, and I was willing to create a story that was interesting to their audience. I would like to get History Search into the world and to reach as many people as possible.
So when it comes to press, be genuine. An event is as good as its best story, so tell yours in a way people want to read about it and you‚Äôve got a big chance getting covered.
It‚Äôs super important to make sure the different components of your listing work together ‚Äî since space to tell your story is limited. Let‚Äôs start with the first part of your message that appears in the Product Hunt feed.
What we did was use the thumbnail to show someone how it worked, and made sure the title, tagline (and don‚Äôt forget the ‚Äútags‚Äù ex. Productivity) worked together. You see how we selected productivity to show up as first ‚Äî this is because it‚Äôs a part of the story.
Next are your slides. Remember people might be intrigued by your tagline but probably still don‚Äôt understand how to use your product. That‚Äôs why we mainly used this to show use cases.
You can then use your opening comment to introduce yourself and give more details, the image is too long to post here so I‚Äôd recommend that you check out our listing here: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/history-search this will also give you an impression of what kind of responses and questions you can expect.
Tips
1 Size matters. Keep your slides under 2MB each or they‚Äôll have trouble loading for visitors on mobile or weak internet connections (ImageOptim worked great for me)
2 YouTube videos in comments. Not many people know you can also post videos in the comment section. So I‚Äôd keep the main slide to use-cases only and add your video in the comments.
3 OG Images. The first slide is automatically set as the image shown when people share your post to social media‚Äîmake it easy to load (less than 1 MB) and add slightly more context in the image.
Launch day itself is super hectic. You get distracted all the time. You need a plan ‚Äî not so that you stick to the plan perfectly, but so that you have something to reference in the midst of all the distraction. If you get a bug or an email or a news post that you have to answer on the fly, you know where to continue, because you‚Äôve created this plan.
I‚Äôve actually made the structure I used available in an Airtable (see below), it‚Äôs nothing fancy but it‚Äôs all you need to plan your launch. It‚Äôs structured as followed:
First, don‚Äôt look at your ranking. You worked really hard to make something, and you don‚Äôt want to see that you are 3rd, 4th, 5th etc. on your launch date ‚Äî it will only distract you.
With History Search, people in the office looked at it, but I didn‚Äôt. I made a plan for how this launch date was going to go.
Of all of these activities, engaging with your audience could be the most important. After years working on your startup, you might be the Albert Einstein of your product, but you can‚Äôt beat a million brains thinking together. Or even just a thousand brains. And the bottom line is that if you have a thousand people out there who are willing to talk about your product, talk with them.
First of all, it‚Äôs an amazing feeling to get support and hear from people who love your work. And second, you will learn things that you could never have imagined.
For example:
Your launch isn‚Äôt actually about you giving something to the world. It is actually you getting something: you get an opportunity to talk to people and get feedback. It‚Äôs very important that you learn from the people who are interested and also from the people who are not interested.
Especially the people who are not interested ‚Äî this is super important. Talk to those people, and don‚Äôt try to convince them. You really want to get down to the core reason of why they like or don‚Äôt like your product. And sometimes, someone will ask you about a use case you hadn‚Äôt considered, like the guy who asked if we could use History Search without indexing automatically. Because of his question, I realized that this is actually possible. You can pause the extension and then favorite a web page manually‚Äîso there you go, another selling-point without developing anything new.
Tips
1 Go Live. Go live in the morning. Social media notifies everyone of this and it will be boosted through your Facebook and Instagram followers.
2 Wait to win. The daily Product Hunt race starts at 00:00 PDT, but I‚Äôd recommend you wait an hour to see who launches on Product Hunt because if for ex. Google launches something new you‚Äôll have to compete with them.
3 Don‚Äôt expect anything of Reddit or Hacker news. Sure, there are ways to use these channels, but not unless you really build a strategy.
4 Engaging. When people engage with you, really talk to them, try to understand and learn because this is your chance.
5Traction on content matters most. Don‚Äôt link dump, it‚Äôs better to target and generate interaction in a few groups, because practically all social media only boosts content that get a lot of comments.
A few groups that I‚Äôve been in and contain many supportive and entrepreneurial people:
So did we get the validation we were looking for?
Once you‚Äôve launched, the things you learn mean you can never go back to your pre-launch perspective. My most important takeaways?
So what‚Äôs next for History Search? As I said, feedback was the most valuable thing we received from our launch date. We‚Äôre using the feedback around our onboarding process, to improve our onboarding. Stay tuned for a later article that goes deeper into that process.

Aytekin Tank|128K|7|https://medium.com/swlh/the-power-of-doing-nothing-at-all-73eeea488b8b?source=---------8---------------------|The power of doing nothing at all ‚Äì The Startup ‚Äì Medium|"The old crocodile was floating at the river‚Äôs edge when a younger crocodile swam up next to him,
Awoken from a nice long afternoon nap, the old crocodile glanced at the young crocodile with one of his reptilian eyes, said nothing and then fell back asleep atop the water.
Feeling frustrated and disrespected, the young crocodile swam off upriver to chase after some catfish, leaving behind a flurry of bubbles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show him‚Äù, he thought to himself.
Later that day the young crocodile returned to the old crocodile who was still napping and began to brag to him about his successful hunt,
Unphased the old crocodile again looked at the young crocodile, said nothing, closed his eyes and continued to float atop the water as tiny minnows muched away lightly at the algae on his underbelly.
Again, the young crocodile was angry he couldn‚Äôt get a response from the elder, and he swam off a second time upstream to see what he could hunt.
After a few hours of thrashing about he was able to hunt down a small crane. Smiling, he kept the bird in his jaws and swam back to the old crocodile, adamant about showing him who the true hunter was.
As the young crocodile rounded the bend, he saw the elder crocodile still floating in the same spot near the river‚Äôs edge.
However, something had changed ‚Äî a large wildebeest was enjoying an afternoon drink just inches near the old crocodile‚Äôs head.
In one lightning fast movement, the old crocodile bolted out of the water, wrapped his jaws around the great wildebeest and pulled him under the river.
Awestruck the young crocodile swam up with the tiny bird hanging from his mouth and watched as the old crocodile enjoyed his 500 lb meal.
The young crocodile asked him, ‚ÄúPlease... tell me... how... how did you do that?‚Äù
Through mouthfuls of wildebeest, the old crocodile finally responded,
When I was first building JotForm, I was a lot like the young crocodile ‚Äî believing that I always had to be doing something to get results.
Back then, if someone would have told me that I would see greater results by spending more time doing nothing, I would have rolled my eyes and continued to chip away at my 16 hour day of work.
I thought that in order to be successful, I had to constantly be building, working, growing and developing the next thing ‚Äî whatever that ‚Äúthing‚Äù was.
All of us have a problem with busyness. But being busy and being successful are not one in the same. And, I think if we were to make ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù more of a priority, we might find ourselves catching more wildebeests versus measly catfish.
It worked for me, and I hope it can work for you, too.
But, doing less or nothing at all is easier said than done, especially in a society that suffers from extreme busyness. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at our unhealthy obsession with staying busy...
Mankind has struggled with busyness since the beginning of time ‚Äî or at least since 425 BC when Homer walked the Earth.
The Odyssey tells the tale of the Lotus-eaters ‚Äî a strange people that slothed around all day long eating lotus and doing nothing. And, what was stranger than fiction was that these people were content with their lives.
Homer wrote that after some of Odysseus‚Äôs crew ate the Lotus-eaters Lotus fruit (say that three times fast), they became like the Lotus-eaters ‚Äî content, relaxed and a bit lethargic.
Terrified that if all of his men ate the lotus fruit they would be unmotivated to return home, Odysseus ordered the affected men to be tied to the ship benches and for the ship to set sail immediately.
It ‚Äôs interesting, Odysseus‚Äôs reaction to this feeling of ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù sounds similar to the Corporate CEO, the Startup Founder and the collegiate football coach we know today ‚Äî hardcore workaholics that despise anything that might allude to a sense of complacency.
Though, they of course are just the tip of a much larger societal iceberg that feels frozen with fear at the thought of doing nothing.
The world as a whole now measures value in terms of busyness versus quality of work. In many ways, it has become something of a status symbol to be ‚Äúbusy‚Äù.
How many times have you heard or had a conversation like this...
We‚Äôve grown to subconsciously measure a person‚Äôs worth based off how many hours they work, how much is on their plate and put simply ‚Äî whether or not they are running around like a chicken with their head cut off.
In Tim Ferriss‚Äôs 4-Hour Work Week, he pokes fun at this idea by facetiously saying that if you want a promotion, you should appear to be more busy by working longer hours, scrambling around and constantly answering emails.
But, sooner or later, all of us have to ask ourselves what our mission is ‚Äî is it to be the busiest or is it to make the most impact?
And, what‚Äôs fascinating is that when we look at some of the greatest minds to grace planet Earth, we see an interesting commonality ‚Äî they all make time for doing nothing.
Making time in your life to do nothing can be challenging ‚Äî especially during the work week where we are constantly pummeled and bombarded with meetings, notifications and an ever growing list of tasks.
Busy founders have started implementing ‚ÄúThink Weeks‚Äù into their annual schedules ‚Äî week long periods they spend reflecting, reading, thinking and living outside the all-encapsulating world that is running a business.
While young founders like Skillshare‚Äôs Mike Karnjanaprakorn have adopted this practice, as well as big names like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Ferriss, it was Bill Gates who originally made the Think Week famous.
For many years while running Microsoft, Gates would retreat into week long Think Weeks twice a year ‚Äî not vacations, but actual periods of time dedicated to doing nothing.
Gates was so adamant about his Think Weeks that family, friends and Microsoft employees were banned. Today, Gates attributes much of Microsoft‚Äôs success to the big ideas and concepts he stumbled upon while doing nothing.
You don‚Äôt necessarily have to ban family and friends to retreat into a Think Week, though. Take me as an example.
Every year, I take at least a full week off from my company and head back to my hometown to help my parents with the olive harvest.
All thoughts of startup growth or conversion rates slip away when you‚Äôre picking olives. It‚Äôs meditative and calming.
I know that olive picking won‚Äôt land me at the top of TechCrunch, but it‚Äôs a personal measure of success. And somehow, some of my best ideas come to me during this period.
For someone who can‚Äôt take an entire week off of work once a year to do nothing, I recommend taking a slightly different approach ‚Äî embracing the digital sabbath.
On either Saturday or Sunday, force yourself to step away from all forms of technology ‚Äî a practice known as a digital sabbath.
Shut off your smartphone and hide it in your closet. Powerdown the laptop and slide it under your bed. And, try with all your might to refrain from binge-watching Netflix.
Give your brain space to think by stepping away from the daily grind and doing nothing. Your mind will have time to stumble upon new ideas and further process old ones.
You may find the success that results from this practice to be similar to that of the old crocodile at the beginning of this article.
While we tell ourselves we can achieve more by scrambling, sometimes it‚Äôs better to close our eyes and just float.
And, wait, until the wildebeest shows up.

Do you abandon them, or do you finish what you start?
Juggling multiple ideas and goals ‚Äî to write, exercise, read more, wake up early and so on ‚Äî is a tough gig that often begins with excitement, but ends with procrastination, and failure to finish any one of the ideas we started.
Here are 5 different things to do when you‚Äôre overwhelmed with too many ideas and goals.
In 2003, Sheena Iyengar, Psychologist and Professor at Columbia Business School, conducted an 800,000 employee strong study, to investigate the effects that adding more investment choices had on their participation in retirement saving plans. [1]
At the end of the study period, the researchers gathered the data and plotted the results to answer the question: would more employees participate in retirement saving plans, if more investment choices were made available to them?
As we‚Äôd predict, the answer is yes. Afterall, more choice is better. And so, this would be the researchers' conclusion.
Or, was it?
The researchers discovered that adding more investment choices, reduced the likelihood that employees would participate in retirement saving plans.
As per the diagram above, for every 10 funds added to the array of options, the rate of participation drops by 2 percent. In fact, for those employees who chose to invest, adding more investment choices increased the chances that employees would invest in more conservative funds.
This is the paradox of choice. More choice often leads to less action. The more ideas and goals we pursue, the less likely we‚Äôll follow through on any one of them. And vice versa.
There are other explanations for why we fail to finish what we start. Lack of time, fear of failure, overwhelm from multiple choices that drain energy and a decline of excitement after starting a new project, can lead to chronic procrastination.
When we get stuck in motion at rest, instead of motion in action, our time and energy are wasted on efforts that produce little results.
Here are five different ways to avoid overwhelm, get started and follow through on your ideas.
1. Create mini-deadlines.
The more time it takes to complete a task, the greater the likelihood that we fall victim to ‚ÄòParkinson‚Äôs Law,‚Äô which states that, work expands to fill the time available for its completion.
For example, if you have one week to complete a three-hour task, according to Parkinson‚Äôs law, the task will increase in complexity and keep dragging on for the duration of the week. The best way to combat this problem, is to create mini-deadlines that force you to finish tasks within a short time frame.
Action: Create a list of your daily tasks and note approximately, how much time it takes to complete each one of them. Then, cut the time limit of each task in half. Aim to finish each task by these deadlines.
2. Use the 80/20 rule.
In layman‚Äôs terms, the 80/20 rule suggests that twenty percent of the what you do contributes to eighty percent of the results you get. In other words, each task can be broken down into activities that either fall into the twenty or eighty percent group.
For example, if your goal is to exercise more and lose weight, there are some exercises ‚Äî the twenty percent, like high intensity sprints ‚Äî that will significantly contribute to weight loss, more so than others ‚Äî the eighty percent, like stretching.
The key is to experiment, discover and focus your time and energy on the twenty percent activities, that yield the greatest returns. This way, you can get more done by doing less ‚Äî and in less time.
3. Trust your gut.
Often, we hesitate to get started and take action on ideas, because of the fear of failure, rejection and self-doubt. Countless hours are spent researching and planning to take action, but when it comes time to jump ship, we stay on the boat and fail to follow through on our plans.
In the book Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking (audiobook), world-renowned journalist and author, Malcolm Gladwell, makes a strong case that, often, snap judgements made within seconds, lead to better decisions than a more cautious, thoroughly planned approach.
Next time you‚Äôre not sure of what to do next or how to do it, trust your gut instinct and take action on the first thought that crosses your mind, because more times than not, you‚Äôll probably be on the right track.
4. Develop the habit of finishing.
Many people have mastered the art of starting, but few have built the habit of finishing. Starting is easier than finishing, but the bulk of the results we seek, lie at the finish line.
The process of building the habit of finishing, is just like any other habit. First, you start small and build up, with a reasonable expectation of how long it will take to form a habit.
Then, you can make small changes to your environment to make it easier to finish whatever you set out to do.
5. Practice Quitting.
Contrary to popular opinion, the most productive, successful people, quit on their goals all the time ‚Äî they just know what to quit and when to do so.
The upside of quitting is that you redirect time and energy wasted on an unfruitful idea or goal, towards another more rewarding venture.
Here‚Äôs a quick inventory check. If the costs of pursuing an idea has outweighed the benefits ‚Äî over a period of time ‚Äî perhaps it‚Äôs time to consider cutting your losses. Although it may hurt at first, down the line, you‚Äôll free up more time to focus on better ideas.
Whilst it can be exciting to start new ideas and goals, if we don‚Äôt finish what we start, valuable time and energy ‚Äî that can‚Äôt be recovered ‚Äî will go to waste.
Falling in love with starting is easy. Falling in love with finishing is hard. But, if you can learn to fall in love with the art of finishing ‚Äî and the process of overcoming adversity, failures and working around obstacles ‚Äî you‚Äôll consistently follow through on your ideas.

Shaqir Hussyin|4|9|https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/growth-hacking-your-coaching-or-consulting-business-in-10-steps-feeb7f3764d8?source=---------4---------------------|Growth Hacking Your Coaching Or Consulting Business In 10 Steps|"Over the past few years, I‚Äôve built more than ten businesses to upwards of $1,000.00+ each.
Through the blood, sweat, and tears I‚Äôve learned what works and what doesn‚Äôt for massively growing your income.
Now if you‚Äôre struggling to hit your income goals, I want you to read this article carefully and please memorize this list.
If I knew the information that‚Äôs in this article when I first started I would be making millions a month, instead of just $200k.
Here are the 10 rules your company must live and die by.
One of the fastest things you can do to kill your coaching practice is to focus on what‚Äôs trendy. Three years ago, everyone was talking about blogging. Two years ago, it was branding. Last year, it was Facebook ads. Next year, it will be something else.
For every trend, two dozen consultants popped up claiming to be experts. Where are they now? Probably working at Starbucks.
Don‚Äôt try to teach the trendy thing. Don‚Äôt sell something just because it‚Äôs marketable. Find your ONE area of mastery where you can say you‚Äôre the best in the world...and don‚Äôt do ANYTHING else.
When you can specifically define and execute on what your amazing at, you‚Äôll start making 7-figures a year doing what you love. That is it.
Another trap is to get overly excited about your ‚Äústuff‚Äù. Here‚Äôs the truth: Nobody wants a revolutionary 3-step process for better relationships. They want to not be alone for the rest of their lives.
Nobody wants a proprietary algorithm for deploying the perfect marketing campaign. They want to stop worrying about money so they can sleep at night.
What is the problem you are solving?
What are all the horrendous costs of NOT solving it?
How does this problem effect your clients‚Äô confidence?
Their finances?
Their relationships?
Their families?
The more deeply and clearly you understand the pain that your clients are in, the easier it will be to get them to invest with you.
You can‚Äôt depend on word-of-mouth to grow your business. You can‚Äôt depend on referrals.
To make 7-figures a year as a coach, you need a system that works on autopilot and creates a constant flow of new clients into your business.
Our system is very simple:
Then they get superb results.
It‚Äôs simple. It‚Äôs predictable. It only has FOUR steps.
It brings back $20 for every $1 we spend on advertising. If we spend $1,000 a month, we make $20,000. If we invest $10,000 in a month, we make $200,000.
Because of that we NEVER have to worry where the next client is going to come from.
When you understand the pain you‚Äôre helping your clients to escape, you begin to realize that what you have to offer is PRICELESS.
Quick example: as I write this, I‚Äôm sitting on a Herman Miller Embody chair. It cost $1,400.
This is an absurd amount of money to spend on a simple office chair. Especially when a quality alternative can be had for a couple hundred bucks.
I could have paid $100 for a chair, but I was HAPPY to pay $1,400 instead!
So why did I buy it?
It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm a chair snob. It‚Äôs because the man at the store assured me that this chair would put an end to my back pain. And it has.
Spending $1,400 on an office chair is insane. Spending $1,400 to relieve your neck and back pain forever is a NO-BRAINER.
No matter how much competition you have, it‚Äôs nothing like the competition that rages in the world of office chairs. There are HUNDREDS of alternatives to choose from.
And yet I chose one that was orders of magnitude more expensive than it‚Äôs competitors because it SOLVED a very specific and painful problem.
The more you build all your marketing around THAT, the more your competition becomes irrelevant.
It‚Äôs standard in the coaching and consulting industry for about 20% of clients to get results.
This is an abomination.
When a client decides to invest with us, we don‚Äôt screw around. We go straight to work, and we measure EVERYTHING:
How many leads are our clients generating?
How many new clients?
How high have they been able to raise their prices?
How much has their net worth increased? How much more free time do they have to enjoy their lives?
If you‚Äôre not measuring client results, you‚Äôre wasting their time and yours.
Here‚Äôs the trick. It‚Äôs not about INFORMATION. It‚Äôs about TRANSFORMATION:
When you sign up to work with us, we don‚Äôt just dump information on you and send you on your way. We kick your ass until you get RESULTS.
It costs us more money. It costs us more energy. But at the end of the day, results are the only thing we care about.
That‚Äôs what it takes if you want to build a million-dollar coaching business.
Getting results does not mean that you need to invest more of your TIME. Trading time for dollars will burn you out, kill your business, and place a permanent cap on your income.
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a consultant seeing clients one-on-one and charging $100 an hour. You may not realize it, but this ONE decision cripples your financial destiny.
Let‚Äôs say that you book yourself solid and see 40 clients a week. You‚Äôre now earning $4,000 a week, or $12,000 a month.
That may seem like decent money, but what is the price you‚Äôre paying? Keeping up that workload is IMPOSSIBLE.
You‚Äôll have no life. No free time. And you WILL start to subconsciously sabotage your business.
Your clients will suffer too, because they‚Äôre not getting the best you have to offer. They‚Äôre getting a burnt-out, overworked mentor who just wants the day to end.
It doesn‚Äôt have to be that way.
What would happen if, instead of seeing clients one-on-one, you packaged your knowledge into a short-term, intensive group workshop?
Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done:
A short-term, results-oriented group workshop like this will get BETTER results for your clients than seeing them one-on-one.
Your CLIENTS win because the group dynamic will force everyone to push themselves harder and get extraordinary results.
YOU win because now you have LEVERAGE.
You can sell this group workshop for $2,000 ‚Äî $10,000 per spot. Your TOTAL time investment to deliver it is about 3 hours per WEEK. (90 minutes spent on training every Monday, and 90 minutes spent on Q&A every Tuesday).
Enroll 10 people per month at $5,000 each and you‚Äôre bringing in $50,000 a month for a total of TWELVE HOURS of work a month.
With leverage you can build a 6-figure income, working part time.
Want more?
Start enrolling 20 people into the program. Now you‚Äôre at $100,000 per month.
Your workload stays the same no matter how many clients you have.
THAT is leverage.
The secret to our 2000% ROI from advertising is that we create the best webinars on the planet.
Webinars are lethal. They do the work of an entire content marketing campaign WHILE they make a direct offer.
It‚Äôs like this: Content marketing is huge right now. Everyone is frantically writing articles and blog posts just trying to get noticed. Maybe you‚Äôre doing the same thing.
Here‚Äôs a question, though: when is the last time you made a $10,000+ purchase because you read a BLOG POST?
My bet would be NEVER.
I‚Äôm an avid reader. I plow through about 3 books every week. I follow all the right people on Twitter. I read all the best business blogs.
And yet, I have NEVER given a dime to any of the authors of those blogs...and I probably never will.
Yes, a blog builds authority.
Yes, a blog builds an audience.
What a blog does NOT do is shine a light directly on your client‚Äôs biggest problem, while showing them a real solution, AND making a direct offer.
A blog does NOT put potential clients into a buying frenzy where they will move heaven and earth to work with you at the prices YOU want to command.
A great webinar does ALL of those things, WHILE delivering terrific content to your audience. Everybody wins.
Our latest webinar has brought in $706,600 in sales and counting in the past few months. That‚Äôs only ONE webinar.
Imagine what a great webinar could do for YOUR business.
(example: you can even create and sell courses ‚Äúhow to become an expert writer‚Äù)
When something‚Äôs not working in your business, you have 3 options for how to deal with it...
1) Live in denial. This is what most business owners do. If you‚Äôve ever seen The Profit on CNBC, then you know that when a business is failing, most owners bury their heads in the sand and wait for bankruptcy.
2) Solve the problem through trial-and-error. By far the most expensive solution. There is NO business problem you‚Äôre experiencing that has not been encountered and solved by someone else. If you choose not to learn from that experience, you‚Äôre wasting money and time.
3) Find someone who is ALREADY achieving the results you want, and spend whatever it takes to learn from them. This is the cheapest, best, and fastest solution. Even if that mentor is charging top-dollar (and they should be), it‚Äôs nothing compared to the costs of trying to solve the problem through brute force. A great mentor is like going from A to Z while skipping all the letters in between.
We take our responsibility as coaches and consultants as seriously as we would if we were heart surgeons.
If a client comes to us who‚Äôs business is dying, it is our job to tell them the truth: what‚Äôs causing the failure? What can they do to turn it around?
It‚Äôs not about judging. Everyone is human. Everyone makes mistakes. But if your business is not producing the results you want, then SOMETHING has to change. Sugar-coating the problem only makes it harder to fix.
And on the rare instance when you can‚Äôt help someone, TELL them.
This is a principle that should filter down into every ad you create, every presentation you give, and every webinar you produce.
In the 21st century, no one cares about titles and certifications.
The ONLY thing people care about is your ability to solve their problem. They‚Äôre suffering. They want to STOP suffering.
Can you make that happen or not?
The quickest way to prove that you can help someone is to solve SOME of that problem for FREE. This is another place where webinars excel. We can shine a light square on the problem, give some strategies for solving it, and then tell them how to work with us if they want more.
It‚Äôs called Results-in-Advance marketing. We don‚Äôt ask them to blindly trust us. We don‚Äôt ask them to take our word for it.
We sit them down and show them exactly how to fix what‚Äôs ailing them. And then we tell them how to get MORE help if they want it.
This beats the Hell out of titles, credentials, or a string of letters after your name every damned time.

A loyal, dedicated team produces better results than a stressed or disengaged workforce. And at the heart of this dynamic is trust.
In fact, a business with high levels of trust is 21‚ÅÑ2 times more likely to have high revenues than one where trust is an issue. Sure, ruling through fear gets things done, but employees will do the bare minimum amount of work needed to keep their jobs.
Smart leaders know that engaged workers bring creativity and passion to their work, which means more minds seeking more solutions to everyday problems. Building trust takes time, and while it should come from the heart there are specific professional techniques you can use to make it happen.
Becoming known as somebody who listens is a good start: when you listen, you show your employees that you regard them as more than just pieces on your own personal chessboard. Listening is the start of empathy, and a team that understands each other is a team that can solve problems together. Henry Ford rated the ability to see things from the other person‚Äôs point of view as one of the greatest secrets of success.
But a leader should also learn to let down their own guard. In the 21st-century leadership means narrowing the distance between yourself and others, not putting yourself on a pedestal. Hold regular ice-breaking sessions. Social events will actually stimulate the release of oxytocin in the brain, which is a trigger for ‚Äòcollective action.‚Äô
We‚Äôve created a guide outlining proven ways managers can build trust in the workplace. Choose the ones that work for you, and introduce them into your daily routine. Through the days and weeks you will feel your team begin to bond, and see the results in your productivity and revenue.
Ernest Hemingway once wrote, ‚ÄúThe way to make people trust-worthy is to trust them.‚Äù Demonstrate your faith in your employees and they will repay you with their dedication.

Noah Bradley|5.8K|20|https://medium.com/@noahbradley/how-i-became-an-artist-4390c6b6656c?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|How I Became an Artist ‚Äì Noah Bradley ‚Äì Medium|"I am extraordinarily blessed to do what I love for a living. Somehow in the last decade I‚Äôve turned a hobby into a profession and then into a lifestyle. While I don‚Äôt claim any profound wisdom nor that my path is the best one, I thought that some aspiring artists out there might be encouraged to see the road that someone else has taken.
I didn‚Äôt want to be an artist.
I wanted to make video games. I was a nerd. I took programming classes at the local community college when I was 14. I made art (and always had), but only as a hobby.
Most of my artistic interests at the time were in making pixel art ‚Äî primarily because I could use it in the games I was making.
I also found the ConceptArt.org forums (they have, notably, since taken a nosedive ‚Äî but that‚Äôs a story for internet-drama history). This was in their heyday when a slew of amazing concept artists and illustrators were active on there. I constantly browsed and posted. It was a goldmine of information and sharing. It was where I discovered that there were people out there who got to paint beautiful, amazing things and made a living from it.
I was also taking drawing classes at the community college. Painting classes soon followed.
In 2o06, shortly before my 18th birthday, I had a monumental week. With typical teenage audacity, I decided to figure out what I was going to do for the rest of my life.
Within a week.
I spent the week writing lists. Pros/cons. Writing about what I wanted in life. Sitting around thinking. Taking walks.
And eventually came down to a few distinct choices.
Obviously we all know what I picked.
The reason I decided to become an artist has nothing to do with what would make me the most money, or what I was ‚Äútalented‚Äù at, or even what I necessarily always enjoyed the most. It was simply something that, in my gut, I just knew was the right choice. Without anything better to go on, that‚Äôs what I relied on.
From this moment, the fear began. I have spent every day since, with some variance, utterly terrified of failing. Of not being good enough. Not making enough money to support myself. Being a horrible, embarrassing failure.
And it was this fear that propelled me to improve.
My first decision was where to go to art school. Incidentally, no one had told me not to go to art school at the time, so I started researching schools. I figured if I was going to do this, I wanted to do it right. So I looked up rankings and after tons and tons of research decided the Rhode Island School of Design was where I wanted to go.
I got in. Barely.
I was wait-listed. But eventually got the call that I had gotten in. Unfortunately, it included no scholarships at all. The entirety of the approximate $35k tuition would rest on my shoulders (not to mention living expenses). This was a financially tough time for my family, so every dime would come entirely from loans.
I wrestled with the choice as long as I possibly could.
And decided not to go. I would, instead, reapply next year after working on my craft and improving my portfolio in hopes of receiving a scholarship.
The first thing I did was sign up for a class at nearby University of Virginia to take figure drawing. I had never done any figure drawing beforehand and felt that lacking in my application.
Alongside this, I also began taking private lessons with a local portrait painter, Henry Wingate. He was trained classically and taught me many of these methods of slow observational drawing.
A year passed and it was time to reapply to RISD. I did a fresh set of their required drawings and sent in a portfolio of new work.
I still remember the day I got the letter from RISD. It was a big envelope.
I had gotten in with a $20k yearly scholarship.
The following months I would scramble to secure the student loans in order to pay the remainder of the costs. My parent‚Äôs financial situation, thanks to the housing crisis, was still bleak. So as much as they would have loved to have helped, it was on me (and the good people at JPMorgan Chase).
I made it to RISD. And then I worked. I mean worked. To RISD‚Äôs credit, they are wonderous at making their students work hard. My classmates and I put in insane hours working on our craft. If it takes ten thousand hours, then I was getting there as quickly as I could.
The year came to a close. I had made friends and did more art than I could possibly fit in this post. But the financial realities of staying for another two years were coming to the forefront. Tuition was rising and my scholarship was not. To stay would mean ending up with over $100k in debt.
So I left.
I transferred to the Virginia Commonwealth University. I had grown up in VA, so I was able to get in-state tuition. The school accepted me even before I applied. It didn‚Äôt have the prestige that RISD had, but I would be able to get a degree and continue my study of art.
During this summer before I went to VCU, something extraordinary happened. You see, I had spent the entirety of my artistic career avoiding landscape art of any kind. I found it painfully boring. I would even go to a museum and walk straight past all of the Hudson River School painters.
But this summer I actually walked outside with my paints. I did my first plein air work of my life. And I loved it. Every minute of it. The heat, the glare of light, the wind blowing around and bugs flying into my paint. Everything about it just felt... right. I had grown up in the woods of Virginia and it felt like a dream come true to get to create art and experience nature at the same time.
So with this fresh outlook on what sort of art I thought I should make, I went to Richmond to attend VCU. I made a new group of friends. And we were all given the assignments of filling up sketchbooks. While I had always had sketchbooks and filled them up from time to time, VCU was obsessed with them. Our professors made sure we were constantly working in them, grading us largely based on the number of pages filled.
Now I will take this opportunity to admit that I am not a very good draftsman. And despite filling a sketchbook or two mostly with line drawings, that didn‚Äôt improve all that much. So I started painting in them. I knew I could fill a page a lot faster with a brush than a pencil.
Besides drawing my friends, sometimes family, and often strangers, I filled up my sketchbooks with studies of landscapes (from life, the masters, and photos). I knew if I wanted to make good landscapes, I‚Äôd need to study them a lot.
But still, as any good artist does, I continued to work on my figurative skills. But during this time I noticed an odd sort of trend. People tended to say much nicer things about my landscapes than my figures. Particularly odd considering less than a year prior I had been adamantly opposed to doing landscapes at all.
But this wasn‚Äôt enough. I knew that even though I was learning and improving, I needed to work on my own as well. I needed to pursue the things I eventually wanted to be paid to do. So in my evenings, after I was done with classes and homework ‚Äî VCU, thankfully, had a considerably lighter homework load than RISD ‚Äî I would do imaginative sketches of landscapes. Ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours, you might have even called them ‚Äúspeed paintings‚Äù back in the day. But they were tools for me to learn how to develop an entire scene, color palette, and mood in a very short amount of time.
This was one of the most important exercises I have ever done. This is where I took the years of study and began really applying them.
People responded to them. A lot. But still, I knew that I had to do more if I was going to get paid to do this. Everything I did was unfinished.
I am an obnoxiously impatient person and I had a hard time working on a piece to completion. I would get sick of something and just want to move on to the next piece. Which is often what I did. So I was sitting on a pile of unfinished work and my junior year was coming to a close.
I buckled down and forced myself to finish just one piece.
I had done it. And I was proud. I had produced a piece that, despite all of the flaws I now see in it, is at a fairly professional level. The lighting is good, the composition is solid, the space and atmosphere is believable, and I had forced myself to take enough time that most things are decently rendered.
So during the remainder of my semester and into the summer, I worked on finishing my first portfolio of work.
This is the point everything tipped.
I had spent all of these years working to acquire a base of skills in art and at this point, I had done just that. I was far from being perfect, but I knew I had attained a professional level. And all before my senior year in school.
It felt amazing.
During September of my senior year I took a day or two off of classes to drive up to middle-of-nowhere Pennsylvania for Illuxcon, a fairly new convention for fantasy & science fiction illustrators. I had gone the year before and walked around, talked to a few people, and come away profoundly inspired by the amazing work I had seen there. It had been my goal to come back, get a table at their showcase event, and impress everyone. That was my mission.
And to some degree, I think I succeeded.
I came back with the portfolio you saw above and I did make a splash (giving away hundreds of free prints didn‚Äôt hurt). I went from entirely unknown to someone worth noticing. And the art directors noticed too. It was wonderful and exhilarating and I‚Äôll never forget the pure joy of that night, showing off my work.
All of this work led to my first jobs. There‚Äôs a little overlapping of timelines here, because the work started rolling in during the summer before my senior year and kept up all through graduation. So I was somewhere between student and professional for about a year there.
These were great.
Working professionally felt incredible. But I always have my sights set higher.
I wanted Dungeons & Dragons.
I had met with the art director, Jon Schindehette, at Illuxcon and received a very positive review. So I was hoping and waiting for the call. And one night, on the way out to dinner with some friends, I got the email. Jon wanted to give me some work.
Three commissions, in fact. The biggest one being a cover piece for their online magazine. Wow. Funnily enough, the brief was still titled, ‚ÄúSam Burley.pdf‚Äù, after the name of a fellow illustrator who I suppose was originally intended to do this piece. I did not mind in the slightest being the second tier artist.
The success with that piece and others led me on to being a consistent artist for D&D for the years to follow.
And still, during this time, I forced myself to continue producing personal pieces. Just for myself, my portfolio, and my own personal satisfaction.
This last piece is very important for me. Hope of Glory is a piece I used as the cover of a postcard mailer I had made up for one of my classes during my senior year (I did, sometimes, still do my homework). Among the many art directors I sent it to was the sole art director of Magic: The Gathering, Jeremy Jarvis, with a quick ‚ÄúWould love to work with you sometime!‚Äù scrawled on the back. Magic was and remains one of the most coveted jobs for fantasy artists everywhere. They pay well, have a huge fan base, and only hire very good artists. Plus it‚Äôs pretty fun.
And a month after graduation I got the email from him.
I am currently working on Magic card #69 for them. It has been an amazing road working with Wizards. They have been with me for most of my professional career and have served to constantly challenge me and give me room to grow.
Soon after graduation, I moved back in with my parents. I was doing well enough with freelance work that I could have made it on my own. But I had $40k in student loans that were weighing me down. So I humbled myself and moved back home.
I spent the following year working. A lot. Harder than I had ever worked before. Taking on as much work as I possibly could and pushing my skills to be the best. Somehow, some way, by some miracle, I paid off my loans in precisely one year, one month, and one day after graduation. Just past my (insane) goal of paying them off within a year.
But then I started getting annoyed. I got annoyed with how students are taught and with how art schools take advantage of eager young art students. I saw too many of my peers taken advantage of. They charge tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars and give very little in return.
So for one thing, I wrote that angry rant that a few of you might have read.
In 2013, I started Art Camp. It was designed to be a summer program that ran for 12 weeks and would teach students the very basic, fundamental exercises they should use to improve their work. They‚Äôre all of the exercises I had spent the last several years doing. I had seen so many students utterly confused as to how to improve. So I put together a little program to guide people through the process. And it blew up.
Like, a lot. I set out to get just 25 students. I ended up with hundreds.
I ran another course the following year and now my friend Titus Lunter is running his own art camp on my platform. Where it‚Äôll grow, I‚Äôm not really sure. But I hope it continues to help aspiring artists all over the world.
At the heart of my work has always been my personal work. And so in 2013 I finally told everyone that these pieces were part of a cohesive world. One that I call The Sin of Man. It‚Äôs a primal, fantastical world full of strange magic, weird creatures, and mysterious gods. I don‚Äôt know where this road will lead me, but I love making the work.
In the beginning of 2014 I got a couple tweet mentions from a beautiful Australian girl. Within just a few months I had moved to the other side of the world just for the chance to date her. She has encouraged me and inspired me so much in the last year and a half. She‚Äôs even a fantastic artist herself. Love ya, babe. ‚ù§
We have had a great time exploring Australia and New Zealand together and she has been a wonderful support as I continue to experiment and refine my craft. And I, on my side, get to see her grow into a professional artist herself.
The following is a sampling of some of the recent personal work I have completed.
Which brings us to now.
I get to travel the world with a beautiful woman, create art for a world of my own design, and help aspiring artists make better work. I can barely begin to express just how lucky I feel to have the life I do. I may have worked at it, but it‚Äôs hard to feel deserving of so much.
I hope that, in some small way, this post serves to encourage fellow artists on their journey. It can take a long time and seem hopeless. It can be exhausting, discouraging, even depressing. But if you stay at it, someday you will make it past those obstacles.
If I can leave you with one piece of advice that I have acquired over all of these years, it‚Äôs to always find some degree of pride in what you have accomplished so far. Be thankful for every accomplishment, no matter how small. Be proud of yourselves. Not to the point of pride, but rather to encourage and motivate.
Because if you just keep going, eventually you‚Äôll find yourself somewhere.

Use the Performance-Values Matrix to build an Outstanding Culture
Every time I walk into a new company I‚Äôm advising, I invariably encounter a set of noble values prominently displayed on the walls. The first thing I‚Äôve trained myself to do is to not take them as gospel, and instead carefully observe how people really behave, which will tell me the actual values I need to know.
It‚Äôs not that most companies are disingenuous about the values they espouse. One of Enron‚Äôs ‚Äúaspirational values‚Äù was integrity, which may have genuinely expressed who they wanted to be at the beginning. But over time, this proclaimed value didn‚Äôt reflect their ‚Äúpracticed values‚Äù which were revealed when they committed fraud.
Why does a gap usually exist between a company‚Äôs aspirational and practiced values? You would think that to alleviate cognitive dissonance, most employees would feel an inherent need to practice what they preach ‚Äî or are preached at to do. But to truly close the gap, you have to attack the problem at its root: The issue is that aspirational values almost always come from, and must be rectified at, the top.
According to the theory of behaviorism, no behavior will persist long term unless it is being perpetuated by either a positive reinforcer (providing a reward, such as a promotion or praise) or a negative reinforcer (removing a punishment, such as a probationary period or undesirable tasks). Thus, when companies start, leaders set the company‚Äôs values not by what they write on the walls, but by how they actually act. For example, do they stay late and burn the midnight oil? Or do they leave early to be with their families? According to social learning theory, these behaviors become socialized, and rank-and-file employees who take their cues from these leaders act, and react, accordingly. These are what‚Äôs called trickle-down behaviors.
As the company grows and senior leadership is not always readily observable, employees begin to act according to what their managers either actively reinforce through praise and promotion or passively reinforce by allowance. Over time, employees become aware of which colleagues are being hired, fired, or promoted, and why. Did Joe get hired because his references praised his incredible work ethic? Did Jill get fired because she wasn‚Äôt considered a team player? Did Jamie get promoted because he spent a lot of time socializing with company leadership? Hence, employees quickly learn the ‚Äúrules of the game‚Äù to survive and thrive at their company, and act accordingly, which may have nothing to do with what aspirational values are plastered on the walls.
Instead of letting your company become a corporate version of The Hunger Games, leadership should actively prioritize behavior that‚Äôs congruent with company values.
First, you must ensure that all final candidates live up to your company‚Äôs values. For example, I‚Äôve created an interview template to evaluate candidates on seven key traits: grit, rigor, impact, teamwork, ownership, curiosity, and polish. (I recommend you replace these with your own company‚Äôs aspirational values.)
Another key trait (or the lack thereof) has been popularized by Professor Bob Sutton at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The ‚ÄúNo Asshole Rule‚Äù dictates that no matter how great a candidate may be, being an asshole is an automatic deal breaker. The way this can be implemented is through what I call the ‚ÄúOne Red Flag Rule,‚Äù which is based on the observation that pathological traits are sporadically, not continually, expressed ‚Äî except in severe cases.
For example, a narcissistic candidate may not act arrogant all the time, but may express arrogant comments 10 times more, on average, than someone who doesn‚Äôt have this issue (e.g. a few times a day versus a few times a month). Thus, if a candidate can‚Äôt suppress making an arrogant comment during a 30‚Äì60 minute interview, they are likely to do this even more often when employed full-time.
Drawing on best practices espoused by a leading investing firm, Andreessen Horowitz, I conduct up to six reference checks per candidate to evaluate ‚Äúvalues fit.‚Äù
Nevertheless, evaluating these traits during a brief interview can be challenging and lead to an inaccurate assessment. This is why I recommend conducting thorough reference checks, based on research findings dictating that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.
A 300-employee San Francisco startup, Weebly, goes so far as to invite job candidates to work an onsite trial week, paid at fair market value. The reason is simple: It‚Äôs very hard to suppress values-incongruent behaviors when working closely with others for that amount of time. As Weebly‚Äôs CEO David Rusenko said:
No matter how good your interviewers are, any screener will result in false positives (people who you thought fit your values, but don‚Äôt once they‚Äôre hired) and false negatives (people who you thought would not fit your values, but would have if you had hired them). Companies that prioritize culture are willing to accept some false negatives in order to avoid false positives. If you get some false positives anyway, the solution, as entrepreneur and president of Y Combinator Sam Altman said, is to ‚Äúfire quickly.‚Äù Few people have the psychological wherewithal to resign of their own accord if they still want the job, but know they aren‚Äôt the right fit. That‚Äôs why baseball coaches have to pull starting pitchers out of the game when their performance declines, and substitute a relief pitcher instead. In the same way, it‚Äôs a manager‚Äôs job to be a good coach and pull people out, compassionately, so they can find a better fit in another role or company.
The major issue that I‚Äôve seen with startups is that even if they claim to have a ‚ÄúNo Asshole Rule,‚Äù they hardly ever practice it. Rationales I‚Äôve heard include: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve decided that we‚Äôre not going to fire him because he‚Äôs a high performer‚Äù or ‚Äúfor that one bad trait, he has four good traits going for him,‚Äù and, of course, the ‚Äú[data scientists/engineers/product managers] are hard to replace, so we‚Äôll make do.‚Äù
The best way to avoid this pitfall is to make values-congruent behavior a formal and prioritized part of your company‚Äôs performance management process. I‚Äôll share the system I designed and helped implement at my company. It starts with evaluating each employee on the Performance-Values Matrix. Whatever employee evaluation system you use ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs a formal annual review or regular one-on-ones ‚Äî employees should be evaluated on both their performance-based behavior and values-based behavior. Both should be quantified on a spectrum (e.g. a 1‚Äì10 point scale), but I‚Äôve simplified into a 2x2 matrix for illustrative purposes. (Note: I use gender-neutral language throughout this piece, but I use ‚Äúguys‚Äù in the matrix due to space constraints. I also usually use more PC terms, but the colorful language helps me cheekily make my point here.)
Incompetent assholes are not only low-performers, but their behavior is incongruent with company values. In this matrix, they are in the lower-left quadrant and thus can only earn 25 percent of the maximum employee evaluation score. Hopefully, there should be very few of these folks at your company, but occasionally a few will slip through the hiring cracks, or something may have happened that caused performance and values-congruent behavior to permanently degrade over time. Nevertheless, they sap overall employee motivation by not contributing equally to the workload and are toxic to company morale. Needless to say, incompetent assholes should be identified and fired as fast as possible.
Competent assholes are high-performers, but exhibit behavioral tendencies that are incongruent with company values. Given that ‚Äúasshole‚Äù is not a clinical term, I will define it here as someone who lacks empathetic behavior to the point that it causes interpersonal issues. The biggest mistake that I see companies make is that they retain competent assholes because they are seen as critical to the company or difficult to replace. However, by doing so, they not only passively reinforce the competent asshole‚Äôs behavior by tolerating and promoting them, but they implicitly send the message to the rest of the company that you can basically get away with murder so long as leadership believes you to be indispensable. You can imagine what kind of culture this creates over time. In contrast, using the Performance-Values Matrix, an employee who‚Äôs competent but a complete asshole can only earn 50 percent of the maximum employee evaluation score, given that the other 50 percent of their evaluation is based on their values-congruent behavior.
There‚Äôs a reason Professor Sutton called it the ‚ÄúNo Asshole Rule.‚Äù It‚Äôs because exceptions shouldn‚Äôt be made, otherwise it shows your values are merely aspirational. The solution for competent assholes is a tactic that I call ‚Äúremediate or separate.‚Äù Despite the fact that these folks are strong performers, it should be made clear that value-incongruent behavior is not tolerated and they will need to remediate their behavior in a measurable way within a given period of time.
Thus, competent assholes should be put on what I call a ‚ÄúValues Improvement Plan‚Äù (VIP). For this, 360-degree reviews ‚Äî from an employee‚Äôs manager, peers and direct reports ‚Äî are a great way to assess improvement, or else be separated from the company. The reason I like giving these folks a chance is that sometimes employees that aren‚Äôt entirely inflexible (or pathological) can improve when they realize that their job depends on it. Often times, this requires entering therapy or executive coaching with a skilled psychologist, which is worth its weight in gold if the employee is willing to change.
Incompetent nice guys and gals are the exemplars of your culture and are well-liked by almost everyone, but unfortunately are not high-performers. Like competent assholes, completely incompetent nice guys and gals also can only earn a 50 percent maximum possible employee rating. That‚Äôs because it is nearly as much of a sin to tolerate incompetent people as it is to tolerate assholes. Giving free license to someone to underperform just because they are kind or likeable sends the message that your company is not a meritocracy, and that it‚Äôs more important to be socially skilled (or at worst, be a brown noser). However, the solution here is different than with component assholes, in that the best solution is to manage or move them.
Incompetent nice guys and gals should be put on a traditional performance improvement plan (PIP), and skillfully managed in order to give them training and feedback to improve their abilities. When their incompetence stems from a fundamental disconnect between their strengths and their current role‚Äôs demands (e.g. mediocre social skills in a client-facing role) one solution I‚Äôve seen prove fruitful is to move them into a different role. (The person may be an analytical whiz if moved to a more technical role). Of course, if that is not possible or does not work out, they should also be separated from the company. Encouraging incompetent nice guys and gals find a position that‚Äôs a better fit for their strengths is, ironically, the nicest thing you can do for them.
Hopefully most of the employees at your company are both competent and nice; you must exhibit both behaviors in order to be in the top-right quadrant of the Performance-Values Matrix. Competent nice guys and gals earn up to 75 percent of the maximum employee evaluation score, and should be both praised and given the opportunity for advancement. But in order to set the bar high, employees should only earn the full 100 percent score if they exhibit both outstanding performance and value-congruent behavior. They are what Sarah Tavel of venture capital firm Greylock Partners calls the ‚Äúmitochondria‚Äù of startups, because they are the company‚Äôs power plants ‚Äî adding value beyond their job description by asking and doing what is best for the company.
Given how rare these individuals are, founders should go out of their way to attract and retain them. By building this designation directly into the evaluation matrix, outstanding nice guys and gals should be formally recognized and rewarded with raises and promotions. These are the current or future leaders of your company, and need to be nurtured and cherished given that they are the foundation for your company‚Äôs performance and morale.
Of note, while I distinguish between competent and outstanding nice guys [and gals] in the matrix, I do not do so for assholes. That‚Äôs because I believe it is nearly impossible to be an outstanding asshole. For example, there is a myth of the ‚Äú10x engineer‚Äù in Silicon Valley, where a truly talented engineer is 10 times as valuable and productive as an average engineer. Even if one engineer could possibly do the work of 10, if they are an asshole ‚Äî especially in a management position ‚Äî they will decrease the performance of the people around them to such an extent that their team‚Äôs net productivity will break even or be at a loss long-term.
When leaders become Machiavellian and hire and retain mercenary employees, they resemble a Hermann Hesse novel reaching ‚Äúthe ‚Äúplace on the journey where everything falls apart‚Äù and the company‚Äôs culture degrades. While company engagement scores typically decline as they scale ‚Äî given they have to hire quickly from a limited talent pool and are too overworked to fire quickly ‚Äî this does not have to be an inevitable outcome.
Culture can only improve when there‚Äôs a baseline of openness, where people feel they can come forward and share concerns or opportunities for people and teams to do better. If people don‚Äôt trust what happens after they give their feedback, then reviews will be ‚Äúpositive‚Äù and not provide any useful information. This requires both anonymous surveys and the promise that aggregate feedback is valued and will be acted upon.
So if you want your company‚Äôs culture to be congruent with those noble aspirations written on your walls, you must continually assess how well your employees are behaving compared to those aspirational values, and develop ways to bridge the gap between aspiration and practice. I believe the best way to do this is to directly reinforce value-driven behavior, including making it an integral part of employee‚Äôs reviews and weighting it as highly as performance.

Andy Raskin|55K|8|https://medium.com/the-mission/the-greatest-sales-deck-ive-ever-seen-4f4ef3391ba0?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|The Greatest Sales Deck I‚Äôve Ever Seen ‚Äì The Mission ‚Äì Medium|"A few months ago, my friend Tim took a new sales job at a Series C tech company that had raised over $60 million from A-list investors. He‚Äôs one of the best salespeople I know, but soon after starting, he emailed me to say he was struggling.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve landed a few small accounts,‚Äù Tim said. ‚ÄúBut my pitch falls flat at big enterprises.‚Äù
As I‚Äôve written before, I love helping teams craft the high-level strategic story that powers sales, marketing, fundraising ‚Äî everything. So Tim and I met for lunch at the Amber India restaurant off San Francisco‚Äôs Market Street to review his deck.
After loading up on the all-you-can-eat buffet, I asked Tim, ‚ÄúAt what point do prospects tune out?‚Äù
‚ÄúUsually a few slides in,‚Äù he said.
Intent on maximizing dining ROI, Tim went back to the buffet for seconds. When he returned, I pulled out my laptop and launched into a Powerpoint presentation.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù Tim asked.
‚ÄúThis,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúis the greatest sales deck I have ever seen.‚Äù
The sales deck I showed Tim came from Zuora, the IPO-bound Silicon Valley company that sells a SaaS platform for subscription billing. If you pay for anything on a recurring basis (e.g. enterprise software), there‚Äôs a good chance that Zuora facilitates those transactions.
I had received the deck from an ex-Zuora salesperson, who said it helped him close the biggest deals of his career. (I have no connection to Zuora, and no relationship with anyone who currently works there. UPDATE: Some current Zuora employees have connected with me after reading this.)
Abandoning his naan in a puddle of curried goat, Tim grabbed pen and paper and took notes as we ran through what made the Zuora deck so effective.
Specifically, we noted how brilliantly the deck led prospects through the following five elements, in precisely this order:
(The ex-Zuora salesperson asked that I not share the Zuora deck publicly, and I will honor that request. However, I found slides on Zuora‚Äôs website and SlideShare channel that exhibit nearly the same narrative flow; all of the images below come from those public sources.)
Don‚Äôt kick off a sales presentation by talking about your product, your headquarters locations, your investors, your clients, or anything about yourself.
Instead, name the undeniable shift in the world that creates both (a) big stakes and (b) huge urgency for your prospect.
The first slide of virtually every Zuora deck ‚Äî sales or otherwise ‚Äî is some version of this:
Zuora came up with the phrase ‚Äúsubscription economy‚Äù to name the trend in which buyers increasingly choose recurring service payments over outright purchases. Zuora usually follows that with a slide laying out the history of the change:
Note the subtle but important difference from what most pitch advice tells you, which is to start with ‚Äúthe problem.‚Äù When you assert that your prospects have a problem, you put them on the defensive. They may be unaware of the problem, or uncomfortable admitting they suffer from it.
But when you highlight a shift in the world, you get prospects to open up about how that shift affects them, how it scares them, and where they see opportunities. Most importantly, you grab their attention. As Hollywood screenwriting guru Robert McKee says:
All prospects suffer from what economists call ‚Äúloss aversion.‚Äù That is, they tend to avoid a possible loss by sticking to the status quo, rather than risk a possible gain by opting for change.
To combat loss aversion, you must demonstrate how the change you cited above will create big winners and big losers. In other words, you have to show both of the following:
Zuora neatly accomplishes this by documenting a ‚Äúmass extinction‚Äù among Fortune 500 companies...
...and then showing how the ‚Äúwinners‚Äù have shifted from product ownership to subscription services. Those include upstarts...
...as well as rejuvenated incumbents:
To bring the point home, Zuora asks the following:
Of course, by this point the common thread is already well established in prospects‚Äô minds: Winners adopt the subscription service models that Zuora supports.
It‚Äôs tempting at this point to jump into the details of your product or service. Resist that urge.
If you introduce product/service details too soon, prospects won‚Äôt yet have enough context for why those details are important, and they‚Äôll tune out.
Instead, first present a ‚Äúteaser‚Äù vision of the happily-ever-after that your product/service will help the prospect achieve‚Äîwhat I call the Promised Land.
Your Promised Land should be both desirable (obviously) and difficult for the prospect to achieve without outside help. Otherwise, why does your company exist?
After demonstrating that the subscription economy will result in winners and losers, Zuora presents this Promised Land slide, which offers concrete criteria for what it means to win in the subscription economy:
Note that the Promised Land is a new future state, not your product or service.
(Over lunch, I asked my friend Tim to articulate his Promised Land, and he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have the most innovative platform for ____.‚Äù Nope: the Promised Land is not having your technology, but what life is like thanks to having your technology.)
Your Promised Land is also crucial for helping prospects pitch your solution to colleagues after your sales meeting ends. In your absence, those colleagues will ask, ‚ÄúWhat do those guys do again?‚Äù Armed with a compelling Promised Land, your prospects are more likely to supply an answer that gets others on board.
If it‚Äôs not clear by now, successful sales decks follow the same narrative structure as epic films and fairy tales. Your prospect is Luke, and you‚Äôre Obi Wan, furnishing a lightsaber to help him defeat the Empire. Your prospect is Frodo, and you‚Äôre Gandalf, wielding wizardry to help him destroy the ring. Your prospect is Cinderella, and you‚Äôre the fairy godmother, casting spells to get her to the ball.
When you introduce your product or service, do so by positioning its capabilities like the lightsaber, wizardry and spells‚Äîas ‚Äúmagic gifts‚Äù for helping your main character (prospect) reach that much-desired Promised Land.
For example, above is the slide where Zuora talks about the structure of its customer record. Out of context, this detail would likely bore even the most technical prospect.
Positioned in the context of transitioning from an ‚Äúold world‚Äù to a ‚Äúnew world,‚Äù however, it‚Äôs the foundation for an engaging conversation with prospects‚Äîtechnical and otherwise‚Äîabout why it‚Äôs so hard to reach the Promised Land with traditional solutions.
In telling the sales narrative this way, you‚Äôre making a commitment to prospects: If they go with you, you‚Äôll get them to the Promised Land.
But the road to the Promised Land is, by definition, littered with obstacles, so prospects are rightly skeptical of your ability to deliver. The last piece of the pitch, then, is the best evidence you can offer that you can make the story you‚Äôre telling come true.
By far, the most effective type of evidence is a success story about how you‚Äôve already helped someone else (who is similar to the prospect) reach the Promised Land. Zuora has a set of customer success stories that sales reps draw on, and while they‚Äôre more elaborate in the actual deck, this testimonial captures the essence:
I also like this one, from an exec at NCR (a Zuora customer), which speaks more explicitly to Zuora‚Äôs stated Promised Land:
What if you don‚Äôt yet have a huge number of successful customers? Product demos are the next most effective evidence, but again, features should always be presented in the context of how they help a prospect reach the Promised Land.
Of course, successful sales rarely happen solely as the result of a great deck. In order for salespeople to be successful, the entire organization must align around the narrative about change, Promised Land, and Magic Gifts.
There‚Äôs no better example of that than Zuora. If you ever see a Zuora executive speak‚Äîincluding CEO Tien Tzuo‚Äîyou‚Äôll almost certainly hear about the subscription economy and the winners and losers it‚Äôs creating. In fact, that‚Äôs the theme of virtually all the company‚Äôs marketing communications and campaigns, as well as its public vision statement:
According to the ex-Zuora salesperson, this company-wide alignment around the story made him wildly successful:
Just three weeks after our lunch, Tim called to say he was seeing promising changes in how prospects at large enterprises were reacting to his new deck, which we drafted together based on Zuora‚Äôs template. For one thing, prospects opened up much faster about the challenges they were facing. Also, he said the new pitch was more effective at engaging CFOs and other senior gatekeepers.
Then, a week after that, Tim emailed with even better news: He had just signed the largest deal in his company‚Äôs history.
Next week, we‚Äôre headed back to Amber India to celebrate.

Preethi Kasireddy|70K|12|https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|Why I‚Äôm leaving Silicon Valley ‚Äì Preethi Kasireddy ‚Äì Medium|"Here‚Äôs something I never thought I‚Äôd say: this is my last week in Silicon Valley.
This post is a personal one. Rather than sharing insights on Blockchain or Javascript, I‚Äôd like to walk through my inner journey the past few years.
It‚Äôs a journey that‚Äôs left me itching for change ‚Äî and driving down to Los Angeles to set up a new home base is a big one!
I moved to Silicon Valley during the summer of 2012, a little over five years ago. I had just graduated college and serendipitously landed here because of a new job offer. I was eager and anxious to start my career out here and frankly had no idea what to expect.
As it turned out, I lucked out ‚Äî Silicon Valley is one of the best places in the world for entrepreneurs, engineers, and anyone bold enough to try and change the world through technology.
...This was a stark contrast to life in my New Jersey hometown, where most people went to the community college, pursued 9-to-5 jobs, and settled into comfortable lives by their mid-20s. There was very little space there for thinking big, or taking risks, or creating your own career path.
So, landing in San Francisco was the best kind of culture shock imaginable. Suddenly, I was surrounded by technology and innovation and immersed in a community where challenging yourself was actually encouraged.
The next three years of living in San Francisco had a path-altering impact on my life, as I began to learn that crazy ideas aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù for those of us willing to put in the work and take a few risks.
That first post-college job was as an analyst at Goldman Sachs, where I was able to learn how tech company financials work at a fundamental level through working with CEOs and CFOs preparing for IPO rounds and acquisitions. This was hugely beneficial when I later moved on to working with some of those tech companies directly, and planted the seeds of my interest in solving problems with software.
After a year at Goldman Sachs, however, I realized that a career in banking was not what I wanted long term. I wanted to go back to being an engineer as I had been in college. So I decided to go against the grain and say goodbye to a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù position. Where was I off to next?
Well, I was on the brink of leaving to join as a systems engineer for a small industrial startup in the middle of the country. But after a random cold email followed by a long series of unexpected events, I got an offer to join Andreessen Horowitz on the deal team. It was an opportunity I couldn‚Äôt pass up ‚Äî and thank God I didn‚Äôt.
I spent the next two years at Andreessen Horowitz, where I worked with and learned from the pioneers of the web, like Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, Chris Dixon, and many others. I saw thousands of companies come through the doors ‚Äî I saw their ideas, their teams, their challenges and their strengths. I learned the ins and outs of building a successful technology startup, and on the flip side, learned the common mistakes that lead to failure. Most importantly, I met incredible entrepreneurs who inspired me to also become like them one day.
When I left a16z, I made the transition to software engineering. I was young and wanted to go out and just build stuff for the world. You could say that I had ‚Äúentrepreneur envy‚Äù ‚Äî I was eager to build products day to day, and eventually start my own company. I‚Äôve written about my experience extensively in the past.
This transition was nothing short of amazing. I was learning and growing at a break-neck pace. I was passionate and excited by my work. Frankly, I was having so much fun being an engineer that not a single day felt like ‚Äúwork‚Äù.
But beyond just loving my work, I also felt empowered. Empowered to do things I never thought were possible before. Because being an engineer gave me freedom. Freedom to build anything I want, whenever I want and wherever I want. The freedom to learn how everything works at a fundamental level. The freedom to teach and empower new developers. And most importantly, the freedom to be a creator and literally, create something from nothing.
It was only after I left Andreessen Horowitz to return to an engineering track that my feelings about life in Silicon Valley started to change.
Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world ‚Äî Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea ‚Äî and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn‚Äôt the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening.
What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
This isn‚Äôt exactly a surprise, since one of the Internet‚Äôs core functions is to make access to knowledge available everywhere. I personally taught myself almost everything I know about programming on the internet (outside some fundamentals from Hack Reactor), for free. And I‚Äôm just one of thousands of learners using the Internet to access information that used to be limited to elite colleges like Stanford, Berkeley, or MIT.
These days, techies aren‚Äôt limited to Silicon Valley if they want to find funding and a community. Many other cities with active and relevant tech scenes have their own unique cultures, art, cuisines, and activities to offer.
Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I‚Äôm not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately.
What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story ‚Äî whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered... but within the Valley, you‚Äôd hear the same stories over and over.
Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I‚Äôd overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing ‚Äî the like-mindedness ‚Äî was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking ‚Äî group think as they call it.
Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.
This isn‚Äôt to say Silicon Valley hasn‚Äôt taught me anything important.
It‚Äôs been a perfect place to learn to take risks. A place to learn the value of creating your own path, and to prove to myself that I can do it.
While living here, I‚Äôve made a deliberate effort to say yes to my dreams. I wanted the freedom to build anything I want, and I earned that. I wanted to learn and grow as quickly as possible, and I‚Äôve proven that. I wanted to meet people from around the world and learn from them, and I got that. I wanted to find my purpose instead of following a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù path, and I did that.
Most importantly, I wanted to pave a path that is unique to me, and I‚Äôm doing exactly that. I‚Äôm only a couple years into it, and the future feels unlimited.
Looking back, when I left Andreessen Horowitz to pursue this path, I set out a three-part roadmap for myself:
I spent the past two years learning many different areas of programming (e.g. web development, mobile development, distributed systems, etc.) and various application areas (e.g. machine learning, blockchain, etc.). I purposely stayed broad and exposed myself to as much as possible, and learned to code things that interested me most. Eventually, I fell in love with blockchain development.
My fascination with blockchains started when we first made the investment in Coinbase at a16z, and ever since, I‚Äôve been keeping up with the technology and eventually joined Coinbase as a software engineer, which helped me further dive deeper into the space. After Coinbase, I continued to tinker and teach myself various aspects of blockchain, and now I‚Äôm at phase two, where I‚Äôm focusing on getting really good at it. The next step is to use my skills to ‚Äúbuild a world-changing company or something else entirely‚Äù.
Leading the path I want to lead doesn‚Äôt require me to be in Silicon valley anymore. I don‚Äôt need to be here to follow my personal roadmap. Having the freedom of an engineer to learn and grow as an entrepreneur, writer, and speaker has opened me up to a whole new world. It made me realize that I can be an engineer, entrepreneur, writer and speaker from anywhere in the world.
The world is becoming increasingly global. Silicon Valley is just one way of living. One way of thinking. One way of viewing the world. But there‚Äôs so many other ways. Because after all, technology is global, engineering is global, innovation is global and entrepreneurship is global.
It‚Äôs evident by the fact that we now see countries like India and China leap frog generations of western technology and even inventing their own ways ‚Äî take mPesa in Kenya, Paytm in India, or WeChat in China.
Moreover, it‚Äôs become easier than ever to connect with anyone thousands of miles away. Being physically present is no longer a requirement. I can code from South Africa and still ship a product to someone in Silicon Valley.
Beyond this, what really nudged me was when I realized that the blockchain revolution is global. I‚Äôve spent the past year doing research and development in blockchain technologies, and noticed that many cities outside of the valley, like New York, Berlin, Toronto, Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Bangkok, are making immense strides in pushing blockchains forward. Many well known projects and efforts to bring blockchain to the masses are being started from places outside of Silicon Valley. For once, I noticed that Silicon Valley isn‚Äôt the center of it.
So then a crazy idea came to my head. Can I leave Silicon Valley and still pursue my dreams? Can I still build a massive and world-changing company? Can I still make a big impact in this world?
The answer to that increasingly became a clear yes.
Of course, there‚Äôs a strong argument for staying in Silicon Valley. After all, this place has a massive network of entrepreneurs and people who ‚Äúget it‚Äù. This place knows how to breed amazing startups. Moreover, I‚Äôve personally built up a great network in Silicon Valley over the past five years. I could easily stay and lead a very successful life here, financially at least.
But frankly, I don‚Äôt want to. That feels a bit too easy. I‚Äôm young, passionate, and driven ‚Äî I can‚Äôt let inertia, familiarity, comfort or money hold me back from going on to to doing bigger and harder things. I‚Äôm going to challenge myself. I‚Äôm going to fight for my goals. To work day and night for them. And money isn‚Äôt going to get me any of these things.
Money has never been my main motivator. I left Goldman Sachs before my first-year bonus because I was too eager to sit back for two months hating my life, instead of starting my new career at a16z. Then I left an amazing career at a16z to go become a developer. Challenge and impact are what gets me out of bed in the morning.
I have this burning desire to do even more, see more and experience more, outside of Silicon Valley. When the opportunity exists to experience a whole new city and still do what I love, why not just go out there and try? Why not try to expose myself to ideas in a place where the opportunities are wide open? Why not meet other types of people, learn other skills, and live on the edge a little?
Here I am: ready to do exactly that!
Perhaps my feeling and frustrations towards Silicon Valley and San Francisco are merely a fact of being here for too long. Perhaps they‚Äôre just from me needing a change. Perhaps they‚Äôre just from finding my true calling as an engineer, builder, writer and entrepreneur and realizing that I can do that from anywhere.
I‚Äôm ready to pick up my bags and embark onto the next adventure in Los Angeles.
Am I scared?
Hell yeah I‚Äôm scared.
I know practically no one in Los Angeles except for a few college friends who I haven‚Äôt spoken to in years. While on one hand, this sounds scary, on the other hand, I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôm beyond ecstatic to get out there and build up my network from ground up, just like I have done for the past five years in Silicon Valley.
And the best part is, I can always come back here ‚Äî for a day, a week or a month. Silicon Valley is where my entire network is, and they aren‚Äôt going anywhere. If I come back a year, or two years, or even five years from now, most of them will still be here.
So why the heck would I choose Los Angeles of all places? Lots of reasons!
Of course, every city has it‚Äôs flaws. Let‚Äôs not even get into the traffic situation in LA ;)
As some of you may know, I‚Äôve been heavily focused in the blockchain space for a while now. I hope to share more details about my next project in the coming months.
In the meantime, look out for more updates from me, whether it‚Äôs posts to teach you blockchain, videos for my #AskPreethi series, or pictures of me sitting on Venice beach with my laptop being a nerd and coding üòé
Still here? Good! Here‚Äôs the mic. Have you ever made a ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù move to chase something you wanted? Tell me about it in the comments so we can keep the fire going!
Blockchain Engineer. I have a passion for understanding things at a fundamental level and sharing it as clearly as possible.

Do These 15 Things Immediately.|"Most people wish their circumstances would magically change for them. They don‚Äôt have the desire to become better themselves so they can proactively improve their own circumstances.
Unlike most people, who simply wait and wish for luck, you can seek to become the kind of person equipped with the skills and abilities to do brilliant things.
You can become the kind of person who does highly influential work. Your work can solve pressing problems, improve people‚Äôs lives, and get noticed by important people who share your work not for your sake, but for theirs! Sharing your work makes them look good because of how great it is.
The quality of who you are as a person, and the work you do, is completely within your control. But you can‚Äôt wish for it to happen. You must become the kind of person who naturally attracts the success you seek.
Here‚Äôs how:
If you don‚Äôt pay for something, you rarely pay attention.
Most people want stuff that‚Äôs free. But if you get something for free, you rarely prize that thing. You rarely take it seriously.
How much do you invest in yourself?
How committed are you to yourself?
If you aren‚Äôt investing in yourself, than you don‚Äôt have any skin in the game of your own life.
If you aren‚Äôt invested in your business, you probably won‚Äôt do high quality work.
If you‚Äôre not invested in your relationships, you‚Äôre probably more focused on what you can get than what you can give.
When it comes to self-improvement, investing 10% of your income on yourself will yield a 100X or more return on that investment. For every dollar you spend on your education, skills, and relationships, you‚Äôll get at least 100 dollars back in returns.
If you want to do something extremely well, you need to surround yourself with the right mentors. Anything that you‚Äôll ever do well will be the result of high quality mentoring. If you suck at something, it‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt received quality mentoring in that thing.
The best mentorships are the ones where you pay your mentor. Often, the more you pay the better, because you‚Äôll take the relationship far more seriously. You won‚Äôt solely be taking in that relationship. You won‚Äôt purely be a consumer. Instead, you‚Äôll be invested, and as such, you‚Äôll listen more carefully. You‚Äôll care more. You‚Äôll be more thoughtful and engaged. There will be higher consequences for not succeeding.
I invested $3,000 to get help writing my first book proposal from a highly successful writer. That $3,000 got me maybe 4 or 5 hours of his time. But in those 4 or 5 hours, he taught me what I needed to know to create an amazing book proposal. He provided me resources that dramatically enhanced and sped up my process. With his help, I was able to get a literary agent and eventually a multi six figure book contract.
Had I been overly concerned about the $3,000, I‚Äôm confident that to this day, I‚Äôd still not have written a book proposal. At the very most, I‚Äôd have written a terrible one. I would not have been as motivated or invested, so I would have been far more likely to procrastinate needed action.
If you don‚Äôt have much money, surely you can afford to buy a book. How much money and time do you spend on entertainment, clothes, or food? It‚Äôs a matter of priority.
It‚Äôs only when you invest in something that you have the motivation to make it happen.
Beyond mentorships, you should invest in education programs such as online courses, books, quality products such as food and sleep.
Your level of success can generally be directly measured by your level of investment. If you‚Äôre not getting the results you want, it‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt invested enough to get those results.
Your number 1 investment must be yourself.
Who you are determines:
Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find when you financially invest yourself in something. You become very committed to that thing. Economists call this sunk cost bias. But you can leverage this to your benefit. If you want to escalate your personal commitment to something, invest heavily in that thing.
Eventually, it will become a point of no return.
You‚Äôll become so fiercely committed that withdrawing will seem ridiculous.
Hence, you‚Äôll need to truly know WHAT you want and WHY (see #14 below). If you don‚Äôt know these things, then over-committing could be a huge and irrational problem.
However, if you are certain about WHO you are/want to be, WHAT you want, and WHY, then you need to invest yourself.
Most people are consumers rather than creators.
They are at work to get their paycheck, not to make a difference.
When left to their own devices, most people consume their time as well. It is only by investing your time that you get a return on that time.
Nearly every second spent on social media is consumed time. You can‚Äôt have that time back. Rather than making your future better, it actually made your future worse. Just like eating bad food, every consumed moment leaves you worse off. Every invested moment leaves you better off.
Entertainment is all well and good. But only when that entertainment is an investment in your relationships or yourself. You‚Äôll know if it was an investment if that entertainment continues to yield returns over and over in your future. That may include positive memories, transformational learning, or deepened relationships.
Even still, life isn‚Äôt purely about being entertained. Education and learning is also key. And although both are essential, education will provide far greater returns in your future.
The world‚Äôs most successful people are intense learners. They are hard readers. They know that what they know determines how well they see the world. They know that what they know determines the quality of relationships they can have and the quality of work they can do.
If you are constantly consuming junk media, how can you possibly expect to create high value work? Your input directly translates to your output. Garbage in, garbage out.
Just as a large majority of your down-time should be spent learning, so should a great deal of your ‚Äúworking‚Äù time.
Wealthy and happy people work to learn. Unsuccessful and unhappy people work primarily for money.
Only 20% of your energy should be spent doing your actual work. The rest should be spent learning, improving yourself, and resting.
It is by ‚Äúsharpening your saw‚Äù that you‚Äôll continue to become a better and more capable person. Thus, as you dedicate large portions of time becoming a better thinker, communicator, and better at your craft, the quality of your work will continue to increase. Eventually, you‚Äôll be able to charge VERY VERY high fees for your work, because no one else can do it like you.
When you prioritize learning and recovery, then during the hours you are actually working, you‚Äôll be in a deep flow state. You won‚Äôt be distracted like most people are when they work. You‚Äôre either 100% on or 100% off. While working, you can get more done in a few hours than most people get done in a number of days.
Your time is spent well because your priorities are clear, you‚Äôre well-rested, and your mind is stimulated.
In our media and information age, there are a million things you could learn. But if you don‚Äôt put that learning into immediate practice, it becomes shallow information.
Information and knowledge are two very different things.
Knowledge and wisdom are also two very different things.
It takes wisdom to determine what you should learn, why you should learn it, and when you should learn it.
Unless you‚Äôre invested, you probably won‚Äôt learn with the intensity needed to maximize that knowledge.
Unless you understand the value of your time, you probably won‚Äôt have the discernment to ignore almost everything while learning that which will bring the highest return.
When you learn something, you should get a return on that learning. Far too many people read books now just to say they‚Äôve read lots of books. If you‚Äôre not applying what you‚Äôre learning, your consuming and wasting your time.
Very few people create true wealth.
Even those who have high incomes are not truly wealthy. Most people‚Äôs lifestyles match their incomes. When they make more, they consume more. In fact, most people make money solely to consume.
Very few people make money to invest that money.
It‚Äôs best to think of your business as only 1/2 of your income equation. You have your business which brings income. Then, you have your investment entity to turn your income into even more money.
Like anything, how well you manage your money is determined by how well mentored you are. If you want to become brilliant with money, invest in education and mentoring.
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The best time to start investing was also in the past. If you haven‚Äôt started yet, don‚Äôt sit and wallow in regret. Tomorrow doesn‚Äôt exist for people who don‚Äôt do something today.
Start today. Get yourself educated. Create a vehicle, or several vehicles, where you put at least 10% of your income. Eventually, your investment vehicle may even start producing more profits for you than your actual business.
Compound interest is a real thing. If you put 10% of your income into your investments over a long enough period of time, you‚Äôll be set. Unlike the majority of high earners out there, you‚Äôll be able to STOP WORKING whenever you want, because your money is making more than enough money for you to comfortably live with.
Most people are only focused on what they can get out of life.
Me, me, me.
However, once you become more consciously awake to the world, your desire will shift from merely receiving to giving.
You‚Äôll realize that it‚Äôs actually far more satisfying to give than to get.Moreover, you‚Äôll be driven by a cause you fully believe in.
The truth is, you really only have 1 of 2 orientations towards people (and life).
Either you are in relationships as TRANSACTIONS, or as TRANSFORMATIONS.
Most people have transactional relationships. They‚Äôre focused only on what they get out of the relationship. It‚Äôs all about furthering their own agenda. It‚Äôs rooted in scarcity. It‚Äôs selfish.
This isn‚Äôt how you get far in relationships and life.
It‚Äôs also how you get stuck in your own small-mindedness.
Transformational relationships, on the other hand, are completely focused on giving and gratitude ‚Äî the hallmarks of abundance. In these relationships, the whole becomes more than the sum of parts. Both parties, in vulnerability and trust, transcend their own small-mindedness and become something more.
At the core, this requires being a giver, not a taker. As Adam Grant has explained in his book, Give and Take, when two givers come together, the results are astronomical.
Here‚Äôs a pro-tip: don‚Äôt surround yourself with takers.
When your motivation is to give, you‚Äôll often get insights about how you can improve your relationships. Random thoughts will pop into you head to send ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù texts to various people.
You‚Äôll have more ideas about how you can improve other people‚Äôs lives and businesses.
You‚Äôll start contributing more, which will lead to far more opportunities and deeper relationships. People will come to love and trust you. Your work will be motivated by a higher cause and thus will be far more inspired and impactful.
Just because your primary motivation is to give, doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt also seek a lot of help.
Actually, you are constantly seeking and receiving help.
The truth is, everyone is highly dependent on other people to do what they do. But it takes wisdom and humility to openly acknowledge that dependence. Rather than seeing it as a weakness, realize that it‚Äôs a strength.
Beyond acknowledging your dependence, constantly express your appreciation to the people in your life. That which you appreciate, appreciates. Relationships are assets that can and should grow bigger and better over time. As the brilliant entrepreneur Michael Fishman has said, ‚ÄúSelf-made is an illusion. There are many people who played divine roles in you having the life that you have today. Be sure to let them know how grateful you are.‚Äù
If you don‚Äôt appreciate and give to your relationships, your relationships will suffer. All relationships are like bank accounts, and if one person is constantly depositing and the other person is constantly withdrawing, eventually all of the resources become depleted.
In such relationships, 1+1=less than 2.
Conversely, in synergistic and healthy relationships, 1+1= far more than 2. When two people are continually giving and receiving, the relational bank account continues to grow and expand, providing several intended and unintended benefits.
For example, I was recently at the gym with my brother. At the beginning of the workout, he was struggling mentally. He wasn‚Äôt adding to my energy and helping my workout become better than if I was alone, but instead, he was sucking my energy and requiring me to exert more energy and effort than if I was alone.
I made him aware of what was happening, and he immediately shifted his emotional posture. He realized how dramatically his mood was impacting me. His motivation shifted from consuming an experience to creating something great.
Our shared mental state heightened, taking us into group flow. Our workout become far superior to anything I could create on my own. Not only that, but we began to engage in inspired conversation. This led to brilliant insights and connections that were relevant to the book I‚Äôm writing.
The amazing workout was the intended outcome of our synergy. The insights for my book were unintended benefits. This can only happen when both parties are actively giving and receiving from the relationship. Where both are focusing on creating rather than consuming. Where both have the primary motivation of helping the other person succeed.
Most people are in a state of competition rather than collaboration.
Collaboration is a much higher level than competition.
Competition is focused on the self. It‚Äôs also very low level thinking, because what you can do on your own is very limited.
People who are competing are grinding. They‚Äôre more focused on winning than creating real solutions.
However, when your thinking becomes expanded, you realize you could do so much more with other people. Collaboration creates unique connections working by yourself never could.
You have skills and knowledge that are awesome in your field. There are other people in different fields who have skills and knowledge completely outside of your current awareness. These people also have assets you don‚Äôt have.
If you want to get 10X or 100X the results of other people in your field, you need to develop strategic ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù partnerships. This generally happens when you devise a plan where your skill sets and assets merge with the skill sets and assets of someone else.
What you can do well, someone else may struggle with. What you struggle with, others can do extremely well.
Who can you partner with that could speed your process?
Who has assets and resources you don‚Äôt?
How could you help these people?
What types of partnerships could you develop, that would allow you to more quickly achieve your goals and help them more quickly achieve theirs?
When you collaborate with other people, 1+1=more than 2. The whole becomes DIFFERENT from the sum of it‚Äôs parts.
This is how TRANSFORMATION occurs. Only those who engage in collaboration actually experience true transformation. People who only work well by themselves are stuck in their own narrow worldview and agendas.
When you merge with others, your ideas and goals change. They become bigger and better. They become DIFFERENT from what you could ever create on your own.
The only way to have these types of partnerships is to think long-term. You must be invested and have skin in the game. It can‚Äôt be transactional. It‚Äôs can‚Äôt be this for that. It must be about something a lot deeper. When it is, you‚Äôll have far more integrity in the work you do. You‚Äôll express greater appreciation. You‚Äôll consistently do the right thing, even if that right thing is difficult and uncomfortable.
Don‚Äôt seek transactional relationships. Only seek long-term TRANSFORMATIONAL relationships.
Look at your current goals.
Why is that your metric for ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù?
Why is that your target?
What would happen if, in all seriousness, you 10X‚Äôd that target?
What if rather than earning $3,000/month, you pursued $30,000/month?
Is that even possible?
Of course it‚Äôs possible. There‚Äôs several people doing it.
The only difference between them and you is their education, relationships, and strategy.
When you set a 10X goal, you‚Äôre required to think very differently about your daily behaviors. You‚Äôre required to be more serious in all aspects of your life. You‚Äôre required to eliminate limiting thinking and consumptive distractions.
Setting a 10X goal will be one of the best things you‚Äôve ever done for yourself. This goal should be created while you are in a peak state. You get into a peak state by doing something powerful, whether that be exercising, learning, or being in a unique environment, such as a foreign country. You can even get into a peak state by being around certain types of people, the ones who inspire you to be the best version of yourself.
Only you know what gets you into a peak and passionate state. So, do whatever it is that gets you there, and then write down your goals. Declare what you‚Äôre going to do. Then write that goal down and visualize it‚Äôs achievement every single day until it becomes your reality.
When you think about this goal, don‚Äôt deviate from the natural flow of ideas that follow.
You can‚Äôt 10X your results by engaging in the same thinking and behaviors you‚Äôre currently performing. Consequently, while thinking about your goal, you‚Äôll also get ideas about what you need to do, realistically, to achieve that goal.
Chances are, you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know. So you‚Äôll need to start really educating yourself about how you could conceivably achieve your goal.You‚Äôll need to get bolder about the work you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôll need to create more, and fail more. Over and over, in fact. Quantity is often the fastest path to quality.
Not only that, but when you think about your 10X goal, you‚Äôll probably have ideas that scare you. When you do work that scares you, you cross a boundary that most people never cross. Scary work is often highly profitable and valuable work.
Marketing is nothing more than applied psychology.
It‚Äôs about connecting with people, persuading them, and helping them.
Many people think marketing is a nasty or immoral thing.
Many ‚Äúartists‚Äù don‚Äôt learn marketing because they don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúsell out.‚Äù They want their work to be pure.
Academics are not better. Their work is not accessible to the common man.
Marketing is nothing more than making your work easier and better to find and use.
People aren‚Äôt magically going to appear and buy your stuff.
People aren‚Äôt going to magically appear and read your stuff.
Even right now: How did you land on this page? Look at the title of this article. I could have just as easily called it, ‚ÄúAdvice for becoming successful.‚Äù
But would you have clicked on that article?
Probably not.
But you clicked on this one.
Why did you click on this one?
How did you get this far down?
Think about the experience.
Marketing is the ‚ÄúHOW‚Äù to whatever it is you do.
The reason most people aren‚Äôt successful is because they either fear or avoid marketing. For the same reason, most people are bad teachers. They‚Äôre more focused on content than the delivery and design of that content.
But the delivery ‚Äî the HOW ‚Äî is just as important IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT than WHAT you‚Äôre doing or WHY you‚Äôre doing it.
You could have the cure for cancer. But if you don‚Äôt market it well, you‚Äôll never get your cure out there.
You could have the world‚Äôs most important message, or greatest story, but no one will see it if you don‚Äôt promote and package it intelligently.
Founder of the exclusive entrepreneurial coaching platform, Strategic Coach, Dan Sullivan distinguishes between those who are in the ‚ÄúTime-and-Effort Economy‚Äù with those who are in the ‚ÄúResults Economy.‚Äù
If you‚Äôre in the time and effort economy, you are focused on being busy. You actually believe the amount of time and energy you put into something merits praise. Conversely, when you are in the results economy, you are only focused on achieving a specific result.
The bottom line is what matters, and thus, it becomes very important to find the most effective way to get there. This is a key difference between entrepreneurs and employees. As Sullivan says:
Most people don‚Äôt think in terms of results because their security is in a paycheck. However, when you shift your focus from how little you can do to how much you can do, you change how you work.
You start learning ways to accomplish more faster. You take on greater responsibility. You change your environment. And you also realize just how important sleep and rest are to achieving the highest possible results. Hence, you begin to take more and more time off and rest.
When you dedicate 80 percent of your energy to rest and self-improvement, then you have a lot of fodder and a very sharp saw to use during the time you‚Äôre actually working.
You‚Äôre thinking 10X bigger than everyone else. You‚Äôre operating under short timelines and high pressure. You can tax yourself to extremes while you work because you spend lots and lots of time resting and preparing.
The environments you work in should reflect the work you‚Äôre doing.
Doing several types of work in the same environment is ineffective. But people do it all the time. They sit in the same seat and mentally shift from one task to another.
A far better approach is to BATCH your activities and to do those activities in a relevant environment.
For example, when I write a blog post, I work in a quiet library where I have no distractions. Because my environment facilitates quality writing, and because I knew I‚Äôd be writing that day, I write a lot. It‚Äôs easier to write 2‚Äì5 blog posts in one sitting than to try writing one post at a time.
Ari Meisel, author and entrepreneur, batches his activities and alternates his environments to match the work he‚Äôs doing. On days he is recording podcasts, he goes to a studio and records about 5 podcast episodes in a single session.
On other days, he spends his whole day in meetings or on calls. He does this work at his friend‚Äôs apartment because it‚Äôs a much more engaging environment.
He also does a lot of writing, and does that at the SOHO HOUSE in New York City, because it‚Äôs a quiet environment with poor internet connection. The lack of connection stops him from surfing the web and even using his phone, because he has bad reception.
Success and wealth are not all about money.
There are a lot of people who have money and have little ‚Äúcapital‚Äù in the other key areas of their lives.
Money, obviously, is very important. It solves a lot of problems. It‚Äôs speeds processes.
But money is a tool. It‚Äôs a means to an end. For those engaging in work they truly believe in, money is simply a tool for doing more work.
What is your WHY for what you‚Äôre doing or pursuing?
How could you possibly know your why?
More importantly, how could you know your REAL WHY?
It‚Äôs actually quite simple.
But it takes some radical honestly.
There‚Äôs an exercise I‚Äôll walk you through to get to your WHY. And more importantly, once you know your deepest WHY for what you‚Äôre doing, you should operate FROM THAT STATE, not from your lower and base-level reasons.
When trying to understand why you do something, it‚Äôs better to ask ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù questions then ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù questions, because ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù questions tend to put people on the defensive.
Here‚Äôs a solid question you could ask yourself to understand your WHY.
What about ______________ is important to you?
Let‚Äôs say you want to start a business, or get a new cellphone, or go to the gym...
It could be big or small.
But put that thing in there.
What about ‚Äúgoing to the gym‚Äù is important to you?
Then, you just write the first thing that comes to your mind: because I like feeling good.
Then you take your answer, and put it in the same question: What about ______________ is important to you?
So, given the previous answer: What about ‚Äúfeeling good‚Äù is important to you?
A simple way to structure this exercise is shown in the images just below.
So, you want to try to go 7-layers deep. Once you get to layers 5, 6, and 7, you‚Äôre going to have to be really honest with yourself.
Usually, you can answer layers 1‚Äì4 with your head. However, if you‚Äôre being really honest with yourself, and I mean REALLY HONEST, you‚Äôll need to come from your heart to answer layers 5‚Äì7.
It‚Äôs at the deepest levels that you‚Äôll discover your TRUE WHY for what you‚Äôre doing. Even if that something is as simple as getting a new cellphone or going to the gym.
But you want to remind yourself of your DEEPEST WHY when you‚Äôre doing something. And you want to operate from THAT LEVEL, because at your deepest level, you‚Äôll be operating from your heart, not your head. Thus, your performance will be much deeper, more authentic, and powerful.
The stakes will be higher.
Suddenly, you‚Äôre not just going to the gym to ‚Äúfeel good,‚Äù but because you have a higher calling to perform and need to be as healthy as possible to make it happen (or whatever your deepest WHY is).
Your DEEPEST why will almost always expose something very personal about you, and about your fundamental beliefs about life.
You want to be aware of these things, and how/why they drive you to do what you‚Äôre doing.
If you truly go through this exercise in a genuine way, you should get some mental and emotional breakthroughs.
You should discover something about yourself, and why you are the way you are, and why you‚Äôre pursuing the specific things you are.
Know your why.
Then act from the DEEPEST and most powerful WHY you have.
You‚Äôll be far more brilliant at what you do.
In order to be successful, you must believe in something.
You must have a stand.
All successful people and brands have a clear WHY. As Simon Sinek explains in his book, Start With Why, people don‚Äôt buy what you sell, they buy why you sell it.
Apple is a great example. In all of their marketing, they don‚Äôt explain the technicalities of their products, they define and share their core values. They believe technology should be both easy to use and cool.
If you want to be compelling and interesting, you must truly believe in something. You must have a clear stand. That stand becomes your brand. It becomes your trademark. It becomes how you distinguish yourself from others.
When you have a clear stand and brand, you stand out. You are no longer neutral. You believe in something, and are fighting to make a specific change.
As a result, people will either love you or hate you. That‚Äôs what you want. Lukewarm means you have nothing to say. Lukewarm means you‚Äôre trying to appeal to everyone.
The riches are in the niches. Your niche is your audience. They are a small group of people who agree with the stand you‚Äôre trying to make. They are your evangelists.
If you try to appeal to everyone, your message, marketing, and products will be terrible. You won‚Äôt be clear on your why, and neither will anyone else. Thus, you‚Äôll be average like everyone else and your work won‚Äôt stand out.
Only people with firm stands get really really good at marketing. They care enough about their message to get it out there. They realize that the HOW is just as important as the WHAT and WHY.
Are you doing these 15 things?
How aggressively are you doing them?
Do you want to become a multi-millionaire?
Are you ready to think and act bigger?
You‚Äôve got this.
I‚Äôve created a cheat sheet for putting yourself into a PEAK-STATE, immediately. You follow this daily, your life will change very quickly.

Awoken from a nice long afternoon nap, the old crocodile glanced at the young crocodile with one of his reptilian eyes, said nothing and then fell back asleep atop the water.
Feeling frustrated and disrespected, the young crocodile swam off upriver to chase after some catfish, leaving behind a flurry of bubbles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show him‚Äù, he thought to himself.
Later that day the young crocodile returned to the old crocodile who was still napping and began to brag to him about his successful hunt,
Unphased the old crocodile again looked at the young crocodile, said nothing, closed his eyes and continued to float atop the water as tiny minnows muched away lightly at the algae on his underbelly.
Again, the young crocodile was angry he couldn‚Äôt get a response from the elder, and he swam off a second time upstream to see what he could hunt.
After a few hours of thrashing about he was able to hunt down a small crane. Smiling, he kept the bird in his jaws and swam back to the old crocodile, adamant about showing him who the true hunter was.
As the young crocodile rounded the bend, he saw the elder crocodile still floating in the same spot near the river‚Äôs edge.
However, something had changed ‚Äî a large wildebeest was enjoying an afternoon drink just inches near the old crocodile‚Äôs head.
In one lightning fast movement, the old crocodile bolted out of the water, wrapped his jaws around the great wildebeest and pulled him under the river.
Awestruck the young crocodile swam up with the tiny bird hanging from his mouth and watched as the old crocodile enjoyed his 500 lb meal.
The young crocodile asked him, ‚ÄúPlease... tell me... how... how did you do that?‚Äù
Through mouthfuls of wildebeest, the old crocodile finally responded,
When I was first building JotForm, I was a lot like the young crocodile ‚Äî believing that I always had to be doing something to get results.
Back then, if someone would have told me that I would see greater results by spending more time doing nothing, I would have rolled my eyes and continued to chip away at my 16 hour day of work.
I thought that in order to be successful, I had to constantly be building, working, growing and developing the next thing ‚Äî whatever that ‚Äúthing‚Äù was.
All of us have a problem with busyness. But being busy and being successful are not one in the same. And, I think if we were to make ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù more of a priority, we might find ourselves catching more wildebeests versus measly catfish.
It worked for me, and I hope it can work for you, too.
But, doing less or nothing at all is easier said than done, especially in a society that suffers from extreme busyness. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at our unhealthy obsession with staying busy...
Mankind has struggled with busyness since the beginning of time ‚Äî or at least since 425 BC when Homer walked the Earth.
The Odyssey tells the tale of the Lotus-eaters ‚Äî a strange people that slothed around all day long eating lotus and doing nothing. And, what was stranger than fiction was that these people were content with their lives.
Homer wrote that after some of Odysseus‚Äôs crew ate the Lotus-eaters Lotus fruit (say that three times fast), they became like the Lotus-eaters ‚Äî content, relaxed and a bit lethargic.
Terrified that if all of his men ate the lotus fruit they would be unmotivated to return home, Odysseus ordered the affected men to be tied to the ship benches and for the ship to set sail immediately.
It ‚Äôs interesting, Odysseus‚Äôs reaction to this feeling of ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù sounds similar to the Corporate CEO, the Startup Founder and the collegiate football coach we know today ‚Äî hardcore workaholics that despise anything that might allude to a sense of complacency.
Though, they of course are just the tip of a much larger societal iceberg that feels frozen with fear at the thought of doing nothing.
The world as a whole now measures value in terms of busyness versus quality of work. In many ways, it has become something of a status symbol to be ‚Äúbusy‚Äù.
How many times have you heard or had a conversation like this...
We‚Äôve grown to subconsciously measure a person‚Äôs worth based off how many hours they work, how much is on their plate and put simply ‚Äî whether or not they are running around like a chicken with their head cut off.
In Tim Ferriss‚Äôs 4-Hour Work Week, he pokes fun at this idea by facetiously saying that if you want a promotion, you should appear to be more busy by working longer hours, scrambling around and constantly answering emails.
But, sooner or later, all of us have to ask ourselves what our mission is ‚Äî is it to be the busiest or is it to make the most impact?
And, what‚Äôs fascinating is that when we look at some of the greatest minds to grace planet Earth, we see an interesting commonality ‚Äî they all make time for doing nothing.
Making time in your life to do nothing can be challenging ‚Äî especially during the work week where we are constantly pummeled and bombarded with meetings, notifications and an ever growing list of tasks.
Busy founders have started implementing ‚ÄúThink Weeks‚Äù into their annual schedules ‚Äî week long periods they spend reflecting, reading, thinking and living outside the all-encapsulating world that is running a business.
While young founders like Skillshare‚Äôs Mike Karnjanaprakorn have adopted this practice, as well as big names like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Ferriss, it was Bill Gates who originally made the Think Week famous.
For many years while running Microsoft, Gates would retreat into week long Think Weeks twice a year ‚Äî not vacations, but actual periods of time dedicated to doing nothing.
Gates was so adamant about his Think Weeks that family, friends and Microsoft employees were banned. Today, Gates attributes much of Microsoft‚Äôs success to the big ideas and concepts he stumbled upon while doing nothing.
You don‚Äôt necessarily have to ban family and friends to retreat into a Think Week, though. Take me as an example.
Every year, I take at least a full week off from my company and head back to my hometown to help my parents with the olive harvest.
All thoughts of startup growth or conversion rates slip away when you‚Äôre picking olives. It‚Äôs meditative and calming.
I know that olive picking won‚Äôt land me at the top of TechCrunch, but it‚Äôs a personal measure of success. And somehow, some of my best ideas come to me during this period.
For someone who can‚Äôt take an entire week off of work once a year to do nothing, I recommend taking a slightly different approach ‚Äî embracing the digital sabbath.
On either Saturday or Sunday, force yourself to step away from all forms of technology ‚Äî a practice known as a digital sabbath.
Shut off your smartphone and hide it in your closet. Powerdown the laptop and slide it under your bed. And, try with all your might to refrain from binge-watching Netflix.
Give your brain space to think by stepping away from the daily grind and doing nothing. Your mind will have time to stumble upon new ideas and further process old ones.
You may find the success that results from this practice to be similar to that of the old crocodile at the beginning of this article.
While we tell ourselves we can achieve more by scrambling, sometimes it‚Äôs better to close our eyes and just float.
And, wait, until the wildebeest shows up.

Aytekin Tank|79K|7|https://medium.com/swlh/why-you-shouldnt-share-your-goals-be13fbe352d2?source=tag_archive---------7---------------------|Why you shouldn‚Äôt share your goals ‚Äì The Startup ‚Äì Medium|"The race to get the world‚Äôs first plane in the sky was a hard fought battle between The Wright Brothers and a lesser-known gentleman by the name of Samuel Pierpont Langley.
You will discover why you‚Äôve never heard of the latter here shortly.
As you probably read somewhere inside that history textbook you were forced to lug around through elementary ‚Äî The Wright Brothers were responsible for creating the first successful airplane. You remember how the story goes...
While today ‚ÄúThe Wright Brothers‚Äù is the first name that comes to anyone‚Äôs mind when they hear the word fly, once upon a time the pair were major underdogs.
In fact, during the race to the sky, most of America had its money on the man I mentioned earlier, Langley.
He was an extremely outspoken astronomer, physicist and aviation pioneer who was on a mission to make history. Langley‚Äôs high stature as the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution gave him both the credibility and hype he needed to get America on his side.
Not to mention, he was extremely well-backed by the War Department who contributed $50,000 to help him be the first to get a bird in the sky.
Long story short, despite all the hype, Langley‚Äôs flying machine ended up crashing and burning while The Wright Brother‚Äôs plane ended up soaring.
One party had the entire world, vast resources and plenty of moolah on his side, while the other just had a small bike shop and a passion to fly.
So, let me ask you this... can you guess why The Wright Brothers achieved their goal to take flight while Langley failed?
The Wright Brothers victory over Langley came down to passion, intrinsic motivation (Langley was very status driven) and perhaps praise.
While Langley was sharing his ambitions with the world and being heavily praised for feats he had not yet achieved, The Wright Brothers were receiving little to no attention whatsoever.
Some experts argue that early praise can leave the individual receiving the praise feeling like he or she has already won... in turn causing them to be less likely to follow through with their goals.
For example, in Peter Gollwitzer‚Äôs research article, When Intentions Go Public, he raises this very question:
Gollwitzer and his team of researchers carried out a handful of studies, here is a brief excerpt from their findings:
‚ÄúOther people‚Äôs taking notice of one‚Äôs identity-relevant intentions apparently engenders a premature sense of completeness regarding the identity goal.‚Äù
In English, what Gollwitzer found was that when individuals set a goal that is closely tied to their identity and then share their intentions with others, they are less likely to achieve the goal.
For example, if your goal is to start drinking more water and you tell your friends and family that you‚Äôre going to start drinking more water, this would probably have little to no impact on whether or not you actually drink more water.
Why? Because drinking more water isn‚Äôt something you hold close to your identity.
On the other hand, if your goal is to lose 40 lbs and drop 2‚Äì3 waist sizes, it might not be the best idea to post about it all over Facebook. Your appearance is something you very much so identify with. So, if you tell people you plan to lose weight and everyone tells you how awesome you are and how great you‚Äôre going to look, you might be less likely to lose the weight.
This finding is a bit counterintuitive, considering we were told by our teachers and coaches growing up to set our goals, share our goals, hold ourselves accountable.
But, the theory certainly holds some weight (pun very much intended), and is one that has been adopted by highly successful serial entrepreneurs like Derek Sivers, founder of CD Baby.
Sivers gave a TED Talk on this very topic nearly a decade back. To prove his point, he asked the audience to imagine how they felt when they shared their goals with others:
Sivers goes on to explain that it‚Äôs this ‚Äúwarm feeling‚Äù that keeps us from battling on to actually achieve our goals.
When we openly share our goals, we experience a feeling of success that normally only takes place upon completion of the goal.
The result? We don‚Äôt ever actually pursue the goal.
I‚Äôve recently shared 3 real-life business tactics to achieve your ‚Äúbig hairy goals‚Äù. But now, let‚Äôs talk about what can actually work when it comes to successfully reaching your goals.
For two counterintuitive yet effective approaches to this, we look to a philosophy called ‚Äúfear-setting‚Äù and making an effort to surround yourself with competition.
Entrepreneur, angel investor and writer, Tim Ferriss, gave an incredible TED Talk where he discussed how fear-setting is instrumental in achieving one‚Äôs goals.
He recommends that instead of obsessively sharing your goals, you should come to terms with all the fears that are preventing you from achieving them.
For example, let‚Äôs say your goal is to start your own business. Ferriss recommends that you write down all of your fears that are associated with starting a business.
These might include... ‚ÄúLosing all my money‚Äù... ‚ÄúGetting fired from my day job‚Äù... ‚ÄúGetting laughed at or judged if I fail‚Äù.
Once you write down these fears, you should then write down how you would go about preventing these fears (or mitigating the likelihood) of them actually happening.
For example, for the first fear ‚Äúlosing all my money‚Äù, your prevention might be... ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only going to invest $2,500 that way I can‚Äôt lose it all.‚Äù
Finally, after you have written down your preventions, you should then write down how you will repair what you fear from happening... if it actually ends up happening.
So, to repair losing the $2,500, you might write down, ‚ÄúGet a part time job as a bartender in addition to my day job until I make the $2,500 back.‚Äù
By concentrating on fear-setting over goal-sharing, it allows you to remove the fear that is keeping you from actually achieving your goals.
In addition to fear-setting, it might also be a good idea to surround yourself with competition.
A healthy dose of competition can be good for your business, too. At JotForm, we love to use competition to our advantage with events like hackweeks to achieve our product release goals.
A study published two years ago in the journal Preventive Medicine Reports, sheds some light on the impact that competition has on our goals.
The study put 800 undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania through an 11-week exercise program where each person was assigned to work out alone or in a team.
In addition, the teams were designed to be either supportive or competitive.
By the end of the study, researchers found that students involved in the competitive team programs were 90% more likely to attend their scheduled exercise sessions than any other group.
Not only is this number staggering, but it also proves that competition can create a higher level of commitment among people chasing down goals.
When you surround yourself with competition, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to share your goals with the competition. You don‚Äôt have to tell the other folks in the spin class, cross-fit training or pick-up basketball leagues that your goal is to lose 50 lbs.
But, by simply showing up and placing yourself in a competitive environment, you will be more likely to push harder and show up more often ‚Äî two factors that can help your reach your goals.
The science behind achieving goals has always been an interesting topic.
While some entrepreneurs advocate the idea that you should never have a goal, I‚Äôve recently explained why setting big goals can make you miserable.
Whether you decide to share your goals or not, what I‚Äôve found out across 12 years of entrepreneurship is that you should craft your own path.
What works for others won‚Äôt always work for you. And what works for you today won‚Äôt always work tomorrow.

SteÃÅphane Nasser|2K|9|https://medium.com/parisoma-blog/valuation-for-startups-9-methods-explained-53771c86590e?source=tag_archive---------8---------------------|Valuation For Startups ‚Äî 9 Methods Explained ‚Äì The PARISOMA Review ‚Äì Medium|"This article was co-written and published in French by Augustin de Cambourg, in Portuguese by Raphael Mielle, and in Spanish by Alberto Martinez de Arenaza.
A startup is like a box. A very special box.
The box has a value. The more things you put in the box, the more its value increases. Add a patent in the box, the value increases. Add a kick-ass management team in the box, the value increases. Easy, right?
The box is also magic. When you put $1 inside, it will return you $2, $3 or even $10! Amazing!
Problem is, building a box can be very expensive. So you need to go and see people with money ‚Äî let‚Äôs call them investors ‚Äî and offer them a deal that sounds a bit like this:
But how much should ‚ÄúX‚Äù be?
It depends on the Pre-Money Valuation, e.g. the value of the box at the moment of the investment. But calculating the Pre-Money Valuation is tricky. This article will take you through 9 different valuation methods to better let you understand how to determine Pre-Money Valuation.
The Berkus Method is a simple and convenient rule of thumb to estimate the value of your box. It was designed by Dave Berkus, a renowned author and business angel investor. The starting point is: do you believe that the box can reach $20M in revenue by the fifth year of business? If the answer is yes, then you can assess your box against the 5 key criteria for building boxes.
This will give you a rough idea of how much your box is worth (AKA pre-money valuation) and more importantly, what you should improve. Note that according to Berkus, the pre-money valuation should not be more than $2M.
The Berkus Method is meant for pre-revenue startups. To read more about the Berkus Method, click here.
The Risk Factor Summation Method or RFS Method is a slightly more evolved version of the Berkus Method. First, you determine an initial value for your box. Then you adjust said value for 12 risk factors inherent to box-building.
Initial value is determined as the average value for a similar box in your area, and risk factors are modelled as multiples of $250k, ranging from $500k for a very low risk, to -$500k for a very high risk. The most difficult part here, and in most valuation methods, is actualy finding data about similar boxes.
The Risk Factor Summation Method is meant for pre-revenue startups. To read more about the Risk Factor Summation Method, click here.
The Scorecard Valuation Method is a more elaborate approach to the box valuation problem. It starts the same way as the RFS method i.e. you determine a base valuation for your box, then you adjust the value for a certain set of criteria. Nothing new, except that those criteria are themselves weighed up based on their impact on the overall success of the project.
This method can also be found under the name of Bill Payne Method, considering 6 criteria: Management (30%), Size of opportunity (25%), Product or Service (10%), Sales channels (10%), Stage of business (10%) and Other factors (15%).
The Scorecard Valuation Method is meant for pre-revenue startups. To read more about the Scorecard Valuation Method, click here.
The Comparable Transactions Method is really just a rule of three.
Depending on the type of box you are building, you want to find an indicator which will be a good proxy for the value of your box. This indicator can be specific to your industry: Monthly Recurring Revenue (Saas), HR headcount (Interim), Number of outlets (Retail), Patent filed (Medtech/Biotech), Weekly Active Users or WAU (Messengers). Most of the time, you can just take lines from the P&L : sales, gross margin, EBITDA, etc.
The Comparables Transactions Method is meant for pre- and post-revenue startups. To read more about the Comparable Transactions Method, click here.
Forget about how magical the box is, and see how much 1 pound of cardboard is worth.
The book value refers to the net worth of the company i.e. the tangible assets of the box i.e. the ‚Äúhard parts‚Äù of the box.
The Book Value Method is particularly irrelevant for startups as it is focused on the ‚Äútangible‚Äù value of the company, while most startups focus on intangible assets : RD (for a biotech), user base and software development (for a Web startup), etc. To read more about the Book Value method, click here.
Rarely good from a seller perspective, the liquidation value is, as implied by its name, the valuation you apply to a company when it is going out of business.
Things that counts for a liquidation value estimation are all the tangible assets: Real Estate, Equipment, Inventory... Everything you can find a buyer for in a short span of time. The mindset is: if I sell whatever the company can in less than two months, how much money does that make ? All the intangibles on the other hand are considered worthless in a liquidation process (the underlying assumption is that if it was worth something, it would have already been sold at the time you enter in liquidation): patents, copyright, and any other intellectual property.
Practically, the liquidation value is the sum of the scrap value of all the tangible assets of the company.
For an investor, the liquidation value is useful as a parameter to evaluate the risk of the investment: a higher potential liquidation value means a lower risk. For example, all other things equal, it is preferable to invest in a company that owns its equipment compared to one that leases it. If everything goes wrong and you go out of business, at least you can get some money selling the equipment, whereas nothing if you lease it.
So, what is the difference between book value and liquidation value ? If a startup really had to sell its assets in the case of a bankruptcy, the value it would get from the sale would likely be below its book value, due to the adverse conditions of the sales.
So liquidation value < book value. Although they both account for tangible assets, the context in which those assets are valued differs. As Ben Graham points out, the liquidation value measures what the stockholders could get out of the business, while the book value measures what they have put into the business.
If your box works well, it brings in a certain amount of cash every year. Consequently, you could say that the current value of the box is the sum of all the future cash flows over the next years. And that is exactly the reasoning behind the DCF method.
Let‚Äôs say you are projecting cash flows over n years. What happens after that ? This is the question addressed by the Terminal Value (TV)
Option 1: you consider the business will keep growing at a steady pace, and keep generating indefinite cash flows after the n years period. You can then apply the formula for Terminal Value : : TV = CFn+1/(r- g) with ‚Äúr‚Äù being the discount rate and ‚Äúg‚Äù being the expected growth rate.
Option 2 : you consider an exit after the n year period. First, you want to estimate the future value of the acquisition, for example with the comparable method transaction (see above). Then, you have to discount this future value to get its net present value. TV = exit value/(1+r)^n
Although technically, you could use it for post-revenue startups, it is just not meant for startup valuation. To read more about the DCF method, click here.
The First Chicago Method answers to a specific situation: what if your box has a small chance of becoming huge? How to assess this potential?
The First Chicago Method (named after the late First Chicago Bank ‚Äî if you ask) deals with this issue by making three valuations: a worst case scenario (tiny box), a normal case scenario (normal box), a best case scenario (big box).
Each valuation is made with the DCF Method (or, if not possible, with internal rate of return formula or with multiples). You then decide of a percentage reflecting the probability of each scenario to happen. Your valuation according to the First Chicago Method is the weigthed average of each case.
The First Chicago Method is meant for post-revenue startups. You can read more about the First Chicago Method here.
As its name indicate, the Venture Capital Method stands from the viewpoint of the investor.
An investor is always looking for a specific return on investment, let‚Äôs say 20x. Besides, according to industry standards, the investor thinks that your box could be sold for $100M in 8 years. Based on those two elements, the investor can easily determine the maximum price he or she is willing to pay for investing in your box, after adjusting for dilution.
The Venture Capital Method is meant for pre- and post-revenue startups. To read more about the Venture Capital Method, click here.
Congratulations! If you made it this far, you know 9 valuation methods. So you must be screaming from the inside: what is the best valuation method ?!
First, keep in mind that the only methods really used by VCs are comparables and a rough estimate of how much dilution is acceptable by the founders ‚Äî e.g. giving out 15% to 25% for a seed round comprised between ‚Ç¨300k and ‚Ç¨500k, or making sure that the founders remain majority shareholders after a Series A.
Second, let us remember that valuations are nothing but formalized guesstimates. Valuations never show the true value of your company. They just show two things: (1) how bad the market is willing to invest in your little red box, and (2) how bad you are willing to accept it.
Having said that, I find that the best valuation method is the one described by Pierre Entremont, early-stage investor at Otium Capital, in this excellent article. According to him, you should start from defining your needs and then negotiate dilution:
Valuations are a good starting point when considering fundraising. They help builing up the reasoning behind the figures and objectify the discussion. But in the end, they are just the theoretical introduction to a more significant game of supply and demand.

Luckily, my initial hyperoptimism buoyed me whilst, oscillating between euphoria and despair, I was slowly but systematically forced off The Magic School Bus and onto the S.S. Battleship Long Haul.
I was a quick and eager learner, but despite the hours of webinar watching, countless Friday nights pumping out site copy, and teaching myself everything I could about HTML, there were just some things I didn‚Äôt get. I had to fall on my ass to procure the ‚Äúmaster‚Äôs degree in life survival‚Äù every entrepreneur earns on their ‚Äújourney.‚Äù (Yes, those are bitterly gesticulated air quotes.)
Here are 11 things I wish I knew when I started my business. I hope they will save you some time, and at the very least, some anguish because ‚Äî experience is a good teacher here ‚Äî the sodium from your tears acts as a corrosive melting agent on all brands of premium ice cream (though it does make a superb saline for your dirty martini). Cry over a cup, oh fathomless bird of preneurial gumption!
Your success (and financial stability) will come from expertly running your business ‚Äî not writing copy, rebranding your client‚Äôs website, teaching yoga, podcasting, or making jewelry. In other words, you will spend 15 percent of your time doing what you love (your gift, in my case coaching and writing) and 85 percent marketing, administrating, selling, strategizing, and answering a shitload of email. Survival will hinge on how quickly you adopt this role of business owner first, creator of pretty things second.
This sucked for me because I wanted nothing to do with running a business. I just wanted to be a writer and a life coach who wrote and coached all day. I didn‚Äôt get it.
Entrepreneurship is the most life-changing relationship (like marriage or parenthood) that a person can have. You will be confronted overandoverandover with your fears, insecurities, crappy excuses, limitations, justifications, shitty integrity, and inefficient time management. The standard you held yourself to in the workaday world was good enough then, but it won‚Äôt be good enough to run your own business.
You will learn to accept yourself through all this because, in order to get up every day and create a profit, you will have to. Somehow, through that process of acceptance, while you‚Äôre busy putting yourself out there in spite of your flaws, your weaknesses will transform into assets. Slowly but surely, you will fall in love with yourself. Not in the over-hyped ‚ÄúSelf Love 2018‚Äù way, but in a quiet way that sneaks up on you after witnessing a thousand splinter-sized moments of transcending the baser aspects of yourself.
I heard the ‚Äútwo-year rule‚Äù when I started my biz, but I was confident I could do it in six months. I believed with every fiber of my glittery, go-gettin‚Äô heart that my work ethic (15-hour days, seven days a week) ‚Äî along with my talent, skills, and personal magic ‚Äî could rip a path to accelerated success. This was a leap of faith, one that was worth some express lane juju points from Heaven.
Jesus had other plans.
You won‚Äôt expect it, because you prepared for the long haul. You secured a business loan, or got some investors, or sold your house (cough, cough), or have one year‚Äôs worth of savings and have planned accordingly.
But then all of the sudden, amidst the puffy clouds and blue skies, your little twin engine Entreprenairplane will sputter, the needle on the gas gauge unexpectedly plummeting to zero, and you will only have one choice: land your plane on the wild, abandoned air strip called Bank Balance: 14 Dollars. And this will be the last place you ever thought you‚Äôd crash land, because didn‚Äôt you pass this test on No More Sephora Island?
The good news is this is a rite of passage that will launch you into the League of Business Badassery in which, once you are out of the money hellhole, you will be unstoppable. You‚Äôve been to the baddest prison there is, looked down the barrel of your worst fear, and stood your ground. You didn‚Äôt quit. You got up the next day, and you wrote your next post, created your next offering, and answered the email with zero dollars in your bank account.
There is nothing more beautiful than running out of money and realizing that you are doing your work because you‚Äôve got the guts to push through your worst fears when there is no evidence of security. You really, truly love what you do, and you‚Äôd do it for free if you had to. Irony is a sassy bitch, isn‚Äôt she?
Take a second job if it will give you peace of mind. Please don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre failing at your business ‚Äî learn from my mistake. I was so resistant to ‚Äúdividing my focus‚Äù or taking any action which I interpreted as undermining my commitment to being a successful writer and coach. Do you see the hellish mousetrap that was? I really thought that by making a Plan B, I was telling the Universe I wasn‚Äôt 100 percent serious about my success. I created a worse problem by allowing financial stress to gut me of my sanity.
If having a steady stream of part-time income would be in service to your peace of mind, do it.
I finally came to terms with the fact that I was being obnoxiously naiÃàve about how money, peace, survival, and timing all work together, and I got a second job. By doing this, I supernaturalized my own path to freedom and self-sustainability. And since I wasn‚Äôt freaking out about money anymore, I liberated more creative real estate in my brain to apply toward my business.
The biggest challenge you will deal with in running a business is your own resistance. Before you study anything about marketing, social media, money, or time management, read this book. You‚Äôll be treated to gems like this:
Researching, studying, and reading other people‚Äôs blogs is a form of resistance. In order to get clarity, you must act. Clarity does not come by learning more ‚Äî it comes by jumping in with your instincts and putting yourself out there, even if you don‚Äôt know exactly what you‚Äôre doing.
Block out the distractions (turn off the phone, social media, and email notifications) and take inspired action that feels tangible and measurable. Set a timer for 25 minutes and go to town on a task. Do not look up. Do not go to the bathroom. Do not cruise the fridge for cheese sticks. Get something done, despite the fact that at times you will feel like you are pissing into the wind. Piss into the wind four times a day, and you‚Äôll make a difference in your bottom line.
Scrutinize any joint project carefully and qualify the person you‚Äôre collaborating with (even if they are your friend and have higher social media stats than you). Get everything in writing before you embark on the project, with a clear division of labor and deadline dates. You will most likely be splitting the profits, so have two numbers in your head: The number you need to make in order to pay for your time, and the number you would like to make. Set the first financial deadline early so that you both have the freedom to walk away if the project isn‚Äôt going to be profitable. Have a transition strategy in mind so in case that happens and one of you wants to continue on with the project, there is a way to pass the baton gracefully.
Summed up: communicate about everything ‚Äî even though you‚Äôre friends, even though you love each other, even though you trust each other, even though you‚Äôve worked together at XYZ Company, because projects have a way of going sideways and making everyone a little custodial and overreactive.
I know you just want to spend all your days making hipster sarsaparilla-scented mustache wax, or needlepointing edgy throw pillows for Etsy, or writing your YA zombie novel, or life coaching entrepreneurs to stratospheric success, but if you don‚Äôt spend time marketing you will not make money.
This was my biggest weakness when I started. I thought marketing meant slimy sales letters with big arrows and opt-in boxes, and I couldn‚Äôt! I wouldn‚Äôt! So I put my head in magical fairyland sand, stubbornly insisting that my customers would be tractor-beamed into my budding practice by the pulsating, heavenly light that radiated from my vision boards and four blog posts.
And then I ate canned food and spaghetti for a long, long time.
What rescued me? Knowing what marketing personality I embody. There are three main types:
Once you have figured out your marketing personality, selling to your customers will be a thousand times easier because you will be working within your natural vibe. Learn how you like to market and stick to that. Do it consistently and often. Even if you hire a pro, you will be doing some marketing yourself. Keeping your website fresh and current is essential, so also learn how to work WordPress and HTML code. You will be in the guts of your website a lot.
Your inbox will explode. You care about everyone, but you can‚Äôt help everyone. Read: Not everyone is your customer. Your inbox will be a jumble of people who want to say thank you, people who want free stuff, and people who want your services. Your job is to quickly discern who‚Äôs who and respond in the most appropriate way.
Shorten the email back-and-forth as quickly as possible with potential clients. If your business is a consultancy where you are selling your time, I recommend having two form letters on hand that you can customize to the occasion: one for potential customers and the other for non-potential customer.
For Your Customers: Acknowledge the situation, request, or problem and extend an invite to a 20-minute call. Include your available dates, times, and phone number.
For Non-Customers: Acknowledge the situation, request, or problem and provide other resources, practitioners, blogs, or articles that would be a splendid fit.
I love connecting personally with my clients. In this area of business, I am 1997 all the way. I pick up the phone and talk to them live. I schedule all the calls on one day or after my regular client sessions. I have found this to save a colossal amount of time. In a 20-minute phone call, I:
Do you know how long that would take back-and-forth by email? Anywhere from five days to a month. Do not screw with your own time.
Do not work your business seven days a week. Cover your legal ass from day one. From time to time, forget everything you know about the ‚Äúright way‚Äù to run a business and run it like a neighborhood lemonade stand. Do not price your offerings around your personal ability to pay for it ‚Äî you are not your ideal customer. Work out perplexing issues in your business, and it will resolve problems in other areas of your life. Connect with other entrepreneurs and set up a Skype brainstorming session (with wine). Take a walk around the block every day at lunch. And lastly, if you want to be smarter in business, follow everything these two people do: Gary Vaynerchuk and Regina Anaejionu.

Nir Eyal|439|5|https://medium.com/pminsider/abolish-the-reference-check-de55451c84d0?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|Abolish the reference check ‚Äì Product Management Insider ‚Äì Medium|"It‚Äôs time to abolish the reference check. The unpleasant process of calling up a job applicant‚Äôs former boss to gab about the candidate‚Äôs pluses and ‚Äúdeltas‚Äù is just silly. Maybe if we all just agree to stop doing it, the practice will go away, like pay phones and fanny packs. Instead, I‚Äôve learned a better way to hire that leverages a universal human attribute ‚Äî namely, the fact that we‚Äôre all lazy.
What‚Äôs my beef with reference checks? They don‚Äôt accomplish the job we intend them to do. In a startup, you can‚Äôt afford to hire B-players. But reference checks, which are intended to do the screening, fail to eliminate these candidates who are just so-so. This happens because the person giving the reference has no incentive to say anything but good things about the candidate. Telling the whole truth, warts and all, could expose the former boss to a defamation lawsuit. But legal action aside, no one likes to speak poorly about an ex-colleague. It‚Äôs bad karma and just feels icky.
Instead of asking a reference to call you and spend an awkward half-hour chitchatting about pretty much nothing, try a technique I‚Äôve come to call it the ‚Äúaverage-need-not-apply‚Äù method. Though I‚Äôm not sure who invented it, the approach was taught to me by Irv Grousbeck at Stanford.
First, send the email below to people who have worked with the candidate. This can include the references he or she provided, but it‚Äôs a good idea to find other people who‚Äôve worked with the candidate as well. I‚Äôd recommend letting the candidate know you may reach out to people they‚Äôve worked with who are not on their list of references and confirm that‚Äôs ok with them. LinkedIn makes finding former co-workers a snap, and the more people you send it to, the better it will work.
After you send this email, one of the following three things will happen:
Scenario A: It‚Äôs most likely that you will hear nothing back from the reference.
Congratulations! You saved yourself from hiring a B-player, or worse. You also saved yourself and the reference from having to conduct an uncomfortable, time-wasting phone call.
Scenario B: You receive an email back from the reference informing you that the candidate was in fact exceptional and they‚Äôd be happy to tell you more.
Congratulations! Looks like you found a star, now it‚Äôs time to have a chat to confirm the candidate is as great as you think they are and learn more about your soon-to-be employee.
Scenario C: You receive a call within 5 minutes of sending your email asking if the candidate is on the market for a new job, and if so, can you have the candidate call the reference back ASAP.
Congratulations! You‚Äôve definitely found a winner. Don‚Äôt let the candidate return the call and make an offer immediately before someone else does. This scenario has actually happened to me a few times. It‚Äôs the best predictor of the quality of candidate I‚Äôve ever seen. We immediately made offers to those candidates and without fail they turned out to be our best hires.
So why does this method work? It leverages the power of choosing a default option. Research by Eric Johnson and Daniel Goldstein demonstrated how opt-in versus opt-out decisions dramatically affect participation in organ donation programs; using a default option in the reference check allows you to affect results in a similar way.
Unlike the traditional reference check method, which elicits an overly positive response in order to preserve social harmony, the ‚Äúaverage-need-not-apply‚Äù method uses the opposite bias. By giving the reference an easy default ‚Äî in this case doing nothing ‚Äî this technique gauges just how great the reference thinks the candidate is.
Those who have a strong positive opinion of a candidate take the time to write back. By using this method, an employer can collect more data points on the potential hire with just a few emails instead of scheduling phone calls. In my experience, the results are binary. Most of the emails yield glowing replies or radio silence; both speak volumes.
By utilizing a bit of behavioral engineering instead of performing the reference check, employers can make better hiring decisions and make the hiring process better for everyone involved ‚Äî except maybe the B-players.

I‚Äôve been in business for seven years. To get here, I engaged in my own personal and tenuous renaissance (uh... divorce) and rediscovered my Core Purpose. In other words, I grew a pair of ladyballs, launched a business, and figured out how to turn my efforts into profit.
But there was a lot to learn, some of which wasn‚Äôt covered in Who Moved My Cheese?
Throw these four rockstars into a blender, and you‚Äôll have a composite sketch of me in the first three months of my business:
Glitter was literally shooting out of my eye sockets as I quit my PR firm job. Full of optimism, living in New York City, and surrounded by a tribe of friends who were also launching businesses, I felt it was the perfect time to make a bold move to entrepreneurship. I was now officially Living My Dream and Working For Myself, which meant I was in charge of my financial destiny and Captain of My Promising Future.
Luckily, my initial hyperoptimism buoyed me whilst, oscillating between euphoria and despair, I was slowly but systematically forced off The Magic School Bus and onto the S.S. Battleship Long Haul.
I was a quick and eager learner, but despite the hours of webinar watching, countless Friday nights pumping out site copy, and teaching myself everything I could about HTML, there were just some things I didn‚Äôt get. I had to fall on my ass to procure the ‚Äúmaster‚Äôs degree in life survival‚Äù every entrepreneur earns on their ‚Äújourney.‚Äù (Yes, those are bitterly gesticulated air quotes.)
Here are 11 things I wish I knew when I started my business. I hope they will save you some time, and at the very least, some anguish because ‚Äî experience is a good teacher here ‚Äî the sodium from your tears acts as a corrosive melting agent on all brands of premium ice cream (though it does make a superb saline for your dirty martini). Cry over a cup, oh fathomless bird of preneurial gumption!
Your success (and financial stability) will come from expertly running your business ‚Äî not writing copy, rebranding your client‚Äôs website, teaching yoga, podcasting, or making jewelry. In other words, you will spend 15 percent of your time doing what you love (your gift, in my case coaching and writing) and 85 percent marketing, administrating, selling, strategizing, and answering a shitload of email.

Tucker Max|369|9|https://medium.com/startup-grind/my-startup-made-200k-in-its-first-two-months-and-im-embarrassed-51173a0ffcf9?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|My Startup Made 200k In It‚Äôs First Two Months... And I‚Äôm Embarrassed|"It all started with a simple question from a frustrated entrepreneur:
She asked me these questions because I am uniquely qualified to answer them. First, I‚Äôm a writer: I‚Äôve written three #1 NY Times Best Sellers. But beyond that, I‚Äôm an entrepreneur: I started and exited a publishing company that established the current model for many very successful authors, like Hugh Howey‚Äôs deal with Simon & Schuster.
Because of these two facets, I get some version of this question on a nearly daily basis, and I have a canned answer to quickly get out of these conversations.
I tell people that sitting down to write is not an optional part of the book creation process‚Äîin fact, it‚Äôs the very point of the process‚Äîand that they can‚Äôt have something (a book) without doing the work necessary to create it (write it).
I usually say it in a disdainful tone, sneering at the laziness of people who presume that books are something they can just ‚Äúget‚Äù without having to do the hard work. I often throw in some version of the ‚Äúeveryone wants to be a star, but no one wants to do the work‚Äù quote that Mark Cuban made famous.
Melissa Gonzalez, the entrepreneur who asked me the question, was different. And this was not just some dinner. This was an LDV Entrepreneur Dinner (LDV is an invite-only organization run by Evan Nisselson, that brings together successful entrepreneurs with the stated intent of helping each other).
Nonetheless, fully bathing in my writer‚Äôs arrogance, I gave her my usual canned speech about ‚Äúhard work‚Äù and ‚Äúthe difficult process being part of the work.‚Äù When she rolled her eyes at me, I wondered what I had said that was so bad.
She stopped me and reframed her question:
This was a straight up call out... and she was exactly right.
I was not talking to some schmoe. This woman knew those lessons‚Äîshe‚Äôd built her own successful business, in the extremely competitive field of retail.
Here I was at dinner with 30+ entrepreneurs who are all more successful than me, and I was lecturing one of them about hard work, instead of thinking of a way to solve her problem.
I have seen the embarrassed amateur in the room, and he is me.
I was too flustered to brainstorm a solution in the moment, so I told her that I would think about it, and get in touch.
Because I got called out‚Äîand I was so clearly, embarrassingly wrong‚ÄîI ended up obsessing over her problem for weeks. Which of course got me nowhere. Finding ways to make the publishing process easy is doable, but all I kept coming back to was the fact that there was no way to write a book without putting in the time to write it. The writing is part of the process, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called WRITING a book.
I eventually gave up on finding a solution, and a few days later‚Äîafter I‚Äôd stopped thinking about it, of course‚Äîthe solution hit me, like a lightning strike:
I started unpacking all of this in my head with a little one-man Socratic method:
A. A book is just a collection of thoughts that are expressed in words, and assembled in the form of a finite, defined text.
A. Books‚Äîespecially non-fiction books‚Äîexist to take a singular, contained idea out of the head of the author, and put it into the head of readers.
A. Writing thoughts down in words and sentences is the process by which the ideas are put into books.
A. If books exist to transfer ideas from one head to another, AND writing is the way by which people commit their ideas to words to put into books‚Äîis there another way to get those thoughts into a book, without writing? How would that happen? Of course there is‚Äîtalking!!
A. If I can find a way for her to talk about her ideas, instead of write her ideas down, could I then give her a finished book? Can Melissa just talk about her ideas instead of writing them down? Of course she can!
The problem was that I didn‚Äôt really have a precise process to do this and, quite honestly, I wasn‚Äôt sure this was going to work.
But like Melissa said, this is what entrepreneurship is about: solving problems that give people what they want.
So I connected Melissa with a former employee of mine, Zach Obront, and the three of us decided to collaborate on this project, to test it and see what would happen.
Start to finish, the whole process took about 5 months. As we were working through this process, I told a few people I know about this idea, and all of them loved the idea, said I should do this as a company, and they wanted the same service.
Yeah, yeah ‚Äî everyone loves every start-up idea until it comes time to pay right?
Except two of them bought packages. Like...with real money...during the call.
A few weeks later, I went on a podcast to talk about a whole different subject. During that podcast, I talked about this idea for 20 minutes, sort of by accident. Off of that single episode, we sold four more packages, which meant six packages sold before we even confirmed to ourselves that we would offer this as a service to customers.
When you are selling a product before you even formally offer it to customers, you‚Äôre onto something. That is pretty much the definition of product-market fit.
Zach and I decided to call the company ‚ÄúBook In A Box‚Äù (now called Scribe Media) and officially started offering the services to customers in August 2014. In the next two months , we did more than $200k in revenue. I had a different publishing services company, and some other side projects I was working on, and I have shelved all of that. Now we focus on Scribe full time.
What‚Äôs really cool, at least to me, is how excited I am about this company. Not just because it‚Äôs making money. Yes, money is great, but in this case the money is only the proof of what matters in a new start-up idea: that you are creating real value for real people, by solving their real problems. It appears that Scribe does just that‚Äîa lot of people really want a book, but they don‚Äôt have the time, ability, or patience to do it the conventional way. We solve their problem.
Not only do we solve their problem, we do it in way that is easier and cheaper than anything else they can do. Take ghostwriting for example. To hire a ghostwriter, you‚Äôre going to pay at least $40k (and usually much more for a good one). You have no guarantees of quality or process with them, and they don‚Äôt do anything but help you write the book manuscript‚Äîno publishing, no marketing, nothing. You have to pay for that separately, from a different company. Our packages range from $15k to $25k‚Äîand we do everything necessary to create a professionally published book, with no work from the author aside from talking.
But as great as this is, you know what my overwhelming emotion is right now, even more than being excited?
I feel embarrassed.
I feel embarrassed because people have been asking the question ‚ÄúHow do I get a book‚Äù for almost a decade, and my answer that whole time has been some version of elitist sneering at their lack of work ethic. I wasn‚Äôt thinking like an entrepreneur, I was thinking like the type of person I always claim to hate‚Äîthe one who says the status quo is the only way, that you have to do it ‚Äúthe way it‚Äôs always been done.‚Äù
It‚Äôs really embarrassing, at least to me, that it took me this long to see what has been right in front of my face for years. The technology existed to do this from the first day I was asked that question, almost a decade ago, and I was too arrogant and fixed in my notions of what a ‚Äúwriter‚Äù had to be in order to see it.
But I guess that‚Äôs the benefit of being around the type of women and men you meet at the LDV dinners (or any good entrepreneurial event with good people)‚Äîsmart people help you see your own biases and weaknesses, so you can fix them.
And if you fix your own problem, chances are lots of other people have that same problem, and if you can fix their problem the same way you fixed yours, you provide real value to the world...and that is the best place to start a business.

Andy Raskin|55K|8|https://medium.com/the-mission/the-greatest-sales-deck-ive-ever-seen-4f4ef3391ba0?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|The Greatest Sales Deck I‚Äôve Ever Seen ‚Äì The Mission ‚Äì Medium|"A few months ago, my friend Tim took a new sales job at a Series C tech company that had raised over $60 million from A-list investors. He‚Äôs one of the best salespeople I know, but soon after starting, he emailed me to say he was struggling.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve landed a few small accounts,‚Äù Tim said. ‚ÄúBut my pitch falls flat at big enterprises.‚Äù
As I‚Äôve written before, I love helping teams craft the high-level strategic story that powers sales, marketing, fundraising ‚Äî everything. So Tim and I met for lunch at the Amber India restaurant off San Francisco‚Äôs Market Street to review his deck.
After loading up on the all-you-can-eat buffet, I asked Tim, ‚ÄúAt what point do prospects tune out?‚Äù
‚ÄúUsually a few slides in,‚Äù he said.
Intent on maximizing dining ROI, Tim went back to the buffet for seconds. When he returned, I pulled out my laptop and launched into a Powerpoint presentation.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù Tim asked.
‚ÄúThis,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúis the greatest sales deck I have ever seen.‚Äù
The sales deck I showed Tim came from Zuora, the IPO-bound Silicon Valley company that sells a SaaS platform for subscription billing. If you pay for anything on a recurring basis (e.g. enterprise software), there‚Äôs a good chance that Zuora facilitates those transactions.
I had received the deck from an ex-Zuora salesperson, who said it helped him close the biggest deals of his career. (I have no connection to Zuora, and no relationship with anyone who currently works there. UPDATE: Some current Zuora employees have connected with me after reading this.)
Abandoning his naan in a puddle of curried goat, Tim grabbed pen and paper and took notes as we ran through what made the Zuora deck so effective.
Specifically, we noted how brilliantly the deck led prospects through the following five elements, in precisely this order:
(The ex-Zuora salesperson asked that I not share the Zuora deck publicly, and I will honor that request. However, I found slides on Zuora‚Äôs website and SlideShare channel that exhibit nearly the same narrative flow; all of the images below come from those public sources.)
Don‚Äôt kick off a sales presentation by talking about your product, your headquarters locations, your investors, your clients, or anything about yourself.
Instead, name the undeniable shift in the world that creates both (a) big stakes and (b) huge urgency for your prospect.
The first slide of virtually every Zuora deck ‚Äî sales or otherwise ‚Äî is some version of this:
Zuora came up with the phrase ‚Äúsubscription economy‚Äù to name the trend in which buyers increasingly choose recurring service payments over outright purchases. Zuora usually follows that with a slide laying out the history of the change:
Note the subtle but important difference from what most pitch advice tells you, which is to start with ‚Äúthe problem.‚Äù When you assert that your prospects have a problem, you put them on the defensive. They may be unaware of the problem, or uncomfortable admitting they suffer from it.
But when you highlight a shift in the world, you get prospects to open up about how that shift affects them, how it scares them, and where they see opportunities. Most importantly, you grab their attention. As Hollywood screenwriting guru Robert McKee says:
All prospects suffer from what economists call ‚Äúloss aversion.‚Äù That is, they tend to avoid a possible loss by sticking to the status quo, rather than risk a possible gain by opting for change.
To combat loss aversion, you must demonstrate how the change you cited above will create big winners and big losers. In other words, you have to show both of the following:
Zuora neatly accomplishes this by documenting a ‚Äúmass extinction‚Äù among Fortune 500 companies...
...and then showing how the ‚Äúwinners‚Äù have shifted from product ownership to subscription services. Those include upstarts...
...as well as rejuvenated incumbents:
To bring the point home, Zuora asks the following:
Of course, by this point the common thread is already well established in prospects‚Äô minds: Winners adopt the subscription service models that Zuora supports.
It‚Äôs tempting at this point to jump into the details of your product or service. Resist that urge.
If you introduce product/service details too soon, prospects won‚Äôt yet have enough context for why those details are important, and they‚Äôll tune out.
Instead, first present a ‚Äúteaser‚Äù vision of the happily-ever-after that your product/service will help the prospect achieve‚Äîwhat I call the Promised Land.
Your Promised Land should be both desirable (obviously) and difficult for the prospect to achieve without outside help. Otherwise, why does your company exist?
After demonstrating that the subscription economy will result in winners and losers, Zuora presents this Promised Land slide, which offers concrete criteria for what it means to win in the subscription economy:
Note that the Promised Land is a new future state, not your product or service.
(Over lunch, I asked my friend Tim to articulate his Promised Land, and he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have the most innovative platform for ____.‚Äù Nope: the Promised Land is not having your technology, but what life is like thanks to having your technology.)
Your Promised Land is also crucial for helping prospects pitch your solution to colleagues after your sales meeting ends. In your absence, those colleagues will ask, ‚ÄúWhat do those guys do again?‚Äù Armed with a compelling Promised Land, your prospects are more likely to supply an answer that gets others on board.
If it‚Äôs not clear by now, successful sales decks follow the same narrative structure as epic films and fairy tales. Your prospect is Luke, and you‚Äôre Obi Wan, furnishing a lightsaber to help him defeat the Empire. Your prospect is Frodo, and you‚Äôre Gandalf, wielding wizardry to help him destroy the ring. Your prospect is Cinderella, and you‚Äôre the fairy godmother, casting spells to get her to the ball.
When you introduce your product or service, do so by positioning its capabilities like the lightsaber, wizardry and spells‚Äîas ‚Äúmagic gifts‚Äù for helping your main character (prospect) reach that much-desired Promised Land.
For example, above is the slide where Zuora talks about the structure of its customer record. Out of context, this detail would likely bore even the most technical prospect.
Positioned in the context of transitioning from an ‚Äúold world‚Äù to a ‚Äúnew world,‚Äù however, it‚Äôs the foundation for an engaging conversation with prospects‚Äîtechnical and otherwise‚Äîabout why it‚Äôs so hard to reach the Promised Land with traditional solutions.
In telling the sales narrative this way, you‚Äôre making a commitment to prospects: If they go with you, you‚Äôll get them to the Promised Land.
But the road to the Promised Land is, by definition, littered with obstacles, so prospects are rightly skeptical of your ability to deliver. The last piece of the pitch, then, is the best evidence you can offer that you can make the story you‚Äôre telling come true.
By far, the most effective type of evidence is a success story about how you‚Äôve already helped someone else (who is similar to the prospect) reach the Promised Land. Zuora has a set of customer success stories that sales reps draw on, and while they‚Äôre more elaborate in the actual deck, this testimonial captures the essence:
I also like this one, from an exec at NCR (a Zuora customer), which speaks more explicitly to Zuora‚Äôs stated Promised Land:
What if you don‚Äôt yet have a huge number of successful customers? Product demos are the next most effective evidence, but again, features should always be presented in the context of how they help a prospect reach the Promised Land.
Of course, successful sales rarely happen solely as the result of a great deck. In order for salespeople to be successful, the entire organization must align around the narrative about change, Promised Land, and Magic Gifts.
There‚Äôs no better example of that than Zuora. If you ever see a Zuora executive speak‚Äîincluding CEO Tien Tzuo‚Äîyou‚Äôll almost certainly hear about the subscription economy and the winners and losers it‚Äôs creating. In fact, that‚Äôs the theme of virtually all the company‚Äôs marketing communications and campaigns, as well as its public vision statement:
According to the ex-Zuora salesperson, this company-wide alignment around the story made him wildly successful:
Just three weeks after our lunch, Tim called to say he was seeing promising changes in how prospects at large enterprises were reacting to his new deck, which we drafted together based on Zuora‚Äôs template. For one thing, prospects opened up much faster about the challenges they were facing. Also, he said the new pitch was more effective at engaging CFOs and other senior gatekeepers.
Then, a week after that, Tim emailed with even better news: He had just signed the largest deal in his company‚Äôs history.
Next week, we‚Äôre headed back to Amber India to celebrate.

SteÃÅphane Nasser|2K|9|https://medium.com/parisoma-blog/valuation-for-startups-9-methods-explained-53771c86590e?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|Valuation For Startups ‚Äî 9 Methods Explained ‚Äì The PARISOMA Review ‚Äì Medium|"This article was co-written and published in French by Augustin de Cambourg, in Portuguese by Raphael Mielle, and in Spanish by Alberto Martinez de Arenaza.
A startup is like a box. A very special box.
The box has a value. The more things you put in the box, the more its value increases. Add a patent in the box, the value increases. Add a kick-ass management team in the box, the value increases. Easy, right?
The box is also magic. When you put $1 inside, it will return you $2, $3 or even $10! Amazing!
Problem is, building a box can be very expensive. So you need to go and see people with money ‚Äî let‚Äôs call them investors ‚Äî and offer them a deal that sounds a bit like this:
But how much should ‚ÄúX‚Äù be?
It depends on the Pre-Money Valuation, e.g. the value of the box at the moment of the investment. But calculating the Pre-Money Valuation is tricky. This article will take you through 9 different valuation methods to better let you understand how to determine Pre-Money Valuation.
The Berkus Method is a simple and convenient rule of thumb to estimate the value of your box. It was designed by Dave Berkus, a renowned author and business angel investor. The starting point is: do you believe that the box can reach $20M in revenue by the fifth year of business? If the answer is yes, then you can assess your box against the 5 key criteria for building boxes.
This will give you a rough idea of how much your box is worth (AKA pre-money valuation) and more importantly, what you should improve. Note that according to Berkus, the pre-money valuation should not be more than $2M.
The Berkus Method is meant for pre-revenue startups. To read more about the Berkus Method, click here.
The Risk Factor Summation Method or RFS Method is a slightly more evolved version of the Berkus Method. First, you determine an initial value for your box. Then you adjust said value for 12 risk factors inherent to box-building.
Initial value is determined as the average value for a similar box in your area, and risk factors are modelled as multiples of $250k, ranging from $500k for a very low risk, to -$500k for a very high risk. The most difficult part here, and in most valuation methods, is actualy finding data about similar boxes.
The Risk Factor Summation Method is meant for pre-revenue startups. To read more about the Risk Factor Summation Method, click here.
The Scorecard Valuation Method is a more elaborate approach to the box valuation problem. It starts the same way as the RFS method i.e. you determine a base valuation for your box, then you adjust the value for a certain set of criteria. Nothing new, except that those criteria are themselves weighed up based on their impact on the overall success of the project.
This method can also be found under the name of Bill Payne Method, considering 6 criteria: Management (30%), Size of opportunity (25%), Product or Service (10%), Sales channels (10%), Stage of business (10%) and Other factors (15%).
The Scorecard Valuation Method is meant for pre-revenue startups. To read more about the Scorecard Valuation Method, click here.
The Comparable Transactions Method is really just a rule of three.
Depending on the type of box you are building, you want to find an indicator which will be a good proxy for the value of your box. This indicator can be specific to your industry: Monthly Recurring Revenue (Saas), HR headcount (Interim), Number of outlets (Retail), Patent filed (Medtech/Biotech), Weekly Active Users or WAU (Messengers). Most of the time, you can just take lines from the P&L : sales, gross margin, EBITDA, etc.
The Comparables Transactions Method is meant for pre- and post-revenue startups. To read more about the Comparable Transactions Method, click here.
Forget about how magical the box is, and see how much 1 pound of cardboard is worth.
The book value refers to the net worth of the company i.e. the tangible assets of the box i.e. the ‚Äúhard parts‚Äù of the box.
The Book Value Method is particularly irrelevant for startups as it is focused on the ‚Äútangible‚Äù value of the company, while most startups focus on intangible assets : RD (for a biotech), user base and software development (for a Web startup), etc. To read more about the Book Value method, click here.
Rarely good from a seller perspective, the liquidation value is, as implied by its name, the valuation you apply to a company when it is going out of business.
Things that counts for a liquidation value estimation are all the tangible assets: Real Estate, Equipment, Inventory... Everything you can find a buyer for in a short span of time. The mindset is: if I sell whatever the company can in less than two months, how much money does that make ? All the intangibles on the other hand are considered worthless in a liquidation process (the underlying assumption is that if it was worth something, it would have already been sold at the time you enter in liquidation): patents, copyright, and any other intellectual property.
Practically, the liquidation value is the sum of the scrap value of all the tangible assets of the company.
For an investor, the liquidation value is useful as a parameter to evaluate the risk of the investment: a higher potential liquidation value means a lower risk. For example, all other things equal, it is preferable to invest in a company that owns its equipment compared to one that leases it. If everything goes wrong and you go out of business, at least you can get some money selling the equipment, whereas nothing if you lease it.
So, what is the difference between book value and liquidation value ? If a startup really had to sell its assets in the case of a bankruptcy, the value it would get from the sale would likely be below its book value, due to the adverse conditions of the sales.
So liquidation value < book value. Although they both account for tangible assets, the context in which those assets are valued differs. As Ben Graham points out, the liquidation value measures what the stockholders could get out of the business, while the book value measures what they have put into the business.
If your box works well, it brings in a certain amount of cash every year. Consequently, you could say that the current value of the box is the sum of all the future cash flows over the next years. And that is exactly the reasoning behind the DCF method.
Let‚Äôs say you are projecting cash flows over n years. What happens after that ? This is the question addressed by the Terminal Value (TV)
Option 1: you consider the business will keep growing at a steady pace, and keep generating indefinite cash flows after the n years period. You can then apply the formula for Terminal Value : : TV = CFn+1/(r- g) with ‚Äúr‚Äù being the discount rate and ‚Äúg‚Äù being the expected growth rate.
Option 2 : you consider an exit after the n year period. First, you want to estimate the future value of the acquisition, for example with the comparable method transaction (see above). Then, you have to discount this future value to get its net present value. TV = exit value/(1+r)^n
Although technically, you could use it for post-revenue startups, it is just not meant for startup valuation. To read more about the DCF method, click here.
The First Chicago Method answers to a specific situation: what if your box has a small chance of becoming huge? How to assess this potential?
The First Chicago Method (named after the late First Chicago Bank ‚Äî if you ask) deals with this issue by making three valuations: a worst case scenario (tiny box), a normal case scenario (normal box), a best case scenario (big box).
Each valuation is made with the DCF Method (or, if not possible, with internal rate of return formula or with multiples). You then decide of a percentage reflecting the probability of each scenario to happen. Your valuation according to the First Chicago Method is the weigthed average of each case.
The First Chicago Method is meant for post-revenue startups. You can read more about the First Chicago Method here.
As its name indicate, the Venture Capital Method stands from the viewpoint of the investor.
An investor is always looking for a specific return on investment, let‚Äôs say 20x. Besides, according to industry standards, the investor thinks that your box could be sold for $100M in 8 years. Based on those two elements, the investor can easily determine the maximum price he or she is willing to pay for investing in your box, after adjusting for dilution.
The Venture Capital Method is meant for pre- and post-revenue startups. To read more about the Venture Capital Method, click here.
Congratulations! If you made it this far, you know 9 valuation methods. So you must be screaming from the inside: what is the best valuation method ?!
First, keep in mind that the only methods really used by VCs are comparables and a rough estimate of how much dilution is acceptable by the founders ‚Äî e.g. giving out 15% to 25% for a seed round comprised between ‚Ç¨300k and ‚Ç¨500k, or making sure that the founders remain majority shareholders after a Series A.
Second, let us remember that valuations are nothing but formalized guesstimates. Valuations never show the true value of your company. They just show two things: (1) how bad the market is willing to invest in your little red box, and (2) how bad you are willing to accept it.
Having said that, I find that the best valuation method is the one described by Pierre Entremont, early-stage investor at Otium Capital, in this excellent article. According to him, you should start from defining your needs and then negotiate dilution:
Valuations are a good starting point when considering fundraising. They help builing up the reasoning behind the figures and objectify the discussion. But in the end, they are just the theoretical introduction to a more significant game of supply and demand.

But if you use the right tools, your life can be a lot easier and better.
My general opinion about apps, tools, and resources is this: It doesn‚Äôt matter.
I say that because most people hide behind their apps. We‚Äôre always looking for the ONE app that will turn us into a productivity monster.
Or we believe that tools or other resources will help us do better work.
YouTuber and filmmaker Casey Neistat makes this point very clear, he says:
When it comes to writing, Stephen King has a similar approach. Whenever he‚Äôs asked about tools, he doesn‚Äôt even answer. If you want to become a better writer, he says:
I‚Äôm sure you know there‚Äôs only one way to get things done: Put your head down and work fucking hard. But often, we still think these type of thoughts:
These are all reasons we procrastinate. Now, of course, tools matter. But they are not the determining factor. You are.
It‚Äôs not about the resources you have; it‚Äôs about what you do with them. Life is about resourcefulness. And that‚Äôs the point people like Casey Neistat and Stephen King want to make.
What you‚Äôll find next is a list of 7 of my favorite apps and how I use them. When you use the tools in the right way, you can easily save 10 hours per week.
If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre probably a knowledge worker. And a knowledge worker‚Äôs primary weapon is her words.
I strongly believe that if you want to become a better communicator, it all starts on paper. Learn how to think and write well, and you will ultimately become better at speaking, sales, copywriting, programming, doing interviews, leading, etc.
The very words you use are EVERYTHING in how you conduct yourself. Especially in an increasingly digital world where people shy away from face-to-face contact.
And Grammarly is the best tool to help you with communicating. Most people think a grammar checker is only for writers.
But I mainly use Grammarly‚Äôs browser extension for daily use. I use it for writing emails in Gmail, responding to comments, or any other site I have to write something.
I also edit my articles with Grammarly (they also have an MS Office add-on). It checks for passive voice, grammatical, spelling, and punctuation mistakes.
All in all, this app saves me about 30 minutes a day in sheer brainpower. With Grammarly, I can just focus on writing and communicating my message; they do the rest.
Reading improves focus, productivity, creativity, and it reduces stress. The benefits are so great that it makes you think everybody should be reading books like crazy.
Nope.
23% of Americans have not read a single book in the past year. And the number of books people read per year are also not pretty. Only 28% reads more than 11 books per year.
And I get it. Reading takes time. Plus, one of my main challenges is to select which books I‚Äôm going to read.
In the past, I‚Äôve often bought books, and quit them half-way through because they were not useful or interesting. That costs me time and money. That‚Äôs frustrating, especially because you can only read so many books every year.
If you‚Äôre like me, your reading list grows faster than you cross off books, and that‚Äôs a problem. Why? You want to read the RIGHT books. You want to read books that make you grow; personally, professionally, financially.
And I‚Äôve finally found a solution to the question of: ‚ÄúWhat book should I read next?‚Äù
Blinkist creates quality summaries of non-fiction books. Every day I read one book summary, and if I want to learn more, I get the actual book. If not, I just eliminate the book from my reading list.
You have to be realistic; you just can‚Äôt read all the books in the world. And it‚Äôs important to figure out how you decide which books you‚Äôre going to read.
Also, I don‚Äôt rely on reviews to select books because a book that‚Äôs useless to you can be valuable to me.
You should eliminate those two thoughts from your head. Why? Because they plant the seeds of something that‚Äôs called: WASTING TIME.
I use Trello as a backlog of tasks that I have to do. If you don‚Äôt know Trello; it‚Äôs a versatile project management tool that can be used in many ways.
With Trello you can create ‚Äòboards‚Äô for every project you have. And on every board, you can list all the actions you have to complete for that project.
Every week I take some time to update my projects. That helps me to improve my focus, so I know what I have to do.
Whenever I don‚Äôt know what to do, I open Trello: There‚Äôs ALWAYS something to do.
Browsing blogs remains one of the main sources of wasting time for most of us.
I have a simple tip for you: Stop clicking on articles you see in your social feeds.
Most people open Facebook, Twitter, or even news sites, and they click on anything thing that looks slightly interesting.
DON‚ÄôT.
Instead, make a list of 5‚Äì10 blogs/authors you love to read. Then, add them to Feedly or follow the bloggers/publications on Medium. Every day, only read your articles through Feedly and Medium.
This saves at least 1 hour of mindless browsing per week.
I still meet a lot of entrepreneurs and freelancers who don‚Äôt work in the cloud. If you‚Äôre one of them, you‚Äôre wasting a lot of time.
Just the few minutes it takes to open files from folders, save them on external drives, or share your documents with others, adds up quickly.
A few minutes here and there become a few hours a week, and hundreds of hours per year.
I use Office 365 because I like to work offline too (plus, I‚Äôm a little old school ‚Äî I‚Äôm used to Office). But Google Docs also works well.
Let‚Äôs keep this short: If you‚Äôre not working in the cloud, it‚Äôs time to move there.
I save about 1 hour per week by having easy access to all my documents (on all my devices) in the cloud. I only focus on working and sharing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
I don‚Äôt want to think about anything else that‚Äôs involved with productivity. And that‚Äôs what these apps are great at.
Forget about to-do lists, fancy productivity apps, or anything else that promises you to get shit done.
There‚Äôs only one thing that helps you to get things done: Your calendar.
It‚Äôs so obvious that most of us ignore it. We prefer fancy looking to-do lists with all colors of the rainbow, and that make sounds when you check off an item.
The research is clear: To-do lists don‚Äôt work. And yet, most people stick to them.
Ditch the to-do list and use your calendar as your number one productivity tool. Take some time to plan your week. Ask: When will I do what? Then, schedule it in your calendar. I do this exercise every day.
I promise that it will save you at least 15 minutes a day of updating your to-do list.
I love working with the Pomodoro method. Research shows that it improves focus and the quality of your output.
Whenever I don‚Äôt use an app like Tomighty, I just waste hours every day. This app can easily save you one hour per DAY.
How? When you work in intervals, you get more done in less time because of the improved focus.
As you might have noticed, productivity is all about eliminating time-wasting activities, and improving your focus.
In that way you get the RIGHT things done, and you ultimately save a lot of hours every week.
Start living more consciously of your time and productivity: Save your time for other, more important, things.
If you do that, you can use those precious hours with your family, friends, spouse. Or you can spend the time to improve your skills.
Because at the end of the ride, when you‚Äôre on your deathbed, you won‚Äôt think about all apps, tools, or resources you used. No, you‚Äôll reflect on all the great things you did with them.
So what are you waiting for? You have the tools you need to be successful. Only thing left is this: Go out and DO things with the resources you have.

Westenberg üåà|616|5|https://medium.com/hi-my-name-is-jon/yo-instagram-folks-holding-packets-of-tea-is-not-a-business-model-7c9d9c6eda5a?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|Yo, Instagram folks. Holding packets of tea is not a business model.|"I‚Äôm on Instagram. And I enjoy it a lot, but if there‚Äôs one part that makes me want to rage quit, it‚Äôs the endless photos of fitness influencers, models and beautiful people holding up packets of skinny tea.
You know, the tea that helps people lose weight by basically being a fucking laxative.
It‚Äôs not that they necessarily believe in the product, if they did it might not piss me off as much as it does. It‚Äôs that holding pictures of skinny tea is their entire business, and they‚Äôd call themselves entrepreneurs for doing it.
Here‚Äôs the problem ‚Äî these people are thinking that influence on its own is a business model and they‚Äôre running to whoever can monetize that influence, without considering their careers or long term entrepreneurship
Why does this matter? It matters for the same reason the old Myspace stars‚Äô failure mattered ‚Äî they‚Äôre not building any kid of asset, they‚Äôre not building a repeatable business model, and by their nature, they have to expand into something more tangible or die.
When Myspace stumbled, those people‚Äôs livelihoods and celebrity status was wiped out. Now the only reason anyone‚Äôs been talking about Tila Tequila is because she supports Trump and thinks the Earth is flat.
The thing is, the Instagram success is not worth nearly as much as the people enjoying it think. It‚Äôs just not. In fact, as an asset it‚Äôs almost totally worthless, when you compare its monetary value with the hours spent building it, and how easy it would be for it all to disappear.
Here‚Äôs an awesome read, about just how meaningless it all is:
That‚Äôs about as clear as anyone‚Äôs going to put it.
There‚Äôs just very little value here. You can call it advertising, but it‚Äôs not even that, it‚Äôs more brand awareness creation, based on content that has very little value on its own and exists as a throw away medium.
And they do live and die by those platforms. The businesses that rely on them to drive commerce will too.
The influencers are talking about building a business. What they‚Äôre really building ‚Äî all they‚Äôre building ‚Äî is a network. And it‚Äôs not the same thing.
Networks are social, and they‚Äôre worth only the sum of their parts. They can fracture and fall to pieces, and they can become totally worthless. Networks losing their value is the oldest media failure in the history of technology.
You can tell me that it doesn‚Äôt matter, but the Instagram influencers aren‚Äôt seeing this as a fun side gig. For a lot of them, it‚Äôs their career. And their career could drop them pretty damn fast.
If you‚Äôre building influence, the trick is to turn it into a business. If you‚Äôre an Instagram star, and you‚Äôre turning a buck holding packets of tea in your finest Athleisure, the clock is ticking and the onus is going to be on you to do something more.
To turn your network into a customer base, and to turn your business model into something repeatable and long term. There are people who are starting to do this pretty fucking effectively. Pia Muehlenbeck for example, with her clothing line. She‚Äôs an Instagram influencer who has been working hard to turn that audience into a business, and I really admire her.
There are businesses that can be built around having a large audience, but having a large audience is just not a business model on its own. If you treat it like one, it‚Äôs not going to go your way. Not forever.
I want to be clear. You can create whatever content you want. These influencers on Instagram, I‚Äôm not dragging their photos or their creative work in any way.
They make content they love, that their followers love. But unless they have a real business model, they aren‚Äôt building something that‚Äôs of lasting value ‚Äî and that‚Äôs only going to bite ‚Äôem later on.

I initially set out with a 30 day goal of breaking 120,000 views and 50,000 complete reads. I felt that was a pretty lofty goal, but I was confident that I could make it happen.
30 days later, I‚Äôm past 500,000 views and over 200,000 reads and I‚Äôm incredibly happy with how the last month as gone.
I‚Äôm proud and humbled by the impact my posts have been getting, and I want to thank every single one of my readers.
I also want to talk about how I‚Äôve hit this milestone. I know for a lot of writers, getting to the point where you have a regular audience is tough. In fact, it‚Äôs fucking depressing. You can slog away consistently, and never feel like you‚Äôre making progress.
So this is how I hit the 500,000 view milestone in 30 days. I hope it‚Äôs useful.
Note ‚Äî I‚Äôm not affiliated with the following apps in any way, I‚Äôm just a massive fan & would probably be lost without ‚Äôem.
I‚Äôve recently been invited by The Todoist Team to try their app, and I‚Äôm excited to give it a shot.
You won‚Äôt hit the goals you don‚Äôt prepare for. If you‚Äôre working on any project, the most important phase is always the pre-game. If you start out on the wrong foot, in the wrong way, with no plan, you are not going to succeed.
My preparation was largely around designing processes. I‚Äôve spoken before about the way I schedule writing into my life and ensure that I‚Äôve got a system in place. I went through a process of refining that system to support publishing 5‚Äì6 times a week.
I knew that was going to be a crazy schedule, and without a plan in place it wouldn‚Äôt work out. I also knew that breaking my previous month‚Äôs record of 116,000 views was going to be hard, and that a high output of great writing was the only way to do it.
The system is explained pretty well here:
Beyond that, I settled on some templates early on, working out a frame for each post that would allow me to include a solid intro, a series of points, and an outro. The templates included where I would insert the images as well.
The topics I worked on in the past month were ones I knew my readers wanted to see. I researched my previous work thoroughly, read the feedback and examined what posts struck a cord ‚Äî and why.
With that research in hand, I‚Äôve been talking one-on-one with my readers to learn more about their interests, what they enjoy about my writing, and what they‚Äôre looking for more of.
Knowing that they wanted to learn, they wanted posts that cut through the bullshit and offered practicalities and they wanted posts that kept to around the 5‚Äì8 minute mark was useful. I then had to ask if I could write posts that would meet that criteria without selling myself and my own interests out.
The short answer? I could. As long as the topics were personal, real, and directly represented what I believe, I knew I‚Äôd be okay trying to offer my audience what they wanted and needed.
I started the month with a list of 30 posts, scheduled well in advance.
Publishing the number of posts I reached in the past month was about making the writing a number one priority. It was the first thing I did when I woke up, and the last thing I did before I hit the sack. That‚Äôs a tough regimen to maintain, but it did ensure consistency.
Quality control was a pretty big priority too. You can‚Äôt have a well received story if you‚Äôre publishing total crap, and readers are always smart enough to know when you‚Äôre phoning it in.
I‚Äôm pretty harsh on myself. If I feel a piece is not up to my standard, I will not release it. I will delete the entire thing and start again. That‚Äôs happened about 5‚Äì10 times in the past month. It hurts, but you have to set and keep standards.
I can‚Äôt hire people to write these posts for me. Largely because the whole point of my writing is that I love doing it. I genuinely love writing. What I can do is ask people to make the processes behind it a little easier.
I have some incredible people who are happy to help me out, and their roles are quite simple. They find the right images to accompany each piece, format my writing where it needs a tweak, and call me out when my work sucks.
They take the work that is normally written in markdown and make sure it looks good on the page.
Giving me back that time is invaluable, and it makes it a lot easier to stay productive. It also keeps me going on the writing side, without having to become caught in the technical aspects.
You can also read this. It‚Äôs about sexism. And how it‚Äôs total bullshit.

It‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of wanting one team member to take on the responsibilities of multiple roles. With design, it‚Äôs unfortunate yet common enough for teams to have their engineering talent handle the task. But there is an opportunity cost of having developers partition their workflow to do design and development, giving them less time to do the work they excel at. Plus, design will likely take them more time than someone who is familiar with design tools.
Furthermore, design is not like code, in that you don‚Äôt have to be technical to see it‚Äôs results, making everyone a critic. However, it‚Äôs one thing to critique design it‚Äôs another to create it. So when your developer wants to do UX/UI design on your product, do like Nancy Reagan, and ‚ÄúJust Say No‚Äù. Your developers should be focused on the things they excel at.
Audiences today require fluid UX and premium interaction design. This isn‚Äôt just something that can be done overnight; it requires experience to truly understand how to deliver this.
Why is design important?
Trust: Consumers generally trust familiarly and ‚Äúwell‚Äù designed products, not something your cousin Timmy whipped up. When you have to choose between two similar products in the Play Store, see if you feel more secure with the modernly designed product or the one that looks like a sub-reddit.
Design is key to audience ‚Äî Business to Consumer (B2C) needs to match the defined customer base, while Business to Business (B2B) is often a lot more forgiving with visuals. With a solid B2B product, teams generally feel they can get away with no design, but what about when a similar product with better design hits the market?
User Experience: Visual design is important ‚Äî but on its own it‚Äôs nothing more than eye-candy. The interface should be able to enhance the core functions and create a comfortable experience for your users.
When is design less important?
Minimal Viable Products (MVPs) don‚Äôt always need the same level of design refinement as full products. That doesn‚Äôt mean they should ignore design, but sometimes it‚Äôs better to spend resources testing and validating in a market first.
What does design actually provide, then?
In addition to the trust factor for your customers (which is hugely important), it creates a level of ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù in the general space ‚Äî meaning investors, friends, and family are more likely to believe in your product, as well as keeping competitors from choosing to join the market.
More importantly that appearance and assumptions, design is your chance to brand your product. Users are humans ‚Äî that means they‚Äôre going to respond emotionally to pretty much everything, including using your product. They‚Äôre going to feel frustrated, annoyed, grateful, impressed and have an internal conversation when they engage with software. It‚Äôs the moment your customers start having an emotional relationship with your company.
Design is when you get to make your audience feel ‚Äî wouldn‚Äôt you want to be in control of that dialogue?

It‚Äôs not the prettiest poster, but it has profound meaning.
So, what‚Äôs the message behind these numbers?
This simple equation says that:
Put in a fancier way:
And in an even fancier way:
Olympic athletes live by this. There are no shortcuts to the top and major breakthroughs happen after periods of small, but sustained growth.
There‚Äôs simply no way around hard-work.
It‚Äôs better for a bodybuilder to improve 1% every training session, than to have a sudden 10% increase in muscle mass. The ladder will usually result in imbalance (injury, diet sickness, hormonal mess, etc.).
Entrepreneurs also have this embedded in their work ethos.
Software development advances in terms of sprints: bite-sized, frequent iterations. For example, the Facebook app is updated every 2 weeks. New versions are just a tiny bit better than previous ones ‚Äî but within one year you‚Äôll have a way better Facebook than you did 12 months ago.
Not only is this practice helpful in the build-measure-learn-repeat product cycle, but it‚Äôs also beneficial to the end users, who are usually resistant to big change.
Even though 1% doesn‚Äôt sound like much, improving just 1% every day requires military discipline and a deep sense of commitment.
Try doing something small ‚Äî it can be anything ‚Äî every day for 365 days straight. It‚Äôs not easy. This is why diets, even though they can be very simple to understand, are very hard to follow through until the end.
Start with something little. The key is to not even think about it; it has to be like brushing your teeth. For most people (hopefully), brushing their teeth is an automatic action performed at the same time, same place, every day.
If it‚Äôs a book, make sure you write a page every day, just one page. If you want to get in shape, make sure to exercise every day. If you‚Äôre starting a business, make sure you write down that daily to-do list and not let go until every item has been done.
The key is to fill that list with bite-sized, actionable items that can be addresses immediately:
Commit to doing this for 3 days straight. Then 1 week. Then 1 month. And keep on incrementing, little by little. They say that a new habit is formed after 60 days of continuous behavior. After that, you‚Äôll pretty much get used to this.
Get it done.
The upside is that small improvements are less painful than big actions. Persistence and discipline can be trained like a muscle. That‚Äôs the beauty.
If you need money to go on vacation, it‚Äôs way easier to save just $3.00/day than to cough up a lump sum of $1,095 (*I recommend the Acorns app for this).
Bite-sized improvements are not as fun or glamorous as big changes. But trust me... in a year you‚Äôll look back and be impressed with how far you‚Äôve gone.

Dr. Cameron Sepah|20K|11|https://medium.com/s/company-culture/your-companys-culture-is-who-you-hire-fire-and-promote-c69f84902983?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|Your Company Culture is Who You Hire, Fire, and Promote|"Your Company Culture Is Who You Hire, Fire, and Promote
Use the Performance-Values Matrix to build an Outstanding Culture
Every time I walk into a new company I‚Äôm advising, I invariably encounter a set of noble values prominently displayed on the walls. The first thing I‚Äôve trained myself to do is to not take them as gospel, and instead carefully observe how people really behave, which will tell me the actual values I need to know.
It‚Äôs not that most companies are disingenuous about the values they espouse. One of Enron‚Äôs ‚Äúaspirational values‚Äù was integrity, which may have genuinely expressed who they wanted to be at the beginning. But over time, this proclaimed value didn‚Äôt reflect their ‚Äúpracticed values‚Äù which were revealed when they committed fraud.
Why does a gap usually exist between a company‚Äôs aspirational and practiced values? You would think that to alleviate cognitive dissonance, most employees would feel an inherent need to practice what they preach ‚Äî or are preached at to do. But to truly close the gap, you have to attack the problem at its root: The issue is that aspirational values almost always come from, and must be rectified at, the top.
According to the theory of behaviorism, no behavior will persist long term unless it is being perpetuated by either a positive reinforcer (providing a reward, such as a promotion or praise) or a negative reinforcer (removing a punishment, such as a probationary period or undesirable tasks). Thus, when companies start, leaders set the company‚Äôs values not by what they write on the walls, but by how they actually act. For example, do they stay late and burn the midnight oil? Or do they leave early to be with their families? According to social learning theory, these behaviors become socialized, and rank-and-file employees who take their cues from these leaders act, and react, accordingly. These are what‚Äôs called trickle-down behaviors.
As the company grows and senior leadership is not always readily observable, employees begin to act according to what their managers either actively reinforce through praise and promotion or passively reinforce by allowance. Over time, employees become aware of which colleagues are being hired, fired, or promoted, and why. Did Joe get hired because his references praised his incredible work ethic? Did Jill get fired because she wasn‚Äôt considered a team player? Did Jamie get promoted because he spent a lot of time socializing with company leadership? Hence, employees quickly learn the ‚Äúrules of the game‚Äù to survive and thrive at their company, and act accordingly, which may have nothing to do with what aspirational values are plastered on the walls.
Instead of letting your company become a corporate version of The Hunger Games, leadership should actively prioritize behavior that‚Äôs congruent with company values.
First, you must ensure that all final candidates live up to your company‚Äôs values. For example, I‚Äôve created an interview template to evaluate candidates on seven key traits: grit, rigor, impact, teamwork, ownership, curiosity, and polish. (I recommend you replace these with your own company‚Äôs aspirational values.)
Another key trait (or the lack thereof) has been popularized by Professor Bob Sutton at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The ‚ÄúNo Asshole Rule‚Äù dictates that no matter how great a candidate may be, being an asshole is an automatic deal breaker. The way this can be implemented is through what I call the ‚ÄúOne Red Flag Rule,‚Äù which is based on the observation that pathological traits are sporadically, not continually, expressed ‚Äî except in severe cases.
For example, a narcissistic candidate may not act arrogant all the time, but may express arrogant comments 10 times more, on average, than someone who doesn‚Äôt have this issue (e.g. a few times a day versus a few times a month). Thus, if a candidate can‚Äôt suppress making an arrogant comment during a 30‚Äì60 minute interview, they are likely to do this even more often when employed full-time.
Drawing on best practices espoused by a leading investing firm, Andreessen Horowitz, I conduct up to six reference checks per candidate to evaluate ‚Äúvalues fit.‚Äù
Nevertheless, evaluating these traits during a brief interview can be challenging and lead to an inaccurate assessment. This is why I recommend conducting thorough reference checks, based on research findings dictating that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.
A 300-employee San Francisco startup, Weebly, goes so far as to invite job candidates to work an onsite trial week, paid at fair market value. The reason is simple: It‚Äôs very hard to suppress values-incongruent behaviors when working closely with others for that amount of time. As Weebly‚Äôs CEO David Rusenko said:
No matter how good your interviewers are, any screener will result in false positives (people who you thought fit your values, but don‚Äôt once they‚Äôre hired) and false negatives (people who you thought would not fit your values, but would have if you had hired them). Companies that prioritize culture are willing to accept some false negatives in order to avoid false positives. If you get some false positives anyway, the solution, as entrepreneur and president of Y Combinator Sam Altman said, is to ‚Äúfire quickly.‚Äù Few people have the psychological wherewithal to resign of their own accord if they still want the job, but know they aren‚Äôt the right fit. That‚Äôs why baseball coaches have to pull starting pitchers out of the game when their performance declines, and substitute a relief pitcher instead. In the same way, it‚Äôs a manager‚Äôs job to be a good coach and pull people out, compassionately, so they can find a better fit in another role or company.
The major issue that I‚Äôve seen with startups is that even if they claim to have a ‚ÄúNo Asshole Rule,‚Äù they hardly ever practice it. Rationales I‚Äôve heard include: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve decided that we‚Äôre not going to fire him because he‚Äôs a high performer‚Äù or ‚Äúfor that one bad trait, he has four good traits going for him,‚Äù and, of course, the ‚Äú[data scientists/engineers/product managers] are hard to replace, so we‚Äôll make do.‚Äù
The best way to avoid this pitfall is to make values-congruent behavior a formal and prioritized part of your company‚Äôs performance management process. I‚Äôll share the system I designed and helped implement at my company. It starts with evaluating each employee on the Performance-Values Matrix. Whatever employee evaluation system you use ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs a formal annual review or regular one-on-ones ‚Äî employees should be evaluated on both their performance-based behavior and values-based behavior. Both should be quantified on a spectrum (e.g. a 1‚Äì10 point scale), but I‚Äôve simplified into a 2x2 matrix for illustrative purposes. (Note: I use gender-neutral language throughout this piece, but I use ‚Äúguys‚Äù in the matrix due to space constraints. I also usually use more PC terms, but the colorful language helps me cheekily make my point here.)
Incompetent assholes are not only low-performers, but their behavior is incongruent with company values. In this matrix, they are in the lower-left quadrant and thus can only earn 25 percent of the maximum employee evaluation score. Hopefully, there should be very few of these folks at your company, but occasionally a few will slip through the hiring cracks, or something may have happened that caused performance and values-congruent behavior to permanently degrade over time. Nevertheless, they sap overall employee motivation by not contributing equally to the workload and are toxic to company morale. Needless to say, incompetent assholes should be identified and fired as fast as possible.
Competent assholes are high-performers, but exhibit behavioral tendencies that are incongruent with company values. Given that ‚Äúasshole‚Äù is not a clinical term, I will define it here as someone who lacks empathetic behavior to the point that it causes interpersonal issues. The biggest mistake that I see companies make is that they retain competent assholes because they are seen as critical to the company or difficult to replace. However, by doing so, they not only passively reinforce the competent asshole‚Äôs behavior by tolerating and promoting them, but they implicitly send the message to the rest of the company that you can basically get away with murder so long as leadership believes you to be indispensable. You can imagine what kind of culture this creates over time. In contrast, using the Performance-Values Matrix, an employee who‚Äôs competent but a complete asshole can only earn 50 percent of the maximum employee evaluation score, given that the other 50 percent of their evaluation is based on their values-congruent behavior.
There‚Äôs a reason Professor Sutton called it the ‚ÄúNo Asshole Rule.‚Äù It‚Äôs because exceptions shouldn‚Äôt be made, otherwise it shows your values are merely aspirational. The solution for competent assholes is a tactic that I call ‚Äúremediate or separate.‚Äù Despite the fact that these folks are strong performers, it should be made clear that value-incongruent behavior is not tolerated and they will need to remediate their behavior in a measurable way within a given period of time.
Thus, competent assholes should be put on what I call a ‚ÄúValues Improvement Plan‚Äù (VIP). For this, 360-degree reviews ‚Äî from an employee‚Äôs manager, peers and direct reports ‚Äî are a great way to assess improvement, or else be separated from the company. The reason I like giving these folks a chance is that sometimes employees that aren‚Äôt entirely inflexible (or pathological) can improve when they realize that their job depends on it. Often times, this requires entering therapy or executive coaching with a skilled psychologist, which is worth its weight in gold if the employee is willing to change.
Incompetent nice guys and gals are the exemplars of your culture and are well-liked by almost everyone, but unfortunately are not high-performers. Like competent assholes, completely incompetent nice guys and gals also can only earn a 50 percent maximum possible employee rating. That‚Äôs because it is nearly as much of a sin to tolerate incompetent people as it is to tolerate assholes. Giving free license to someone to underperform just because they are kind or likeable sends the message that your company is not a meritocracy, and that it‚Äôs more important to be socially skilled (or at worst, be a brown noser). However, the solution here is different than with component assholes, in that the best solution is to manage or move them.
Incompetent nice guys and gals should be put on a traditional performance improvement plan (PIP), and skillfully managed in order to give them training and feedback to improve their abilities. When their incompetence stems from a fundamental disconnect between their strengths and their current role‚Äôs demands (e.g. mediocre social skills in a client-facing role) one solution I‚Äôve seen prove fruitful is to move them into a different role. (The person may be an analytical whiz if moved to a more technical role). Of course, if that is not possible or does not work out, they should also be separated from the company. Encouraging incompetent nice guys and gals find a position that‚Äôs a better fit for their strengths is, ironically, the nicest thing you can do for them.
Hopefully most of the employees at your company are both competent and nice; you must exhibit both behaviors in order to be in the top-right quadrant of the Performance-Values Matrix. Competent nice guys and gals earn up to 75 percent of the maximum employee evaluation score, and should be both praised and given the opportunity for advancement. But in order to set the bar high, employees should only earn the full 100 percent score if they exhibit both outstanding performance and value-congruent behavior. They are what Sarah Tavel of venture capital firm Greylock Partners calls the ‚Äúmitochondria‚Äù of startups, because they are the company‚Äôs power plants ‚Äî adding value beyond their job description by asking and doing what is best for the company.
Given how rare these individuals are, founders should go out of their way to attract and retain them. By building this designation directly into the evaluation matrix, outstanding nice guys and gals should be formally recognized and rewarded with raises and promotions. These are the current or future leaders of your company, and need to be nurtured and cherished given that they are the foundation for your company‚Äôs performance and morale.
Of note, while I distinguish between competent and outstanding nice guys [and gals] in the matrix, I do not do so for assholes. That‚Äôs because I believe it is nearly impossible to be an outstanding asshole. For example, there is a myth of the ‚Äú10x engineer‚Äù in Silicon Valley, where a truly talented engineer is 10 times as valuable and productive as an average engineer. Even if one engineer could possibly do the work of 10, if they are an asshole ‚Äî especially in a management position ‚Äî they will decrease the performance of the people around them to such an extent that their team‚Äôs net productivity will break even or be at a loss long-term.
When leaders become Machiavellian and hire and retain mercenary employees, they resemble a Hermann Hesse novel reaching ‚Äúthe ‚Äúplace on the journey where everything falls apart‚Äù and the company‚Äôs culture degrades. While company engagement scores typically decline as they scale ‚Äî given they have to hire quickly from a limited talent pool and are too overworked to fire quickly ‚Äî this does not have to be an inevitable outcome.
Culture can only improve when there‚Äôs a baseline of openness, where people feel they can come forward and share concerns or opportunities for people and teams to do better. If people don‚Äôt trust what happens after they give their feedback, then reviews will be ‚Äúpositive‚Äù and not provide any useful information. This requires both anonymous surveys and the promise that aggregate feedback is valued and will be acted upon.
So if you want your company‚Äôs culture to be congruent with those noble aspirations written on your walls, you must continually assess how well your employees are behaving compared to those aspirational values, and develop ways to bridge the gap between aspiration and practice. I believe the best way to do this is to directly reinforce value-driven behavior, including making it an integral part of employee‚Äôs reviews and weighting it as highly as performance.

Preethi Kasireddy|70K|12|https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|Why I‚Äôm leaving Silicon Valley ‚Äì Preethi Kasireddy ‚Äì Medium|"Here‚Äôs something I never thought I‚Äôd say: this is my last week in Silicon Valley.
This post is a personal one. Rather than sharing insights on Blockchain or Javascript, I‚Äôd like to walk through my inner journey the past few years.
It‚Äôs a journey that‚Äôs left me itching for change ‚Äî and driving down to Los Angeles to set up a new home base is a big one!
I moved to Silicon Valley during the summer of 2012, a little over five years ago. I had just graduated college and serendipitously landed here because of a new job offer. I was eager and anxious to start my career out here and frankly had no idea what to expect.
As it turned out, I lucked out ‚Äî Silicon Valley is one of the best places in the world for entrepreneurs, engineers, and anyone bold enough to try and change the world through technology.
...This was a stark contrast to life in my New Jersey hometown, where most people went to the community college, pursued 9-to-5 jobs, and settled into comfortable lives by their mid-20s. There was very little space there for thinking big, or taking risks, or creating your own career path.
So, landing in San Francisco was the best kind of culture shock imaginable. Suddenly, I was surrounded by technology and innovation and immersed in a community where challenging yourself was actually encouraged.
The next three years of living in San Francisco had a path-altering impact on my life, as I began to learn that crazy ideas aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù for those of us willing to put in the work and take a few risks.
That first post-college job was as an analyst at Goldman Sachs, where I was able to learn how tech company financials work at a fundamental level through working with CEOs and CFOs preparing for IPO rounds and acquisitions. This was hugely beneficial when I later moved on to working with some of those tech companies directly, and planted the seeds of my interest in solving problems with software.
After a year at Goldman Sachs, however, I realized that a career in banking was not what I wanted long term. I wanted to go back to being an engineer as I had been in college. So I decided to go against the grain and say goodbye to a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù position. Where was I off to next?
Well, I was on the brink of leaving to join as a systems engineer for a small industrial startup in the middle of the country. But after a random cold email followed by a long series of unexpected events, I got an offer to join Andreessen Horowitz on the deal team. It was an opportunity I couldn‚Äôt pass up ‚Äî and thank God I didn‚Äôt.
I spent the next two years at Andreessen Horowitz, where I worked with and learned from the pioneers of the web, like Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, Chris Dixon, and many others. I saw thousands of companies come through the doors ‚Äî I saw their ideas, their teams, their challenges and their strengths. I learned the ins and outs of building a successful technology startup, and on the flip side, learned the common mistakes that lead to failure. Most importantly, I met incredible entrepreneurs who inspired me to also become like them one day.
When I left a16z, I made the transition to software engineering. I was young and wanted to go out and just build stuff for the world. You could say that I had ‚Äúentrepreneur envy‚Äù ‚Äî I was eager to build products day to day, and eventually start my own company. I‚Äôve written about my experience extensively in the past.
This transition was nothing short of amazing. I was learning and growing at a break-neck pace. I was passionate and excited by my work. Frankly, I was having so much fun being an engineer that not a single day felt like ‚Äúwork‚Äù.
But beyond just loving my work, I also felt empowered. Empowered to do things I never thought were possible before. Because being an engineer gave me freedom. Freedom to build anything I want, whenever I want and wherever I want. The freedom to learn how everything works at a fundamental level. The freedom to teach and empower new developers. And most importantly, the freedom to be a creator and literally, create something from nothing.
It was only after I left Andreessen Horowitz to return to an engineering track that my feelings about life in Silicon Valley started to change.
Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world ‚Äî Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea ‚Äî and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn‚Äôt the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening.
What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
This isn‚Äôt exactly a surprise, since one of the Internet‚Äôs core functions is to make access to knowledge available everywhere. I personally taught myself almost everything I know about programming on the internet (outside some fundamentals from Hack Reactor), for free. And I‚Äôm just one of thousands of learners using the Internet to access information that used to be limited to elite colleges like Stanford, Berkeley, or MIT.
These days, techies aren‚Äôt limited to Silicon Valley if they want to find funding and a community. Many other cities with active and relevant tech scenes have their own unique cultures, art, cuisines, and activities to offer.
Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I‚Äôm not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately.
What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story ‚Äî whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered... but within the Valley, you‚Äôd hear the same stories over and over.
Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I‚Äôd overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing ‚Äî the like-mindedness ‚Äî was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking ‚Äî group think as they call it.
Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.
This isn‚Äôt to say Silicon Valley hasn‚Äôt taught me anything important.
It‚Äôs been a perfect place to learn to take risks. A place to learn the value of creating your own path, and to prove to myself that I can do it.
While living here, I‚Äôve made a deliberate effort to say yes to my dreams. I wanted the freedom to build anything I want, and I earned that. I wanted to learn and grow as quickly as possible, and I‚Äôve proven that. I wanted to meet people from around the world and learn from them, and I got that. I wanted to find my purpose instead of following a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù path, and I did that.
Most importantly, I wanted to pave a path that is unique to me, and I‚Äôm doing exactly that. I‚Äôm only a couple years into it, and the future feels unlimited.
Looking back, when I left Andreessen Horowitz to pursue this path, I set out a three-part roadmap for myself:
I spent the past two years learning many different areas of programming (e.g. web development, mobile development, distributed systems, etc.) and various application areas (e.g. machine learning, blockchain, etc.). I purposely stayed broad and exposed myself to as much as possible, and learned to code things that interested me most. Eventually, I fell in love with blockchain development.
My fascination with blockchains started when we first made the investment in Coinbase at a16z, and ever since, I‚Äôve been keeping up with the technology and eventually joined Coinbase as a software engineer, which helped me further dive deeper into the space. After Coinbase, I continued to tinker and teach myself various aspects of blockchain, and now I‚Äôm at phase two, where I‚Äôm focusing on getting really good at it. The next step is to use my skills to ‚Äúbuild a world-changing company or something else entirely‚Äù.
Leading the path I want to lead doesn‚Äôt require me to be in Silicon valley anymore. I don‚Äôt need to be here to follow my personal roadmap. Having the freedom of an engineer to learn and grow as an entrepreneur, writer, and speaker has opened me up to a whole new world. It made me realize that I can be an engineer, entrepreneur, writer and speaker from anywhere in the world.
The world is becoming increasingly global. Silicon Valley is just one way of living. One way of thinking. One way of viewing the world. But there‚Äôs so many other ways. Because after all, technology is global, engineering is global, innovation is global and entrepreneurship is global.
It‚Äôs evident by the fact that we now see countries like India and China leap frog generations of western technology and even inventing their own ways ‚Äî take mPesa in Kenya, Paytm in India, or WeChat in China.
Moreover, it‚Äôs become easier than ever to connect with anyone thousands of miles away. Being physically present is no longer a requirement. I can code from South Africa and still ship a product to someone in Silicon Valley.
Beyond this, what really nudged me was when I realized that the blockchain revolution is global. I‚Äôve spent the past year doing research and development in blockchain technologies, and noticed that many cities outside of the valley, like New York, Berlin, Toronto, Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Bangkok, are making immense strides in pushing blockchains forward. Many well known projects and efforts to bring blockchain to the masses are being started from places outside of Silicon Valley. For once, I noticed that Silicon Valley isn‚Äôt the center of it.
So then a crazy idea came to my head. Can I leave Silicon Valley and still pursue my dreams? Can I still build a massive and world-changing company? Can I still make a big impact in this world?
The answer to that increasingly became a clear yes.
Of course, there‚Äôs a strong argument for staying in Silicon Valley. After all, this place has a massive network of entrepreneurs and people who ‚Äúget it‚Äù. This place knows how to breed amazing startups. Moreover, I‚Äôve personally built up a great network in Silicon Valley over the past five years. I could easily stay and lead a very successful life here, financially at least.
But frankly, I don‚Äôt want to. That feels a bit too easy. I‚Äôm young, passionate, and driven ‚Äî I can‚Äôt let inertia, familiarity, comfort or money hold me back from going on to to doing bigger and harder things. I‚Äôm going to challenge myself. I‚Äôm going to fight for my goals. To work day and night for them. And money isn‚Äôt going to get me any of these things.
Money has never been my main motivator. I left Goldman Sachs before my first-year bonus because I was too eager to sit back for two months hating my life, instead of starting my new career at a16z. Then I left an amazing career at a16z to go become a developer. Challenge and impact are what gets me out of bed in the morning.
I have this burning desire to do even more, see more and experience more, outside of Silicon Valley. When the opportunity exists to experience a whole new city and still do what I love, why not just go out there and try? Why not try to expose myself to ideas in a place where the opportunities are wide open? Why not meet other types of people, learn other skills, and live on the edge a little?
Here I am: ready to do exactly that!
Perhaps my feeling and frustrations towards Silicon Valley and San Francisco are merely a fact of being here for too long. Perhaps they‚Äôre just from me needing a change. Perhaps they‚Äôre just from finding my true calling as an engineer, builder, writer and entrepreneur and realizing that I can do that from anywhere.
I‚Äôm ready to pick up my bags and embark onto the next adventure in Los Angeles.
Am I scared?
Hell yeah I‚Äôm scared.
I know practically no one in Los Angeles except for a few college friends who I haven‚Äôt spoken to in years. While on one hand, this sounds scary, on the other hand, I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôm beyond ecstatic to get out there and build up my network from ground up, just like I have done for the past five years in Silicon Valley.
And the best part is, I can always come back here ‚Äî for a day, a week or a month. Silicon Valley is where my entire network is, and they aren‚Äôt going anywhere. If I come back a year, or two years, or even five years from now, most of them will still be here.
So why the heck would I choose Los Angeles of all places? Lots of reasons!
Of course, every city has it‚Äôs flaws. Let‚Äôs not even get into the traffic situation in LA ;)
As some of you may know, I‚Äôve been heavily focused in the blockchain space for a while now. I hope to share more details about my next project in the coming months.
In the meantime, look out for more updates from me, whether it‚Äôs posts to teach you blockchain, videos for my #AskPreethi series, or pictures of me sitting on Venice beach with my laptop being a nerd and coding üòé
Still here? Good! Here‚Äôs the mic. Have you ever made a ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù move to chase something you wanted? Tell me about it in the comments so we can keep the fire going!
Blockchain Engineer. I have a passion for understanding things at a fundamental level and sharing it as clearly as possible.

Benjamin P. Hardy|38K|5|https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/this-30-day-challenge-will-transform-your-identity-and-explode-your-success-813a76427652?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|How To Change Your Life In 30 Days ‚Äì Benjamin P. Hardy ‚Äì Medium|"Your identity is not fixed, but highly fluid.
Your identity follows your behaviors.
How does this work?
It works based on two very important psychological concepts:
Both of these ideas are strongly related to other research in psychology, which suggests that behaviors generally come BEFORE psychological states. Again, this goes against most common wisdom.
My favorite example is the research on self-efficacy (confidence), which shows that confidence isn‚Äôt what produces high performance. But rather, that high performance is what produces confidence.
Put simply, if you want to have confidence, you can have it. All you have to do is behave in desired ways, even for a short period of time.
Why does all of this matter?
It matters, because you have the power to radically change your identity.
Even at a biological level, new science in epigenetics and neuroplasticity is showing how malleable and fluid our biology is.
Most people plateau.
Even successful people.
It‚Äôs actually very common for people who are succeeding to get stuck.
Think about some of your favorite authors, musicians, and even companies.
At some point, they generally stop being as innovative.
We all have that band we love, whose first album or two had way more soul. Then, once they became famous, their music became far more tame.
The same is often true of world-class chefs.
Once a restaurant becomes highly successful, they usually stop innovating the menu as much.
Once something is working, it‚Äôs hard to go back to ground zero.
In psychological terms, your motivation can go from approach-oriented to avoid-oriented.
Specifically, all goals are either offensive or defensive.
If you‚Äôre seeking to advance your current position, you‚Äôre ‚Äúapproaching.‚Äù
If you‚Äôre seeking to maintain your position, or avoid something bad from happening, you‚Äôre ‚Äúavoiding.‚Äù
When you‚Äôre approaching, you‚Äôre less concerned about risks and more focused on rewards. You‚Äôre willing to take risks. You‚Äôre willing to fail. You‚Äôre being PULLED forward.
When you‚Äôre avoiding, you‚Äôre less concerned about the rewards and more focused on the risks. And you have no desire to proactively confront those risks. Instead, you‚Äôre simply trying to shield yourself from any problems that come your way.
I‚Äôve seen this with many of my role models. For example, some of my favorite authors have shifted from approach-oriented to avoid-oriented.
I can see it in their work.
It‚Äôs become far more safe.
They are making far less significant ideological attempts in their writing. Their books are becoming more mainstream. Obviously calculated and less intuitive and inspired.
When you begin succeeding, your focus can shift from WHY to WHAT. Instead of operating from your core, your simply try to maintain success.
This is how you get stuck.
This is how you get confused and lose your identity.
Are you on offense or defense?
Are you approaching or avoiding?
Are you proactively becoming the person you want to be?
Or are you holding on to the person you think you are?
In the brilliant Netflix documentary, Chef‚Äôs Table, which highlights the lives of the world‚Äôs most successful chefs, one particular episode stands out.
The number one chef in Asia, Gaggan Anand, is known for spontaneously throwing out his entire menu and starting from scratch. Even when his current menu is getting lots of attention.
This may not seem like a big deal, but it is.
When a restaurant starts getting recognized and certain awards, it‚Äôs generally based on the menu and overall atmosphere.
Being literally number one in Asia, it would make sense for Gaggan to keep his restaurant how it is.
But that‚Äôs not what he does.
Creativity, and always pushing his own boundaries, is what he is about.
So just because something is working doesn‚Äôt give him permission to stop evolving.
So he reinvents himself.
Over and over and over.
No matter how hard it is to walk away from something brilliant.
A true creator never stops pushing their boundaries.
They never stop reinventing.
Once you become awesome at something, use your new LEARNING ABILITIES to become awesome at something else.
The whole notion of ‚Äúfinding your calling‚Äù has led people to having fixed views of themselves.
There isn‚Äôt just one thing you were born to do.
You can expand and grow in countless ways. Especially after you learn the process of learning. You can take all of your experience becoming great at something, and quickly become proficient at something else.
In this way, you never plateau. You‚Äôre always growing and evolving as a person.
Given that your identity is fluid and malleable, you have an amazing opportunity to redefine who you are.
All you have to do is consistently and boldly reshape your behavior.
You can do this in the form of a 30-day challenge.
What‚Äôs something you‚Äôve wanted to do, that you haven‚Äôt done?
Or, what‚Äôs something that would clearly lead you to a place you‚Äôd like to be?
It could be 30 days of extreme health and fitness.
That would definitely change things.
It could be facing an extreme fear: like 30 days of asking people on dates.
It could be 30 days of writing articles, or filming videos.
Whatever it is, if you do it for 30 days, your identity will change.
Your fears will become cauterized and neutralized.
You‚Äôll adapt to your new behaviors.
Your psychological state will change.
You‚Äôll begin to identify with your new behaviors.
Will you have to deal with some negative emotions along the way?
Will you face a load of resistance and fear?
Will you want to quit?
The answer is probably yes to all of those questions.
But THIS is how you separate yourself from the masses.
This is how you make quantum leaps in your progression, while most people make incremental progress.
This is how you consciously shape your identity and future.
Where will you be in 30 days from now?
WHO will you be 30 days from now?
I‚Äôve created a cheat sheet for putting yourself into a PEAK-STATE, immediately. You follow this daily, your life will change very quickly.
Get the cheat sheet here!

Tristan Handy|2.7K|12|https://thinkgrowth.org/the-startup-founders-guide-to-analytics-1d2176f20ac1?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|The Startup Founder‚Äôs Guide to Analytics ‚Äì ThinkGrowth.org|"You need analytics.
I‚Äôm very confident of that, because today, everyone needs analytics. Not just product, not just marketing, not just finance... sales, fulfillment, everyone at a startup needs analytics today. Analytics powers every decision, from the strategic to the tactical, from the board room to your line level employees.
This post is about how to create the analytics competency at your organization. It‚Äôs not about what metrics to track (there are plenty of good posts about that), it‚Äôs about how to actually get your business to produce them. As it turns out, the implementation question ‚Äî How do I build a business that produces actionable data?‚Äîis much harder to answer.
And the answer is changing fast. The analytics ecosystem is moving very quickly, and the options you have at your disposal have changed significantly in the past 24 months. This post reflects recommendations and experience with the data technology of 2017.
I‚Äôve spent the better part of two decades working in analytics. In that time, I‚Äôve seen plenty of things go well, but a lot more go poorly. I spent the early part of my career implementing legacy enterprise BI (ugh). I built Squarespace‚Äôs first analytics competency from 2009‚Äì2010 and raised massive A round with the data. I was then COO of Argyle Social, a social media analytics startup, and subsequently VP Marketing at RJMetrics, a leading BI platform for startups.
Now I spend my days helping startup execs implement analytics as the CEO and Founder of Fishtown Analytics. At Fishtown, we start working with companies who have raised an A round and help them build their internal analytics competency as they grow. We‚Äôve been through the exact process I‚Äôm going to describe in this article with over a dozen companies at this point, including Casper, SeatGeek, and Code Climate.
I‚Äôm going to walk you through, stage by stage, how your startup should be doing analytics. At each stage, my recommendations are going to answer to the question ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the absolute least I can get away with?‚Äù We‚Äôre not here to build castles in the sky; we need answers as cheaply as possible.
Let‚Äôs do it.
At this stage, you have no resources and no time. There are a million things you could be measuring, but you‚Äôre so close to the details of your business that you‚Äôre actually able to make fairly good instinctual decisions. The one thing you need to make sure you are measuring is your product, because it‚Äôs your product metrics that will help you iterate quickly in this critical phase. Everything else can take a back seat.
If you‚Äôre not technical, you may need an engineer to help out with GA and event tracking. This entire exercise shouldn‚Äôt take more than an hour or two, including reading the docs. It‚Äôs worth it to take the time out of building for this.
Everything that is not one of the things above. Do not let someone sell you a data warehouse, a BI platform, a big consulting project, or...yeah, you get it. Stay focused. When you make a commitment to analytics, there is an ongoing cost. Data changes. Business logic changes. Once you start down this road, you can‚Äôt really put the project on pause. Wait to make this investment until later.
There will be many questions that you just can‚Äôt answer yet. That‚Äôs fine (for now).
You‚Äôre growing your team a bit. These people need data to do their jobs. They may or may not be data experts, and you need to make sure that they‚Äôre doing the basic things right.
It‚Äôs still too early for a data warehouse and for SQL-based analytics‚Äîit just takes too much time. You need to spend all of your time doing, not analyzing, and the most straightforward way to do that is to use the built-in reporting capabilities of the various SaaS products you‚Äôre using to run your business. You also shouldn‚Äôt hire a full-time analyst yet. There are more important things to spend your limited funds on at this point.
This is where things get interesting, and where the changes in the past two years really start to become apparent. Once you‚Äôve raised your A round and have 20+ employees you start to have new options.
These options are all driven by one thing: analytics tech is getting better, fast. Previously this type of infrastructure was reserved for much larger companies. Its benefits? More reliable metrics, more flexibility, and a better platform for future growth.
This stage is potentially the most challenging. You still have a relatively small team and few resources, but you‚Äôre being asked to deliver increasingly sophisticated and diverse analytics to the business, and your work can directly impact the success or failure of the company as a whole. No pressure.
It‚Äôs important to make forward progress here while making sure that you continue to lay the groundwork for future phases of your growth. The decisions you make in this phase can cause you to charge straight into a brick wall if you don‚Äôt think hard about the future.
It‚Äôs easy to get carried away with yourself and begin investing in heavy-duty data infrastructure. Don‚Äôt do this. At this stage, major infrastructure investments are still an expensive distraction. Here are some suggestions on how to stay agile:
Avoiding expensive boondoggles will keep you focused on solving real business problems.
This stage is all about creating analytics processes that scale. You need to balance getting answers that you need today with implementing analytics practices that will scale as you continue growing your team.
At 150 employees you‚Äôll probably only have a small team (3‚Äì6) full-time focused on analytics. By the time you have 500 employees you could easily have 30 or more. 3‚Äì6 analysts can operate in a fairly ad-hoc manner, exchanging knowledge (and code) informally. By the time you have 8+ analysts, this begins to break down very quickly.
If you don‚Äôt manage this transition well, you‚Äôll actually perform less well as your team grows: it will take you longer to produce meaningful insights, and your answers will be of lower quality. This is simply a function of non-linear complexity: you‚Äôll have more data being produced and more analysts working with it. In order to combat this, you need processes to keep them working together reliably.
Don‚Äôt accept excuses. Doing analytics right at this level is hard work, and it requires a talented and motivated team that is constantly innovating and improving. Code reviews take time and energy. Analysts aren‚Äôt used to having to test their code. And documentation is painstaking. There will be resistance to doing things this way, especially among your long-term team members who remember the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù. But as complexity increases, you need to evolve your processes to adapt.
These processes will actually make analytics easier, faster, and more reliable, but implementing them will feel like pulling teeth. If you‚Äôre serious about scaling analytics, you‚Äôll push through.
I‚Äôve come to each one of these recommendations after years of doing it myself within companies and now scaling the approach as a consultant. The opportunity to work with a range of similar clients has made it incredibly clear just how rare it is for companies to do this stuff well.
If you take all of the recommendations in this post, you will literally be one of the highest-functioning analytics organizations in the world. Not a bad competitive advantage.

However, good intentions mean nothing. You can‚Äôt pay your bills with good intentions. We know that making a living is hard. And living a great life is even more difficult.
So every day we hustle, work hard, and do our best to get closer to our dreams.
But how do you know that you‚Äôre on the right path? How do you know that you‚Äôre not wasting your time?
Well, you might not be a fortune teller. But I have an exercise for you that predicts your future accurately.
That‚Äôs the whole exercise. Let me explain.
No matter what you want to achieve in life, your actions must back up your words. If not, you will never achieve anything.
For instance, I desire to always work for myself. And at the same time have enough money in the bank to support my lifestyle. Put simply: I want to stay independent. Financially, spiritually, mentally. And in addition to that, I want to stay fit.
All I have to do now is look at my actions. I ask myself, ‚ÄúSo you want to be independent, huh? What does that take?‚Äù
I can go on for a while. But you get the point. I‚Äôm questioning my habits here. It‚Äôs not about what you want ‚Äî it‚Äôs about what you do.
And not in the future. Today.
I can honestly look myself in the mirror and answer yes to all those things now. But I also must be honest. I haven‚Äôt always lived this way. I didn‚Äôt take learning seriously for years. I didn‚Äôt invest in my skills. I didn‚Äôt exercise enough. I didn‚Äôt save my money. Etc, etc, etc.
And still, I keep adding new things to my daily habits. For example, I only recently started with tracking what I‚Äôve learned per month. And, there are a lot of other things that I can do better.
Realize that you can only focus on one thing at a time. So you can‚Äôt do everything today.
However, what you do today does impact your future.
Obviously, I‚Äôm not a fortune teller. But this predicting is easy. Anyone with a little common sense can do it. And it works like a charm.
Look at it this way. What useful and helpful things are you doing today?
The point is that all those little useful things like reading books, taking courses, making tough calls, sending emails, looking at real estate, going for a walk, spending quality time with people you love, ALL ADD UP.
But when you do useless things, they add up to nothing. Don‚Äôt believe me?
What does watching Game Of Thrones, eating a box of Oreo‚Äôs, and complaining about your day add up to? Well, maybe a heart attack. But that‚Äôs not good.
You get the point. Let‚Äôs do something useful every day. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying.
This was my useful thing for today. What‚Äôs yours?
There‚Äôs one question at the core of my work: How can we live a useful life that matters? http://dariusforoux.com/

Abhinav Chhikara|1K|7|https://medium.com/@abhinavchhikara/were-shutting-down-lisn-84758dfce2c4?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|We‚Äôre shutting down Lisn ‚Äì Abhinav Chhikara ‚Äì Medium|"In August 2016, we launched Lisn. We started as a hackathon project, and in a couple of months, we‚Äôd built something that we loved using. Here was an app that let you listen to music with a friend in a chat room, almost like you were in the same room. We used it everyday and loved the experience.
Our launch revealed that people loved it too. In the first month, we were covered by international publications (including TechCrunch and Wired), hit #2 trending on ProductHunt, and saw over 2k people share over 20k songs and many moments together on the app.
And these numbers kept growing. The app spread via word of mouth in college campuses and offices. Friends used it to recommend music to each other, long distance couples used it to stay connected, and musicians used it to collaborate.
From launch to today, over 120,000 songs have been streamed by over 8,000 people. We‚Äôve received highly encouraging messages, stories of how people are using Lisn, and countless bug reports and feature requests.
We spent a couple months figuring out what to do next and deconstructing what went wrong. Doing a post mortem on a product you‚Äôve worked on for more than a year is hard, but it helps get closure and make you really think about what you‚Äôve learned.
I like to think about it in terms of things within our control and things that we had limited or no control over. The former is something that can be solved as you grow as a person and get better at your craft. The latter is something you learn to live with, not to be stressed by, and eventually solve when the time is right.
We thought of product market fit (PMF) and retention very closely. If people are coming back to the app a lot, there‚Äôs a PMF. If not, then we haven‚Äôt cracked PMF yet.
Over time, we realized that the two were related but separate issues. The fact that we were steadily receiving ~100 downloads per week for months, and feature requests every week was a sign of good product market fit.
Retention however, is about first finding the qualities that the most active users have and what keeps them coming back. Our weekly active users stayed constant at ~200 people for months. Once you identify what your super users are doing, you have two options:
The five of us on the team had amazing, horizontal experiences building products for Indian and global consumers. In our individual freelance experiences, we had worked with founders in Silicon Valley, startup hubs in Europe and in India on building MVPs.
We also held full-time roles in companies like Housing.com, PayTM and Airtel Wynk which are companies known for their well designed, successful products.
On paper, we had amazing product building experience. What we lacked however, was taking products and scaling them.
We could always work on new features and respond to feature requests, but our approach was always from the lens of product design rather than the systematic lens of analytics driven product improvement. We were always super close, and sometimes made the right moves too, but we never had the solid direction to understand how to approach retention and keep iterating to fix it.
We learned a lot by doing, but we didn‚Äôt have these skills from the start. And by the end of it, we were burned out.
The number #1 thing everyone tells you when building a music product, is not to build a music startup. How there have been no successful music products. Even Spotify and SoundCloud, two of the biggest players aren‚Äôt making money and are constantly in turmoil.
One VC even said to me, ‚ÄúThe Music Industry and the Travel Industry seem to be graveyards for smart, passionate entrepreneurs.‚Äù
Now you can listen to this advice, read the articles and thinkpieces and stop what you‚Äôre doing, OR do it anyway and figure it out for yourself.
We were compared to Turntable.fm and others, but the problems they faced were very different from the problems we faced. And that‚Äôs only natural, the music industry has changed a lot in the past 5‚Äì10 years.
Problems music startups faced five years ago are obviously not the same problems music startups will face now. A lot of doors have been unlocked, but there are now newer doors with tighter locks.
We‚Äôve had the opportunity to directly talk to artists, execs at music labels, music promotion agencies, streaming services and even telecom companies that want to make a play in music. We definitely have a much better idea of the music industry after working on Lisn.
We received a couple acquisition offers from different players too, but nothing seemed like the best way forward for Lisn.
What we‚Äôve found is that the best way to solve these problems is from the inside, rather than from the outside. Lisn solved a problem but it wasn‚Äôt one that was big enough.
Vibhas spent a couple months in San Francisco with General Assembly, and met multiple entrepreneurs there to learn from them. With Lisn, he started as an interaction designer but is now an iOS developer too. He is currently at Entrepreneur First in Singapore, working on his new startup, Cryptosquad.
Abheyraj spent some time freelancing as an iOS developer, building apps. With Lisn, he began to explore product design and made a lot of contributions, including our app icon! He now works as a designer in Berlin for GoEuro.
Bhargav started in Lisn as a full-stack developer with ML/AI research experience. He learnt what it takes to build consumer apps and how to think in terms of value provided to people rather than tech solutions. He is currently a part of Entrepreneur First and is working on his new startup, MediosTech.
Tejas joined us towards the last few months of our journey to build our Android app and we got to a really good point. Unfortunately it was too late for Lisn and the app never made it beyond a small beta. He is currently working on interesting fintech and fraud detection problems with one of the world‚Äôs biggest online poker companies, PokerStars.
I learned how to get people excited about what you‚Äôre building and how to seed your first few thousand users. I‚Äôm currently leading the design team at Unacademy and writing a book on freelancing called Pajama Profit.
The point of a startup, or of building a team is to make something bigger than you could individually. Working together, your impact isn‚Äôt just the sum of your skills, it‚Äôs way more than that (1+1!=2). At Lisn, we not only learned how to be better at our core skills, but also learned a whole lot from each other.
The point is to build a collective that together can have a huge impact. The moment that ceases to be true, and 1+1<2, it‚Äôs a better idea to go back to working solo or with a collective that could use your impact.
Each of us learned a great deal at Lisn, but at the moment, our skills are better suited to make an impact elsewhere. But if ever in the future, any of us needs to build a product and the moment is right, we know who to turn to.
Lisn‚Äôs servers will be shut down on August 31st, 2017.

Promise Phelon|447|6|https://thinkgrowth.org/every-ceo-needs-to-self-manage-heres-my-advice-on-how-to-do-it-ef81345ba0eb?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|Every CEO Needs to Self-Manage. Here‚Äôs My Advice On How To Do It.|"The West Coast is a unique culture, thriving ecosystem, and major economy in its own right, but one that often feels like an echo chamber. Everyone speaks the same tech language, and shares similar assumptions when dealing with challenges and opportunities. This isn‚Äôt good or bad, but it is a style that is different from many places.
Exactly two years ago, I was offered an amazing opportunity to be the CEO of TapInfluence, a technology company leading the emerging category of influencer marketing. I took it and relocated to Boulder, Colorado. Taking the job came with significant goals. I needed to make changes, specifically to disrupt the company‚Äôs managed service revenue and delivery model.
Ultimately, these business changes were successful. We raised a significant round of funding in 2016 and within another year, more than quadrupled the company‚Äôs valuation. But these changes were not without their challenges.
Running a company outside of the Valley was a major adjustment. It was an introduction to a new work culture that necessitated a different network of investors, CEO colleagues, and mentors. Despite the good things happening with the company‚Äôs core business, it was blatantly clear that this was a turnaround, and I was very much the ‚Äúoutsider-CEO.‚Äù
As I led this challenging and disruptive endeavor, I took a new approach to personal self-management. It was one that emerged from a need for deep self-reflection, new mechanisms for time management, and lots of collaboration with several CEOs who not only led turnarounds but who also had experience outside their chosen industry and desired work cultures. During this time of transition, reflection and introspection versus reaction were key.
At the same time, winning can also be a bit of an ego trip. For me, it was time to let go of ego, take the focus off of me, and create a discipline wherein I could learn from all my experiences. This discipline helped me to shift my perspective and connect with the business culture in Colorado while also staying true to who I am as a leader.
Here are the approaches to self-management I put into practice during this time.
1.Forget about motivation. I don‚Äôt try to pump myself up. I love Tony Robbins, but I‚Äôve concluded that daily ice baths, trampolining, walking on hot coals, and reading mantras weren‚Äôt very grounding for me. When you‚Äôre in the struggle as an entrepreneur, motivation doesn‚Äôt ground.
Discipline, the practice of maintaining a commitment to habits, has nothing to do with motivation. Discipline is about focus and consistency. Take Serena Williams, do you think she has to motivate herself to practice every day? There‚Äôs no doubt she has bad days, but motivated or not, she always gets out on the court and performs. On the hard days, when the struggle is most real, it isn‚Äôt motivation that pushes you forward, it‚Äôs the discipline to do what you know needs to be done.
Instead of trying to pump yourself up, build your daily habits ‚Äî create a discipline around how you handle challenging situations and difficult people, stay on course with a clear and clean habit that allows you to be consistent, observe trends, and seek to rely less on how you‚Äôre feeling in the moment.
2. Use morning pages to unlock your mind when it‚Äôs fresh. I journal every day, almost at the same time each morning ‚Äî before I touch my phone or look at my email or social media, before my head is cluttered with my to-lists or attempts to tackle the day‚Äôs problems. I take about two minutes to jot down whatever comes to mind. Some days, what I write is profound, sometimes it‚Äôs supremely mundane, and other days it‚Äôs a prediction of the next plot twist on Billions. Sometimes it‚Äôs emotionally fraught, sometimes it‚Äôs thoughtful and creative. It doesn‚Äôt matter.
The point is to let the thoughts and emotions flow freely from my brain and onto a page, so I can move on with the rest of my day with a clear head.
3.Make time to reflect. At the end of each day, I make a personal mini podcast ‚Äî a short 4‚Äì5 minute recording where I reflect on what I did that day, who I spoke to, what worked or didn‚Äôt work, how I felt, interesting conversations, an action item that continues to not get done, etc. But I don‚Äôt just record and forget; I listen to the collection of my recordings on Sundays, and they help shape what I do going forward. I also listen every 4‚Äì6 months to assess what has changed and what might need to change.
They‚Äôre an opportunity to learn something without becoming overly emotional. It‚Äôs been most refreshing to look back on a challenge that seemed insurmountable two months ago that was resolved on its own or with my exec team, etc. I‚Äôm also reminded that if I‚Äôm working on the same issue four to six months later, it‚Äôs time to do something radically different.
4. Consume the wisdom of others ‚Äî read, read, read. I have a confession to make: I have a pretty serious reading habit. We‚Äôre talking at least a book a week as part of my constant quest for learning. There are even some books that I return to multiple times including:
As leaders ‚Äî CEOs, executives, founders, managers ‚Äî we are always facing the uncertainty of the unknown. We‚Äôre also dealing with our humanity and must learn how to stay out of the realm of unproductive emotions. That means staying mindful, self-managing, and learning how to turn challenges into lessons versus scars.
Despite the initial challenges and culture shock, I‚Äôve learned so much more about myself and about what it means to run a company outside of my comfort zone.
Thanks to the discipline I‚Äôve built around self-management, I know that I could run a company anywhere because I have created a system for capturing, codifying, and reflecting on each lesson, and turning those lessons into tools that enable me to be a more effective leader.

Jessie Lewis|72|8|https://medium.com/@jessielewis/my-client-intake-process-or-how-to-manage-inquiries-without-looking-like-a-terrified-child-bee50f1df712?source=tag_archive---------7---------------------|My Client Intake Process (Or, How to Manage Inquiries without Looking Like a Terrified Child)|"Oh no.
Someone actually said they‚Äôre interested in working with me.
I‚Äôm definitely not prepared for this.
Those first client feels. That moment when everything you‚Äôve worked for starts to pay off ‚Äî and you‚Äôre caught 100% off guard because holy crap, no one said people would ACTUALLY want to work with you!
That first inquiry is a defining moment for many freelancers, and actually a big reason why people don‚Äôt get started in the first place. What do you say to them? How do you get paid? It‚Äôs a big, hazy barrier that‚Äôs keeping you from your sparkly hopes and dreams of running a business.
Personally, figuring out how to handle my first clients was a jumbled mess, but since then I‚Äôve figured out a clear process for giving accurate quotes, setting good expectations, and closing the deal.
Turning inquiries into successful projects is not hard, but it does require a thoughtful process. Below is mine. Enjoy the wisdom that I slaved over through desperate Google searches, some heavy journaling, and talking with other freelancers.
Before I even consider them as a client, I seek learn everything I can about what they‚Äôre looking for. As a copywriter, this means: do they want full website copy, or just brand messaging? Do they need help on just a sales page, or do they need help planning a bigger campaign with email copy as well?
Generally, a client will provide at least a basic idea of this in their email when they reach out. You may even want to modify your contact/interest form to include some questions so you can get the big ones out of the way. You could include questions about their timeline, budget, and what they‚Äôre looking for.
Note that you‚Äôre probably going to get some bad leads when you first start out: Clients who don‚Äôt want to pay what your worth, who want you to do projects outside your specialty, or have no idea what they want. Sometimes, you‚Äôll take those bad leads because you need that income and you need to start building a portfolio. As someone just starting out, this is okay. But if you‚Äôre 8 months in and life is crap, it‚Äôs time to niche down and reevaluate what you‚Äôre charging.
Once you‚Äôve qualified that they‚Äôre a promising client, email back to schedule a call. Explain that you‚Äôd love to learn more about their project and talk over some of the details.
Then, before that call happens...
Before you get on the call, spend some time with the numbers. You want to be 100% prepared for the pricing conversation.
If you have no idea how you should be pricing your services, check out my introductory guide on how to price your services as a freelancer.
Basically, you‚Äôll want to estimate the number of hours each portion of the potential project will take you, and then calculate a baseline price by multiplying those hours by your hourly rate. Using this baseline, think about the minimum and maximum you might charge for each element.
Next, remember that what they want isn‚Äôt always something you can just jump in and do. For example, if you‚Äôre a designer and they want a full website redesign, you‚Äôre probably going to want to add in a paid discovery session to dive into who they are as a company, their brand voice, and what they really need to communicate. You might also ask around your local freelancing community to see if there‚Äôs a copywriter you might work with to write high-quality copy and really get their messaging down pat (cough cough, someone like me).
The idea here is to map out different options that you can discuss with the client, and when they ask how much it might cost, you can give a clear range. That way, you‚Äôll be able to state your prices with confidence: ‚ÄúIf you want , it‚Äôll be between $ and $, but I really recommend , and let me tell you why.‚Äù
You‚Äôve got your pricing estimated. You have a decent idea of what they‚Äôre looking for. Take a deep breath.
A quick tip here: Sometimes if I‚Äôm feeling uncertain about a call, I‚Äôll go change into more business-y clothing. A blazer truly works wonders for reminding yourself that you‚Äôre the professional... especially if you work from home and like to work in your PJ‚Äôs all day (What? Who, me? Never!). I‚Äôve also found it helps to stand up, or at least sit up straight. Good posture will make you sound more confident over the phone.
Okay, now you have three goals for this call:
1) Get the full parameters of what they‚Äôre looking for. Take really good notes!
2) give them your ballpark estimate based on what they‚Äôre looking for. Aren‚Äôt you glad you prepared?
3) Communicate to build trust. This topic could be its own article, but here are a few tangible ways you can use your words to start building a connection with the client:
If they aren‚Äôt sure what they‚Äôre looking for, you have a few options.
First, you could just politely and empathetically say that you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a good fit, and let them go. Follow your gut on this one.
Second, you could try billing hourly or suggest a retainer. This is ideal when they have a lot of ongoing work on different projects.
Finally, you could suggest a paid strategy session focused solely on outlining the steps that are going to get them from point A to point B. This is generally the preferred method when they have a clear goal in mind. You help them get their project in order (and learn a ton of helpful information about their business in the process), and then you have a clear outline of work to deliver.
But assuming you give your ballpark estimate and they‚Äôre excited to move forward, end the call by letting them know you‚Äôll follow up with a proposal within the next 24 hours.
You‚Äôve got work to do, baby.
Taking into account everything they‚Äôre looking for, write up a proposal, which is basically an outline of what the project is and how you plan to complete the work. Many freelancers and service providers (myself included) put this immediately into contract form. You can get a pretty solid contract to modify and use from And Co and Freelancers Union here. Read it carefully and change what you need to to fit your working style.
Ideally, you‚Äôll want to eventually create a contract that‚Äôs reviewed by a lawyer. However, most freelancers wing it early in their career. I‚Äôll also take this moment to cover my butt and remind you that I am not a lawyer, and I‚Äôm just here sharing my own experience, so none of this is legal advice and you should really talk to a professional.
Cool, let‚Äôs move on.
In the proposal/contract, you‚Äôll include information like the project timeline, payment amounts and due dates, privacy clauses, and who owns the work when it‚Äôs complete (usually the client owns it, but you‚Äôll want to retain the ability to share it in your portfolio).
Once you‚Äôre finished, send it to the client in an email. I usually ask them to look it over, and I make it clear that I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions they have. I also tell them I look forward to hearing from them, and I‚Äôll follow up within a certain time period. That way, if I don‚Äôt hear from them, I can follow up without sounding like a desperate lunatic ‚Äî they had a clear timeline.
At this point, they might ask for some changes to the project proposal, which I may make, or else I‚Äôll explain why it‚Äôs important to include. The changes I make are usually small details or timeline adjustments, not pricing changes. It‚Äôs important to honor your own prices, and this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem if you gave them an accurate ballpark number on your call.
If the client is pushing for a lower price and you still want to keep them, you can lower the price, but make clear that the project scope will have to be reduced with it. Your prices aren‚Äôt some arbitrary number ‚Äî they‚Äôre appropriate to your skill level and the value of the project you‚Äôre delivering.
Once they say they‚Äôre on board, send them a signed copy of the contract (you have to sign it too, remember!) and an invoice. Most freelancers I know ask for 50% up front and 50% at completion, so you‚Äôll invoice for that first 50%. Remember that this information should already be in your contract, so none of it will come as a surprise to your client.
There are a lot of tools out there that make this signing process easier. At the base level, you can make do with a printer and scanner for signing and accepting payment through PayPal. The next step up would be signing documents with Adobe Acrobat. Then, there are tools like Docusign that make it easy for your clients to sign online. Some accounting software allow you to send documents for signing, and even send invoices that can be paid online.
Once they sign your contract and pay that first deposit, you‚Äôre in business! You can begin the work, schedule your first meeting together, begin researching ‚Äî whatever you stated was the first step in your project, you‚Äôre free to begin it. And, of course, deliver on time and maintain good communication throughout.
If you are clear about how you work, they‚Äôll accept it as normal. And honestly, breaking THIS process should be a red flag. The process above is pretty standard, and if they‚Äôre asking for exceptions, be wary. Never do work outside of contract, and trust yourself when you know you‚Äôre going to need that strategy session or extra meeting to do good work. You‚Äôre the professional. Present yourself like one.
Heeeeeck no. While this is a good framework, you can do a lot to modify it to meet your needs. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be changing it for myself over time. The beautiful thing about running your own business is you get to set the rules and create the systems. Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment with how you manage payments, what you put in your contract (perhaps with a lawyer‚Äôs input), and what information you have on your website!

Hardy|98K|21|https://medium.com/thrive-global/want-to-become-a-multi-millionaire-do-these-15-things-immediately-e1e779a6978f?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|Want To Become A Multi-Millionaire? Do These 15 Things Immediately.|"Most people wish their circumstances would magically change for them. They don‚Äôt have the desire to become better themselves so they can proactively improve their own circumstances.
Unlike most people, who simply wait and wish for luck, you can seek to become the kind of person equipped with the skills and abilities to do brilliant things.
You can become the kind of person who does highly influential work. Your work can solve pressing problems, improve people‚Äôs lives, and get noticed by important people who share your work not for your sake, but for theirs! Sharing your work makes them look good because of how great it is.
The quality of who you are as a person, and the work you do, is completely within your control. But you can‚Äôt wish for it to happen. You must become the kind of person who naturally attracts the success you seek.
Here‚Äôs how:
If you don‚Äôt pay for something, you rarely pay attention.
Most people want stuff that‚Äôs free. But if you get something for free, you rarely prize that thing. You rarely take it seriously.
How much do you invest in yourself?
How committed are you to yourself?
If you aren‚Äôt investing in yourself, than you don‚Äôt have any skin in the game of your own life.
If you aren‚Äôt invested in your business, you probably won‚Äôt do high quality work.
If you‚Äôre not invested in your relationships, you‚Äôre probably more focused on what you can get than what you can give.
When it comes to self-improvement, investing 10% of your income on yourself will yield a 100X or more return on that investment. For every dollar you spend on your education, skills, and relationships, you‚Äôll get at least 100 dollars back in returns.
If you want to do something extremely well, you need to surround yourself with the right mentors. Anything that you‚Äôll ever do well will be the result of high quality mentoring. If you suck at something, it‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt received quality mentoring in that thing.
The best mentorships are the ones where you pay your mentor. Often, the more you pay the better, because you‚Äôll take the relationship far more seriously. You won‚Äôt solely be taking in that relationship. You won‚Äôt purely be a consumer. Instead, you‚Äôll be invested, and as such, you‚Äôll listen more carefully. You‚Äôll care more. You‚Äôll be more thoughtful and engaged. There will be higher consequences for not succeeding.
I invested $3,000 to get help writing my first book proposal from a highly successful writer. That $3,000 got me maybe 4 or 5 hours of his time. But in those 4 or 5 hours, he taught me what I needed to know to create an amazing book proposal. He provided me resources that dramatically enhanced and sped up my process. With his help, I was able to get a literary agent and eventually a multi six figure book contract.
Had I been overly concerned about the $3,000, I‚Äôm confident that to this day, I‚Äôd still not have written a book proposal. At the very most, I‚Äôd have written a terrible one. I would not have been as motivated or invested, so I would have been far more likely to procrastinate needed action.
If you don‚Äôt have much money, surely you can afford to buy a book. How much money and time do you spend on entertainment, clothes, or food? It‚Äôs a matter of priority.
It‚Äôs only when you invest in something that you have the motivation to make it happen.
Beyond mentorships, you should invest in education programs such as online courses, books, quality products such as food and sleep.
Your level of success can generally be directly measured by your level of investment. If you‚Äôre not getting the results you want, it‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt invested enough to get those results.
Your number 1 investment must be yourself.
Who you are determines:
Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find when you financially invest yourself in something. You become very committed to that thing. Economists call this sunk cost bias. But you can leverage this to your benefit. If you want to escalate your personal commitment to something, invest heavily in that thing.
Eventually, it will become a point of no return.
You‚Äôll become so fiercely committed that withdrawing will seem ridiculous.
Hence, you‚Äôll need to truly know WHAT you want and WHY (see #14 below). If you don‚Äôt know these things, then over-committing could be a huge and irrational problem.
However, if you are certain about WHO you are/want to be, WHAT you want, and WHY, then you need to invest yourself.
Most people are consumers rather than creators.
They are at work to get their paycheck, not to make a difference.
When left to their own devices, most people consume their time as well. It is only by investing your time that you get a return on that time.
Nearly every second spent on social media is consumed time. You can‚Äôt have that time back. Rather than making your future better, it actually made your future worse. Just like eating bad food, every consumed moment leaves you worse off. Every invested moment leaves you better off.
Entertainment is all well and good. But only when that entertainment is an investment in your relationships or yourself. You‚Äôll know if it was an investment if that entertainment continues to yield returns over and over in your future. That may include positive memories, transformational learning, or deepened relationships.
Even still, life isn‚Äôt purely about being entertained. Education and learning is also key. And although both are essential, education will provide far greater returns in your future.
The world‚Äôs most successful people are intense learners. They are hard readers. They know that what they know determines how well they see the world. They know that what they know determines the quality of relationships they can have and the quality of work they can do.
If you are constantly consuming junk media, how can you possibly expect to create high value work? Your input directly translates to your output. Garbage in, garbage out.
Just as a large majority of your down-time should be spent learning, so should a great deal of your ‚Äúworking‚Äù time.
Wealthy and happy people work to learn. Unsuccessful and unhappy people work primarily for money.
Only 20% of your energy should be spent doing your actual work. The rest should be spent learning, improving yourself, and resting.
It is by ‚Äúsharpening your saw‚Äù that you‚Äôll continue to become a better and more capable person. Thus, as you dedicate large portions of time becoming a better thinker, communicator, and better at your craft, the quality of your work will continue to increase. Eventually, you‚Äôll be able to charge VERY VERY high fees for your work, because no one else can do it like you.
When you prioritize learning and recovery, then during the hours you are actually working, you‚Äôll be in a deep flow state. You won‚Äôt be distracted like most people are when they work. You‚Äôre either 100% on or 100% off. While working, you can get more done in a few hours than most people get done in a number of days.
Your time is spent well because your priorities are clear, you‚Äôre well-rested, and your mind is stimulated.
In our media and information age, there are a million things you could learn. But if you don‚Äôt put that learning into immediate practice, it becomes shallow information.
Information and knowledge are two very different things.
Knowledge and wisdom are also two very different things.
It takes wisdom to determine what you should learn, why you should learn it, and when you should learn it.
Unless you‚Äôre invested, you probably won‚Äôt learn with the intensity needed to maximize that knowledge.
Unless you understand the value of your time, you probably won‚Äôt have the discernment to ignore almost everything while learning that which will bring the highest return.
When you learn something, you should get a return on that learning. Far too many people read books now just to say they‚Äôve read lots of books. If you‚Äôre not applying what you‚Äôre learning, your consuming and wasting your time.
Very few people create true wealth.
Even those who have high incomes are not truly wealthy. Most people‚Äôs lifestyles match their incomes. When they make more, they consume more. In fact, most people make money solely to consume.
Very few people make money to invest that money.
It‚Äôs best to think of your business as only 1/2 of your income equation. You have your business which brings income. Then, you have your investment entity to turn your income into even more money.
Like anything, how well you manage your money is determined by how well mentored you are. If you want to become brilliant with money, invest in education and mentoring.
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The best time to start investing was also in the past. If you haven‚Äôt started yet, don‚Äôt sit and wallow in regret. Tomorrow doesn‚Äôt exist for people who don‚Äôt do something today.
Start today. Get yourself educated. Create a vehicle, or several vehicles, where you put at least 10% of your income. Eventually, your investment vehicle may even start producing more profits for you than your actual business.
Compound interest is a real thing. If you put 10% of your income into your investments over a long enough period of time, you‚Äôll be set. Unlike the majority of high earners out there, you‚Äôll be able to STOP WORKING whenever you want, because your money is making more than enough money for you to comfortably live with.
Most people are only focused on what they can get out of life.
Me, me, me.
However, once you become more consciously awake to the world, your desire will shift from merely receiving to giving.
You‚Äôll realize that it‚Äôs actually far more satisfying to give than to get.Moreover, you‚Äôll be driven by a cause you fully believe in.
The truth is, you really only have 1 of 2 orientations towards people (and life).
Either you are in relationships as TRANSACTIONS, or as TRANSFORMATIONS.
Most people have transactional relationships. They‚Äôre focused only on what they get out of the relationship. It‚Äôs all about furthering their own agenda. It‚Äôs rooted in scarcity. It‚Äôs selfish.
This isn‚Äôt how you get far in relationships and life.
It‚Äôs also how you get stuck in your own small-mindedness.
Transformational relationships, on the other hand, are completely focused on giving and gratitude ‚Äî the hallmarks of abundance. In these relationships, the whole becomes more than the sum of parts. Both parties, in vulnerability and trust, transcend their own small-mindedness and become something more.
At the core, this requires being a giver, not a taker. As Adam Grant has explained in his book, Give and Take, when two givers come together, the results are astronomical.
Here‚Äôs a pro-tip: don‚Äôt surround yourself with takers.
When your motivation is to give, you‚Äôll often get insights about how you can improve your relationships. Random thoughts will pop into you head to send ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù texts to various people.
You‚Äôll have more ideas about how you can improve other people‚Äôs lives and businesses.
You‚Äôll start contributing more, which will lead to far more opportunities and deeper relationships. People will come to love and trust you. Your work will be motivated by a higher cause and thus will be far more inspired and impactful.
Just because your primary motivation is to give, doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt also seek a lot of help.
Actually, you are constantly seeking and receiving help.
The truth is, everyone is highly dependent on other people to do what they do. But it takes wisdom and humility to openly acknowledge that dependence. Rather than seeing it as a weakness, realize that it‚Äôs a strength.
Beyond acknowledging your dependence, constantly express your appreciation to the people in your life. That which you appreciate, appreciates. Relationships are assets that can and should grow bigger and better over time. As the brilliant entrepreneur Michael Fishman has said, ‚ÄúSelf-made is an illusion. There are many people who played divine roles in you having the life that you have today. Be sure to let them know how grateful you are.‚Äù
If you don‚Äôt appreciate and give to your relationships, your relationships will suffer. All relationships are like bank accounts, and if one person is constantly depositing and the other person is constantly withdrawing, eventually all of the resources become depleted.
In such relationships, 1+1=less than 2.
Conversely, in synergistic and healthy relationships, 1+1= far more than 2. When two people are continually giving and receiving, the relational bank account continues to grow and expand, providing several intended and unintended benefits.
For example, I was recently at the gym with my brother. At the beginning of the workout, he was struggling mentally. He wasn‚Äôt adding to my energy and helping my workout become better than if I was alone, but instead, he was sucking my energy and requiring me to exert more energy and effort than if I was alone.
I made him aware of what was happening, and he immediately shifted his emotional posture. He realized how dramatically his mood was impacting me. His motivation shifted from consuming an experience to creating something great.
Our shared mental state heightened, taking us into group flow. Our workout become far superior to anything I could create on my own. Not only that, but we began to engage in inspired conversation. This led to brilliant insights and connections that were relevant to the book I‚Äôm writing.
The amazing workout was the intended outcome of our synergy. The insights for my book were unintended benefits. This can only happen when both parties are actively giving and receiving from the relationship. Where both are focusing on creating rather than consuming. Where both have the primary motivation of helping the other person succeed.
Most people are in a state of competition rather than collaboration.
Collaboration is a much higher level than competition.
Competition is focused on the self. It‚Äôs also very low level thinking, because what you can do on your own is very limited.
People who are competing are grinding. They‚Äôre more focused on winning than creating real solutions.
However, when your thinking becomes expanded, you realize you could do so much more with other people. Collaboration creates unique connections working by yourself never could.
You have skills and knowledge that are awesome in your field. There are other people in different fields who have skills and knowledge completely outside of your current awareness. These people also have assets you don‚Äôt have.
If you want to get 10X or 100X the results of other people in your field, you need to develop strategic ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù partnerships. This generally happens when you devise a plan where your skill sets and assets merge with the skill sets and assets of someone else.
What you can do well, someone else may struggle with. What you struggle with, others can do extremely well.
Who can you partner with that could speed your process?
Who has assets and resources you don‚Äôt?
How could you help these people?
What types of partnerships could you develop, that would allow you to more quickly achieve your goals and help them more quickly achieve theirs?
When you collaborate with other people, 1+1=more than 2. The whole becomes DIFFERENT from the sum of it‚Äôs parts.
This is how TRANSFORMATION occurs. Only those who engage in collaboration actually experience true transformation. People who only work well by themselves are stuck in their own narrow worldview and agendas.
When you merge with others, your ideas and goals change. They become bigger and better. They become DIFFERENT from what you could ever create on your own.
The only way to have these types of partnerships is to think long-term. You must be invested and have skin in the game. It can‚Äôt be transactional. It‚Äôs can‚Äôt be this for that. It must be about something a lot deeper. When it is, you‚Äôll have far more integrity in the work you do. You‚Äôll express greater appreciation. You‚Äôll consistently do the right thing, even if that right thing is difficult and uncomfortable.
Don‚Äôt seek transactional relationships. Only seek long-term TRANSFORMATIONAL relationships.
Look at your current goals.
Why is that your metric for ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù?
Why is that your target?
What would happen if, in all seriousness, you 10X‚Äôd that target?
What if rather than earning $3,000/month, you pursued $30,000/month?
Is that even possible?
Of course it‚Äôs possible. There‚Äôs several people doing it.
The only difference between them and you is their education, relationships, and strategy.
When you set a 10X goal, you‚Äôre required to think very differently about your daily behaviors. You‚Äôre required to be more serious in all aspects of your life. You‚Äôre required to eliminate limiting thinking and consumptive distractions.
Setting a 10X goal will be one of the best things you‚Äôve ever done for yourself. This goal should be created while you are in a peak state. You get into a peak state by doing something powerful, whether that be exercising, learning, or being in a unique environment, such as a foreign country. You can even get into a peak state by being around certain types of people, the ones who inspire you to be the best version of yourself.
Only you know what gets you into a peak and passionate state. So, do whatever it is that gets you there, and then write down your goals. Declare what you‚Äôre going to do. Then write that goal down and visualize it‚Äôs achievement every single day until it becomes your reality.
When you think about this goal, don‚Äôt deviate from the natural flow of ideas that follow.
You can‚Äôt 10X your results by engaging in the same thinking and behaviors you‚Äôre currently performing. Consequently, while thinking about your goal, you‚Äôll also get ideas about what you need to do, realistically, to achieve that goal.
Chances are, you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know. So you‚Äôll need to start really educating yourself about how you could conceivably achieve your goal.You‚Äôll need to get bolder about the work you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôll need to create more, and fail more. Over and over, in fact. Quantity is often the fastest path to quality.
Not only that, but when you think about your 10X goal, you‚Äôll probably have ideas that scare you. When you do work that scares you, you cross a boundary that most people never cross. Scary work is often highly profitable and valuable work.
Marketing is nothing more than applied psychology.
It‚Äôs about connecting with people, persuading them, and helping them.
Many people think marketing is a nasty or immoral thing.
Many ‚Äúartists‚Äù don‚Äôt learn marketing because they don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúsell out.‚Äù They want their work to be pure.
Academics are not better. Their work is not accessible to the common man.
Marketing is nothing more than making your work easier and better to find and use.
People aren‚Äôt magically going to appear and buy your stuff.
People aren‚Äôt going to magically appear and read your stuff.
Even right now: How did you land on this page? Look at the title of this article. I could have just as easily called it, ‚ÄúAdvice for becoming successful.‚Äù
But would you have clicked on that article?
Probably not.
But you clicked on this one.
Why did you click on this one?
How did you get this far down?
Think about the experience.
Marketing is the ‚ÄúHOW‚Äù to whatever it is you do.
The reason most people aren‚Äôt successful is because they either fear or avoid marketing. For the same reason, most people are bad teachers. They‚Äôre more focused on content than the delivery and design of that content.
But the delivery ‚Äî the HOW ‚Äî is just as important IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT than WHAT you‚Äôre doing or WHY you‚Äôre doing it.
You could have the cure for cancer. But if you don‚Äôt market it well, you‚Äôll never get your cure out there.
You could have the world‚Äôs most important message, or greatest story, but no one will see it if you don‚Äôt promote and package it intelligently.
Founder of the exclusive entrepreneurial coaching platform, Strategic Coach, Dan Sullivan distinguishes between those who are in the ‚ÄúTime-and-Effort Economy‚Äù with those who are in the ‚ÄúResults Economy.‚Äù
If you‚Äôre in the time and effort economy, you are focused on being busy. You actually believe the amount of time and energy you put into something merits praise. Conversely, when you are in the results economy, you are only focused on achieving a specific result.
The bottom line is what matters, and thus, it becomes very important to find the most effective way to get there. This is a key difference between entrepreneurs and employees. As Sullivan says:
Most people don‚Äôt think in terms of results because their security is in a paycheck. However, when you shift your focus from how little you can do to how much you can do, you change how you work.
You start learning ways to accomplish more faster. You take on greater responsibility. You change your environment. And you also realize just how important sleep and rest are to achieving the highest possible results. Hence, you begin to take more and more time off and rest.
When you dedicate 80 percent of your energy to rest and self-improvement, then you have a lot of fodder and a very sharp saw to use during the time you‚Äôre actually working.
You‚Äôre thinking 10X bigger than everyone else. You‚Äôre operating under short timelines and high pressure. You can tax yourself to extremes while you work because you spend lots and lots of time resting and preparing.
The environments you work in should reflect the work you‚Äôre doing.
Doing several types of work in the same environment is ineffective. But people do it all the time. They sit in the same seat and mentally shift from one task to another.
A far better approach is to BATCH your activities and to do those activities in a relevant environment.
For example, when I write a blog post, I work in a quiet library where I have no distractions. Because my environment facilitates quality writing, and because I knew I‚Äôd be writing that day, I write a lot. It‚Äôs easier to write 2‚Äì5 blog posts in one sitting than to try writing one post at a time.
Ari Meisel, author and entrepreneur, batches his activities and alternates his environments to match the work he‚Äôs doing. On days he is recording podcasts, he goes to a studio and records about 5 podcast episodes in a single session.
On other days, he spends his whole day in meetings or on calls. He does this work at his friend‚Äôs apartment because it‚Äôs a much more engaging environment.
He also does a lot of writing, and does that at the SOHO HOUSE in New York City, because it‚Äôs a quiet environment with poor internet connection. The lack of connection stops him from surfing the web and even using his phone, because he has bad reception.
Success and wealth are not all about money.
There are a lot of people who have money and have little ‚Äúcapital‚Äù in the other key areas of their lives.
Money, obviously, is very important. It solves a lot of problems. It‚Äôs speeds processes.
But money is a tool. It‚Äôs a means to an end. For those engaging in work they truly believe in, money is simply a tool for doing more work.
What is your WHY for what you‚Äôre doing or pursuing?
How could you possibly know your why?
More importantly, how could you know your REAL WHY?
It‚Äôs actually quite simple.
But it takes some radical honestly.
There‚Äôs an exercise I‚Äôll walk you through to get to your WHY. And more importantly, once you know your deepest WHY for what you‚Äôre doing, you should operate FROM THAT STATE, not from your lower and base-level reasons.
When trying to understand why you do something, it‚Äôs better to ask ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù questions then ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù questions, because ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù questions tend to put people on the defensive.
Here‚Äôs a solid question you could ask yourself to understand your WHY.
What about ______________ is important to you?
Let‚Äôs say you want to start a business, or get a new cellphone, or go to the gym...
It could be big or small.
But put that thing in there.
What about ‚Äúgoing to the gym‚Äù is important to you?
Then, you just write the first thing that comes to your mind: because I like feeling good.
Then you take your answer, and put it in the same question: What about ______________ is important to you?
So, given the previous answer: What about ‚Äúfeeling good‚Äù is important to you?
A simple way to structure this exercise is shown in the images just below.
So, you want to try to go 7-layers deep. Once you get to layers 5, 6, and 7, you‚Äôre going to have to be really honest with yourself.
Usually, you can answer layers 1‚Äì4 with your head. However, if you‚Äôre being really honest with yourself, and I mean REALLY HONEST, you‚Äôll need to come from your heart to answer layers 5‚Äì7.
It‚Äôs at the deepest levels that you‚Äôll discover your TRUE WHY for what you‚Äôre doing. Even if that something is as simple as getting a new cellphone or going to the gym.
But you want to remind yourself of your DEEPEST WHY when you‚Äôre doing something. And you want to operate from THAT LEVEL, because at your deepest level, you‚Äôll be operating from your heart, not your head. Thus, your performance will be much deeper, more authentic, and powerful.
The stakes will be higher.
Suddenly, you‚Äôre not just going to the gym to ‚Äúfeel good,‚Äù but because you have a higher calling to perform and need to be as healthy as possible to make it happen (or whatever your deepest WHY is).
Your DEEPEST why will almost always expose something very personal about you, and about your fundamental beliefs about life.
You want to be aware of these things, and how/why they drive you to do what you‚Äôre doing.
If you truly go through this exercise in a genuine way, you should get some mental and emotional breakthroughs.
You should discover something about yourself, and why you are the way you are, and why you‚Äôre pursuing the specific things you are.
Know your why.
Then act from the DEEPEST and most powerful WHY you have.
You‚Äôll be far more brilliant at what you do.
In order to be successful, you must believe in something.
You must have a stand.
All successful people and brands have a clear WHY. As Simon Sinek explains in his book, Start With Why, people don‚Äôt buy what you sell, they buy why you sell it.
Apple is a great example. In all of their marketing, they don‚Äôt explain the technicalities of their products, they define and share their core values. They believe technology should be both easy to use and cool.
If you want to be compelling and interesting, you must truly believe in something. You must have a clear stand. That stand becomes your brand. It becomes your trademark. It becomes how you distinguish yourself from others.
When you have a clear stand and brand, you stand out. You are no longer neutral. You believe in something, and are fighting to make a specific change.
As a result, people will either love you or hate you. That‚Äôs what you want. Lukewarm means you have nothing to say. Lukewarm means you‚Äôre trying to appeal to everyone.
The riches are in the niches. Your niche is your audience. They are a small group of people who agree with the stand you‚Äôre trying to make. They are your evangelists.
If you try to appeal to everyone, your message, marketing, and products will be terrible. You won‚Äôt be clear on your why, and neither will anyone else. Thus, you‚Äôll be average like everyone else and your work won‚Äôt stand out.
Only people with firm stands get really really good at marketing. They care enough about their message to get it out there. They realize that the HOW is just as important as the WHAT and WHY.
Are you doing these 15 things?
How aggressively are you doing them?
Do you want to become a multi-millionaire?
Are you ready to think and act bigger?
You‚Äôve got this.
I‚Äôve created a cheat sheet for putting yourself into a PEAK-STATE, immediately. You follow this daily, your life will change very quickly.
Get the cheat sheet here!

Awoken from a nice long afternoon nap, the old crocodile glanced at the young crocodile with one of his reptilian eyes, said nothing and then fell back asleep atop the water.
Feeling frustrated and disrespected, the young crocodile swam off upriver to chase after some catfish, leaving behind a flurry of bubbles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show him‚Äù, he thought to himself.
Later that day the young crocodile returned to the old crocodile who was still napping and began to brag to him about his successful hunt,
Unphased the old crocodile again looked at the young crocodile, said nothing, closed his eyes and continued to float atop the water as tiny minnows muched away lightly at the algae on his underbelly.
Again, the young crocodile was angry he couldn‚Äôt get a response from the elder, and he swam off a second time upstream to see what he could hunt.
After a few hours of thrashing about he was able to hunt down a small crane. Smiling, he kept the bird in his jaws and swam back to the old crocodile, adamant about showing him who the true hunter was.
As the young crocodile rounded the bend, he saw the elder crocodile still floating in the same spot near the river‚Äôs edge.
However, something had changed ‚Äî a large wildebeest was enjoying an afternoon drink just inches near the old crocodile‚Äôs head.
In one lightning fast movement, the old crocodile bolted out of the water, wrapped his jaws around the great wildebeest and pulled him under the river.
Awestruck the young crocodile swam up with the tiny bird hanging from his mouth and watched as the old crocodile enjoyed his 500 lb meal.
The young crocodile asked him, ‚ÄúPlease... tell me... how... how did you do that?‚Äù
Through mouthfuls of wildebeest, the old crocodile finally responded,
When I was first building JotForm, I was a lot like the young crocodile ‚Äî believing that I always had to be doing something to get results.
Back then, if someone would have told me that I would see greater results by spending more time doing nothing, I would have rolled my eyes and continued to chip away at my 16 hour day of work.
I thought that in order to be successful, I had to constantly be building, working, growing and developing the next thing ‚Äî whatever that ‚Äúthing‚Äù was.
All of us have a problem with busyness. But being busy and being successful are not one in the same. And, I think if we were to make ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù more of a priority, we might find ourselves catching more wildebeests versus measly catfish.
It worked for me, and I hope it can work for you, too.
But, doing less or nothing at all is easier said than done, especially in a society that suffers from extreme busyness. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at our unhealthy obsession with staying busy...
Mankind has struggled with busyness since the beginning of time ‚Äî or at least since 425 BC when Homer walked the Earth.
The Odyssey tells the tale of the Lotus-eaters ‚Äî a strange people that slothed around all day long eating lotus and doing nothing. And, what was stranger than fiction was that these people were content with their lives.
Homer wrote that after some of Odysseus‚Äôs crew ate the Lotus-eaters Lotus fruit (say that three times fast), they became like the Lotus-eaters ‚Äî content, relaxed and a bit lethargic.
Terrified that if all of his men ate the lotus fruit they would be unmotivated to return home, Odysseus ordered the affected men to be tied to the ship benches and for the ship to set sail immediately.
It ‚Äôs interesting, Odysseus‚Äôs reaction to this feeling of ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù sounds similar to the Corporate CEO, the Startup Founder and the collegiate football coach we know today ‚Äî hardcore workaholics that despise anything that might allude to a sense of complacency.
Though, they of course are just the tip of a much larger societal iceberg that feels frozen with fear at the thought of doing nothing.
The world as a whole now measures value in terms of busyness versus quality of work. In many ways, it has become something of a status symbol to be ‚Äúbusy‚Äù.
How many times have you heard or had a conversation like this...
We‚Äôve grown to subconsciously measure a person‚Äôs worth based off how many hours they work, how much is on their plate and put simply ‚Äî whether or not they are running around like a chicken with their head cut off.
In Tim Ferriss‚Äôs 4-Hour Work Week, he pokes fun at this idea by facetiously saying that if you want a promotion, you should appear to be more busy by working longer hours, scrambling around and constantly answering emails.
But, sooner or later, all of us have to ask ourselves what our mission is ‚Äî is it to be the busiest or is it to make the most impact?
And, what‚Äôs fascinating is that when we look at some of the greatest minds to grace planet Earth, we see an interesting commonality ‚Äî they all make time for doing nothing.
Making time in your life to do nothing can be challenging ‚Äî especially during the work week where we are constantly pummeled and bombarded with meetings, notifications and an ever growing list of tasks.
Busy founders have started implementing ‚ÄúThink Weeks‚Äù into their annual schedules ‚Äî week long periods they spend reflecting, reading, thinking and living outside the all-encapsulating world that is running a business.
While young founders like Skillshare‚Äôs Mike Karnjanaprakorn have adopted this practice, as well as big names like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Ferriss, it was Bill Gates who originally made the Think Week famous.
For many years while running Microsoft, Gates would retreat into week long Think Weeks twice a year ‚Äî not vacations, but actual periods of time dedicated to doing nothing.
Gates was so adamant about his Think Weeks that family, friends and Microsoft employees were banned. Today, Gates attributes much of Microsoft‚Äôs success to the big ideas and concepts he stumbled upon while doing nothing.
You don‚Äôt necessarily have to ban family and friends to retreat into a Think Week, though. Take me as an example.
Every year, I take at least a full week off from my company and head back to my hometown to help my parents with the olive harvest.
All thoughts of startup growth or conversion rates slip away when you‚Äôre picking olives. It‚Äôs meditative and calming.
I know that olive picking won‚Äôt land me at the top of TechCrunch, but it‚Äôs a personal measure of success. And somehow, some of my best ideas come to me during this period.
For someone who can‚Äôt take an entire week off of work once a year to do nothing, I recommend taking a slightly different approach ‚Äî embracing the digital sabbath.
On either Saturday or Sunday, force yourself to step away from all forms of technology ‚Äî a practice known as a digital sabbath.
Shut off your smartphone and hide it in your closet. Powerdown the laptop and slide it under your bed. And, try with all your might to refrain from binge-watching Netflix.
Give your brain space to think by stepping away from the daily grind and doing nothing. Your mind will have time to stumble upon new ideas and further process old ones.
You may find the success that results from this practice to be similar to that of the old crocodile at the beginning of this article.
While we tell ourselves we can achieve more by scrambling, sometimes it‚Äôs better to close our eyes and just float.
And, wait, until the wildebeest shows up.

You will discover why you‚Äôve never heard of the latter here shortly.
As you probably read somewhere inside that history textbook you were forced to lug around through elementary ‚Äî The Wright Brothers were responsible for creating the first successful airplane. You remember how the story goes...
While today ‚ÄúThe Wright Brothers‚Äù is the first name that comes to anyone‚Äôs mind when they hear the word fly, once upon a time the pair were major underdogs.
In fact, during the race to the sky, most of America had its money on the man I mentioned earlier, Langley.
He was an extremely outspoken astronomer, physicist and aviation pioneer who was on a mission to make history. Langley‚Äôs high stature as the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution gave him both the credibility and hype he needed to get America on his side.
Not to mention, he was extremely well-backed by the War Department who contributed $50,000 to help him be the first to get a bird in the sky.
Long story short, despite all the hype, Langley‚Äôs flying machine ended up crashing and burning while The Wright Brother‚Äôs plane ended up soaring.
One party had the entire world, vast resources and plenty of moolah on his side, while the other just had a small bike shop and a passion to fly.
So, let me ask you this... can you guess why The Wright Brothers achieved their goal to take flight while Langley failed?
The Wright Brothers victory over Langley came down to passion, intrinsic motivation (Langley was very status driven) and perhaps praise.
While Langley was sharing his ambitions with the world and being heavily praised for feats he had not yet achieved, The Wright Brothers were receiving little to no attention whatsoever.
Some experts argue that early praise can leave the individual receiving the praise feeling like he or she has already won... in turn causing them to be less likely to follow through with their goals.
For example, in Peter Gollwitzer‚Äôs research article, When Intentions Go Public, he raises this very question:
Gollwitzer and his team of researchers carried out a handful of studies, here is a brief excerpt from their findings:
‚ÄúOther people‚Äôs taking notice of one‚Äôs identity-relevant intentions apparently engenders a premature sense of completeness regarding the identity goal.‚Äù
In English, what Gollwitzer found was that when individuals set a goal that is closely tied to their identity and then share their intentions with others, they are less likely to achieve the goal.
For example, if your goal is to start drinking more water and you tell your friends and family that you‚Äôre going to start drinking more water, this would probably have little to no impact on whether or not you actually drink more water.
Why? Because drinking more water isn‚Äôt something you hold close to your identity.
On the other hand, if your goal is to lose 40 lbs and drop 2‚Äì3 waist sizes, it might not be the best idea to post about it all over Facebook. Your appearance is something you very much so identify with. So, if you tell people you plan to lose weight and everyone tells you how awesome you are and how great you‚Äôre going to look, you might be less likely to lose the weight.
This finding is a bit counterintuitive, considering we were told by our teachers and coaches growing up to set our goals, share our goals, hold ourselves accountable.
But, the theory certainly holds some weight (pun very much intended), and is one that has been adopted by highly successful serial entrepreneurs like Derek Sivers, founder of CD Baby.
Sivers gave a TED Talk on this very topic nearly a decade back. To prove his point, he asked the audience to imagine how they felt when they shared their goals with others:
Sivers goes on to explain that it‚Äôs this ‚Äúwarm feeling‚Äù that keeps us from battling on to actually achieve our goals.
When we openly share our goals, we experience a feeling of success that normally only takes place upon completion of the goal.
The result? We don‚Äôt ever actually pursue the goal.
I‚Äôve recently shared 3 real-life business tactics to achieve your ‚Äúbig hairy goals‚Äù. But now, let‚Äôs talk about what can actually work when it comes to successfully reaching your goals.
For two counterintuitive yet effective approaches to this, we look to a philosophy called ‚Äúfear-setting‚Äù and making an effort to surround yourself with competition.
Entrepreneur, angel investor and writer, Tim Ferriss, gave an incredible TED Talk where he discussed how fear-setting is instrumental in achieving one‚Äôs goals.
He recommends that instead of obsessively sharing your goals, you should come to terms with all the fears that are preventing you from achieving them.
For example, let‚Äôs say your goal is to start your own business. Ferriss recommends that you write down all of your fears that are associated with starting a business.
These might include... ‚ÄúLosing all my money‚Äù... ‚ÄúGetting fired from my day job‚Äù... ‚ÄúGetting laughed at or judged if I fail‚Äù.
Once you write down these fears, you should then write down how you would go about preventing these fears (or mitigating the likelihood) of them actually happening.
For example, for the first fear ‚Äúlosing all my money‚Äù, your prevention might be... ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only going to invest $2,500 that way I can‚Äôt lose it all.‚Äù
Finally, after you have written down your preventions, you should then write down how you will repair what you fear from happening... if it actually ends up happening.
So, to repair losing the $2,500, you might write down, ‚ÄúGet a part time job as a bartender in addition to my day job until I make the $2,500 back.‚Äù
By concentrating on fear-setting over goal-sharing, it allows you to remove the fear that is keeping you from actually achieving your goals.
In addition to fear-setting, it might also be a good idea to surround yourself with competition.
A healthy dose of competition can be good for your business, too. At JotForm, we love to use competition to our advantage with events like hackweeks to achieve our product release goals.
A study published two years ago in the journal Preventive Medicine Reports, sheds some light on the impact that competition has on our goals.
The study put 800 undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania through an 11-week exercise program where each person was assigned to work out alone or in a team.
In addition, the teams were designed to be either supportive or competitive.
By the end of the study, researchers found that students involved in the competitive team programs were 90% more likely to attend their scheduled exercise sessions than any other group.
Not only is this number staggering, but it also proves that competition can create a higher level of commitment among people chasing down goals.
When you surround yourself with competition, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to share your goals with the competition. You don‚Äôt have to tell the other folks in the spin class, cross-fit training or pick-up basketball leagues that your goal is to lose 50 lbs.
But, by simply showing up and placing yourself in a competitive environment, you will be more likely to push harder and show up more often ‚Äî two factors that can help your reach your goals.
The science behind achieving goals has always been an interesting topic.
While some entrepreneurs advocate the idea that you should never have a goal, I‚Äôve recently explained why setting big goals can make you miserable.
Whether you decide to share your goals or not, what I‚Äôve found out across 12 years of entrepreneurship is that you should craft your own path.
What works for others won‚Äôt always work for you. And what works for you today won‚Äôt always work tomorrow.

Andy Raskin|20K|4|https://medium.com/the-mission/steve-jobs-secret-for-eliciting-questions-overheard-at-a-san-francisco-cafe-80b1af67433?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|Steve Jobs‚Äô Secret for Eliciting Questions, Overheard at a San Francisco Cafe|"Last month, I was enjoying the remarkably good crab cake and poached eggs at Just for You CafeÃÅ in San Francisco‚Äôs Dogpatch neighborhood, when I overheard a mentoring session taking place at the next table. I recognized the mentor as the famous, fifty-something ex-CEO of a household-brand Internet company; the mentee, I pieced together, was the twenty-something CEO of an app on my phone that had raised over $70 million in VC cash.
‚ÄúMy leadership team just gave me anonymous feedback,‚Äù Young CEO told Famous CEO. ‚ÄúOne thing they said was that I‚Äôm not open to being questioned.‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you?‚Äù Famous CEO asked.
‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Young CEO insisted. ‚ÄúAfter every conversation with my team and every all-hands, I always ask if there are any questions or concerns.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet me guess,‚Äù Famous CEO said. ‚ÄúNo one ever has any.‚Äù
‚ÄúRight,‚Äù the mentee reflected. ‚ÄúMaybe I should hold office hours where people can raise concerns privately?‚Äù
‚ÄúI used to do that,‚Äù Famous CEO said. ‚ÄúBut here‚Äôs what happens. People come in, they talk to you about some important issue, and you give your thoughts. Then they go back to their teams and say, ‚ÄòThe CEO said ___,‚Äô and they lord your words over colleagues as a weapon. So I stopped doing that.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo what should I do?‚Äù
By this point, the mentee wasn‚Äôt the only one interested in the answer. In my work with CEOs and executive teams around strategic narrative, I often have a similar need‚Äîas anyone does who leads groups‚Äîto quickly take the pulse in the room.
‚ÄúTake notes on this,‚Äù Famous CEO said. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm going to tell you what Steve Jobs did, which was related to me by the late [Apple board member] Bill Campbell.‚Äù
I ordered another crab cake.
‚ÄúIn the early 2000s,‚Äù Famous CEO said, ‚ÄúJobs was splitting his time between Apple and Pixar. He would spend most days at Apple, but then he would parachute into Pixar. He would have to figure out where his attention was needed really fast, so he would arrange sessions with all the different teams‚Äîthe Cars team, the technology team, whatever‚Äîso there were a dozen or so people in each one. Then he would point to one person in each session and say:
Famous CEO continued: ‚ÄúThat person might offer something like, ‚ÄòThe design team isn‚Äôt open to new technology we‚Äôre building.‚Äô Jobs would ask others if they agreed. He would then choose someone else and say:
According to Famous CEO, Jobs would alternate between the two questions until he felt like he had a handle on what was going on.
Famous CEO said he ran sessions like these with his own teams every few months. He advised Young CEO to ‚Äúnever invite VPs‚Äù (i.e., team leaders) to the sessions, since subordinates might feel intimidated and share less freely. Instead, Famous CEO would commit, after collecting issues, to discussing them with the VP in charge, who would be responsible for following up.
A few days later, I led a workshop on strategic narrative design with about 40 CEOs, salespeople, and marketers. Just before it was over, instead of simply asking ‚ÄúAny questions?‚Äù as I normally did (which typically won me a roomful of silence), I called on a woman who, judging from her active participation in the class, seemed like she wouldn‚Äôt mind being singled out.
I asked her this question, inspired by that third-hand Jobs wisdom:
I worded it like this to position any confusion as my failing, not my audience‚Äôs inability to understand. I was also careful not to phrase it as a ‚Äúyes-no‚Äù question (‚ÄúDid I make anything confusing?‚Äù), which might have been more likely to elicit a polite ‚Äúno.‚Äù
The woman said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still confused about how exactly the narrative elements fit together.‚Äù Of course, it was a question that I myself had been wrestling with for decades. My first reaction was to try to explain it to her in some different way, but instead I just said this:
The woman smiled, and her classmates seemed relieved. What I learned that day was how it puts my audiences at ease when I make a point to say how hard this stuff is (very), and how long it usually takes for most people to feel like they‚Äôve landed on the right story (weeks, months, years).
Later, I called on another participant and asked: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the thing you learned today that will most help you outside of this class?‚Äù As you can imagine, it was rewarding to hear about the positive impact I had made.
If you work with teams in any way, I recommend trying Jobs‚Äôs technique, my variation on it, or a variation of your own. And if you‚Äôre at Just For You Cafe, I recommend the crab cakes. They really are very good, even without the complimentary side of Silicon Valley wisdom.

Aytekin Tank|17.7K|5|https://medium.com/swlh/why-open-office-design-makes-you-less-productive-95d45ffba9eb?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|Why open office design makes you less productive ‚Äì The Startup ‚Äì Medium|"You‚Äôve probably heard about the recent expansion of Facebook‚Äôs Menlo Park campus. The new building, MK21, designed by Canadian starchitect Frank Gehry, is the pinnacle of today‚Äôs open office design trend.
For years, the open office design was touted as the new and improved workplace architecture.
If the late 90s brought us Office Space style ‚Äî dismal workspaces framed by lifeless, beige cubicle walls ‚Äî the 21st century ushered in bright, airy open-plan offices.
Like unlimited snacks and craft coffee on tap, the open office concept seemed revolutionary ‚Äî bound to improve the quality of an employee‚Äôs work experience.
Aesthetics aside, managers imagined that open offices would increase interactions between colleagues, and enhance cooperation and productivity.
Speaking about Facebook‚Äôs previous office building, MK20, also a Gehry-designed open office, Facebook‚Äôs then Chief People Officer said,
Apparently, even CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a designated place somewhere in the sea of desks. (Kudos to Zuckerberg for practicing what he preaches, if he does, in fact, work in the open office.)
Though the hype associated with open office spaces may make another day at the office seem a lot more appealing, the reality of these transparent offices ‚Äî in terms of employee interaction and productivity ‚Äî is a lot less clear.
The loud talker three desks down; constant taps on the shoulder; the guy who incessantly clicks his pen; the girl who eats a tuna sandwich al desko every afternoon.
Many find themselves more prone to distraction in open office layouts.
Since founding JotForm in 2006, we‚Äôve dabbled in different office designs. And as we‚Äôve grown to over 130 employees, we figured no other design felt like navigating a minefield ‚Äî opportunities for destruction are all around.
Many argue that open office design fosters communication between employees and such enhanced collaboration makes up for the negative impact distraction has on your team productivity.
But do open offices really boost collaboration?
In 2018, Harvard Business School Associate Professor Ethan Bernstein published a study analyzing the impacts of open workspaces on collaboration.
It was the first study of its kind to look empirically at how a transition to open offices affected employees‚Äô productivity and daily interactions.
Rather than increasing face-to-face collaborations, open architecture seemed to trigger a natural human response to socially withdraw from officemates and interact over email and instant messenger instead.
Beyond interactions, the study found that workers became less productive in open offices. What‚Äôs more important from a managerial perspective, the quality of work decreased as well.
In ‚ÄúFocus on productivity, not efficiency‚Äù, I wrote about the power of getting small teams to sit together in a private space.
For starters, our employees work in small cross-functional teams of 5‚Äì6 people.
Each team includes a lead designer, who works side-by-side with UI and CSS developers, full stack developers, plus UX specialists, data scientists, and any other necessary functions.
We‚Äôve found that teams that include a member from every different role are consistently more effective.
Each group has its own room, with a door that closes, big whiteboards, big desks, space to stretch out and various productivity tools.
These private spaces help our teams to stay focused. Without the distractions of an open office full of colleagues, they have no need for noise-canceling headphones.
A University of Sydney study found that the noise is the number one element that bothers employees about open offices. And the results of noise distraction were twofold: lower productivity and higher absentee rates.
A workspace that limits distraction isn‚Äôt just an HR decision ‚Äî it‚Äôs a financial one. The Information Overload Research Group estimates that such distraction costs U.S. companies almost $1 trillion dollars annually.
Instead of fighting with distraction, our cross-functional teams collaborate openly, not self-consciously, with their team members, and build off of each other‚Äôs energy.
It‚Äôs amazing how much these rooms have increased their productivity.
Even the aforementioned Facebook offices have what they call ‚Äúbreakaway pods.‚Äù I would imagine that many Facebook employees find themselves retreating to these pods for privacy, especially for projects that require intense focus.
We‚Äôre not the only ones that support the small team model. In 2014, researchers Albert Kao and Iain Couzin published a study demonstrating that:
Opinions may differ on the optimal size of a small team.
In one book from Harvard Business Press, the authors posit that:
I believe each organization is unique and it depends on the type of organization and what types of decisions and projects are being handled.
For us, requiring 7 people in each group would be excessive in many cases. But that‚Äôs a decision for each company to make based on its business circumstances.
Open offices don‚Äôt mean that the entire office will be collaborating on each project or decision. But I also don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre conducive to effective teamwork.
When it comes to your company, there‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all office design.
Though managers may prefer open office architecture, especially for the economic benefit, a growing body of research over the last years has been demonstrating the downside of open offices.
While cubicles feel dismal, they may be no worse in terms of productivity.
For JotForm, the happy medium has been private offices for small teams of employees.
Though this may not be a feasible option for all companies at all times of day, I would recommend at least offering part-time private spaces, like breakaway pods, to your employees.
It‚Äôs worth every bit of the investment in your team.

Tim Denning|44K|3|https://medium.com/the-mission/the-power-of-doing-only-one-thing-c58c11ddfce4?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|The Power Of Doing Only One Thing. ‚Äì The Mission ‚Äì Medium|"This idea of doing only one thing was sparked by an event that happened this week. I decided to delete all podcasts on my phone and only keep the Tim Ferriss Show. In other areas of my life, I‚Äôve done the same.
All the other things in the same category have been discarded. Here are some examples:
‚Äì I had two pairs of earphones and now I have one
‚Äì I‚Äôd read multiple books at the same time ‚Äî now I do one at a time
‚Äì I had multiple tools to cure stress and now I have one ‚Äî meditation
I then took this minimalistic approach from how I handled material possessions and applied it to what I do each day.
Here are some examples:
‚Äì I only pursue one passion now instead of many
‚Äì I only execute on one vision instead of many
‚Äì I only use my free time for one activity instead of many
If you look at each category of your life, you‚Äôll see that you spend a disproportionate amount of time in one area. I‚Äôve normally had a few passions but if I evaluate the last five years, most of my efforts have been put towards blogging.
I had a few other passions but I didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time doing them.
When I committed to doing one thing, I made a decision to stop pretending I cared about my other passions.
I listened to lots of podcasts until recently and I was constantly trying to keep up with the latest episodes. I found many of the podcasts shared similar messages and only one of them was life-changing in my eyes (The Tim Ferriss Podcast).
Now that I only listen to one podcast I can finally enjoy it, quit rushing and even playback episodes I‚Äôve listened to already. Seeing the podcast screen with only one show on there is so refreshing!
Look at your life and you‚Äôll see similar patterns.
Doing one thing gives you extreme focus. This focus can be channelled towards tasks that lead to mastery instead of trying to dabble in lots of unrelated passions.
Focus is how you reach states of flow and achieve results that look impossible.
Doing one thing causes you to focus and practice more. Through this process, you can see your failures, areas of improvement and areas that you‚Äôre good at. This form of reflection gives you real-time feedback that can further compound your results.
We can‚Äôt compute too many things at once. The power of doing one thing is that you avoid overwhelm. We can all manage one thing in each area of our life. The moment we introduce too many choices we end up with decision fatigue.
Overwhelm is selling yourself the false reality that you have to do everything to be successful. I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs the complete opposite.
To be successful, you have to focus and do one thing. Being successful is about not giving up and if you consistently put yourself into a state of overwhelm then you‚Äôll simultaneously increase your negative thought patterns.
This milkshake of negativity will mix together and end up in failure if you let it.
Overwhelm is the enemy of passion and energy. Passion and energy become hyper-focused when you focus on one thing.
One podcast.
One business.
One romantic partner.
One vision.
One passion.
Embrace the power of doing one thing.

Aytekin Tank|14.9K|10|https://medium.com/swlh/how-google-is-slowing-innovation-d53161108ea2?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|How Google is slowing innovation ‚Äì The Startup ‚Äì Medium|"It was 1995 and the universe was deep in battle...
A fearsome empire was striving for world domination and crushing their competitors with an iron fist.
Their strategy?
Meanwhile, an impertinent upstart was lurking in the wings ‚Äî one that would eventually bid to overcome the empire.
The upstart‚Äôs motto?
Ok, this might sound like the intro to a superhero movie.
But it‚Äôs the tale of two of the mightiest corporations of all time:
The killer twist?
The good guys turned to the dark side.
They took Microsoft‚Äôs rallying cry and made it their own.
I‚Äôm sitting in my favorite coffee shop as I write this. Their lattes are strong and the wifi is speedy.
Of course, once in a while, I have login problems, or poor data speeds ‚Äî but it‚Äôs rare.
It‚Äôs rare because hardware manufacturers and software developers have agreed on a standard. In fact, a few of them: as Andy Tanenbaum said,
Our modern world relies on people agreeing to work by common rules. And in the online sphere, this begins with open standards. As the principles state:
Think of good old plain text files.
For the English-speaking world, the underlying standard is ASCII, which sets down the rules for encoding the alphabet as 0s and 1s.
Now, imagine a universe in which you had to pay a $1 licensing fee every time you wanted to read or write a text file in ASCII. It would be a nightmare, right?
Luckily, that would never happen. Because we have rules.
Take HTML, the standard language for writing web pages, invented in the ‚Äô90s by Tim Berners-Lee.
The HTML specification has evolved over the years, and the W3C acts as a forum for gaining specification consensus from large players such as Adobe, Apple, Google, Intel, and Microsoft.
But there‚Äôs been a history of skirmishes, with different companies proposing their own variants. During the first browser wars, Netscape proposed a <blink> tag, while Microsoft came up with <marquee>, which was meant to cause text to scroll in various directions.
There‚Äôs no problem with that (apart from lousy aesthetics), right? Wrong. Because only Netscape Navigator knew what to do with <blink>, and only Internet Explorer knew what to do with <marquee>.
They were modifying a standard so that it would only run with their software.
They were trying to build a monopoly.
Microsoft famously coined the phrase ‚Äúembrace, extend, extinguish‚Äù to describe their strategy for dominating markets where competitors benefited from open standards.
Here‚Äôs an example of how it played out.
Back in the day, the most powerful PC software package was Lotus 1‚Äì2‚Äì 3. It was the classic killer app for the IBM PC and Microsoft‚Äôs MS-DOS operating system.
To overcome Lotus, Microsoft knew it had to embrace what made the product unique. This meant it had to load Lotus files and the macros that came with them. Enter Excel, a spreadsheet program that initially ran on Macs.
The functionality of Excel was as similar to Lotus as it could be without being a blatant rip-off. So close, in fact, that people could switch from Lotus to Excel with minimal pain.
What‚Äôs more, Microsoft used the graphics capabilities of Macs to equip Excel with a cool GUI. This was a leap ahead of standard MS-DOS packages like Lotus 1‚Äì2‚Äì3.
Next, Microsoft extended by creating Office: the holy trinity of Excel, Word, and Powerpoint, all running together on Windows. By 1995, these programs were working together well, and although there were a number of word processors to choose from, there weren‚Äôt any compelling competitors for Excel on Windows.
Microsoft sharpened their competitive edge with company discounts and clever Office 95 marketing, and as a result, most major businesses were adopting it as their standardized software suite ‚Äî and Excel was part of the bundle. No need to buy a standalone package like Lotus 1‚Äì2‚Äì3.
Meanwhile, Symphony ‚Äî the Lotus integrated package for MS-DOS that aimed to compete with Office ‚Äî never prospered and was eventually abandoned. Microsoft had officially extinguished Lotus 1‚Äì2‚Äì3.
They wanted Office to become the gold standard for productivity software. And they succeeded. But not long after establishing the dominance of their desktop operating system, Microsoft realized that another challenge was looming.
Not only could people browse websites that were outside Microsoft‚Äôs control, but Netscape introduced the JavaScript scripting language which allowed developers to write code that ran in the browser. In effect, Netscape was inventing a new operating system, distributed between the client-side browser and the remote server.
Even worse, content on the web was platform-agnostic: browsers worked just fine on Macs and Unix as well as Windows, so an application that ran in the browser would rip open the Microsoft business model.
In order to get a piece of the action, Microsoft launched Internet Explorer (IE) in 1995 as a direct competitor to Netscape Navigator. Initially, it only had a tiny market share: less than 10% by the close of 1996. So this was more of an air kiss than a full embrace of the internet.
Things heated up with the release of IE3, bundled as a free component of Windows in 1996, and integrating a number of apps that were part of the Microsoft ecosystem: an internet mail client (later to become Outlook Express), an address book, and the Windows Media Player. IE4 continued the extend theme by bundling programs for the chat and video conferencing.
At the same time, Microsoft re-engineered the Windows desktop look and feel to make it more like browsing a web page. How did Netscape Navigator fit into this cozy set up?
Not at all ‚Äî it functioned increasingly worse on the Microsoft operating system. By the end of the decade, Internet Explorer had 86% of the browser market.
- Game over for Netscape.
Today, Microsoft is working hard to shed its ‚Äòevil‚Äô reputation, contributing to open source and supporting open standards.
But we may have a new villain on our hands...
It was March 31, 2004.
The headlines were in a frenzy:
At the time, the news seemed outrageous. A search engine company? Launching a free email service? With an alleged storage capacity of 1GB ‚Äî 500 times bigger than what Microsoft‚Äôs Hotmail offered?!
In fact, when April 1st rolled around and Google issued a press release officially announcing Gmail, most people took it as a far-fetched hoax.
Boasting massive storage, a slick interface, instant search, and personalization options, it was real ‚Äî and revolutionary.
Not only did Gmail blow Hotmail and Yahoo Mail out of the water, but it was also the first app with the potential to replace conventional PC software.
According to Georges Harik, who was responsible for most of Google‚Äôs new products at the time:
Google had officially extended email. And, while they didn‚Äôt extinguish other email providers entirely, they certainly came close.
Then there‚Äôs AMP. The Accelerated Mobile Pages Project (AMP) is a technology that enables web pages to load more rapidly on mobile devices.
AMP was originally targeted at news publishers, to compete with Facebook‚Äôs Instant Articles, but it has now far outstripped the latter, after being adopted by platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, and LinkedIn
As a strategy, AMP is Google‚Äôs most brazen. It serves as a vehicle for routing users through the Google Content Delivery Network even if they‚Äôre reading content from other websites. Sites that don‚Äôt adopt AMP get pushed out of Google mobile search results and into oblivion.
Or, extinguished.
There‚Äôs also the infamous case of Google Reader, which dug the grave for RSS (Rich Site Summary).
RSS‚Äôs decline was evident before Google axed it, but killing Reader dealt a massive blow to any of RSS‚Äôs remaining momentum. Google said themselves they wanted to consolidate users onto the rest of their services ‚Äî none of which support any open syndication standards.
Tech writer Ed Bott summarizes eloquently:
Last but not least, there‚Äôs PDF.
To recap:
PDFs have a feature that allows forms to be submitted. This feature previously worked on all PDF viewers (such as Adobe Acrobat and Apple Preview). That is until Chrome started their own viewers for PDF files.
As Google‚Äôs browser gained market share (now hitting over 60% in the usage stakes), most people began viewing PDFs in Chrome‚Äôs native PDF reader. But, here‚Äôs the kicker: Chrome doesn‚Äôt support all of PDF‚Äôs features.
For example, my company, JotForm, has a feature called fillable PDF Forms. It lets you create PDF forms, which you can submit.
So, forms created with Adobe or JotForm‚Äôs PDF tool often don‚Äôt work on Chrome. We have to instruct people to use Adobe Acrobat instead, which creates needless friction.
In a nutshell, Google‚Äôs behavior prevents us from investing more deeply in the PDF Forms.
So all of this begs the question:
Does Google really support open source?
In 1995, it was Microsoft vs. Netscape.
In 2018, it‚Äôs Google vs. Apple.
The only difference lies in strategy. Google is playing the long game to take Apple down.
Rather than create products that are a dramatic improvement on Apple‚Äôs, they make them almost-as-good, or equally good ‚Äî and cheaper.
Take Chromebooks. They aren‚Äôt as slick and speedy as Macbooks. But they offer similar usability ‚Äî and you can buy three for the cost of one iPad. Plus, they‚Äôre brilliantly marketed.
Or Android. It‚Äôs as close a replica to iOS as you can imagine.
Or Pixel. Compared to the iPhone, it has a better camera, faster charging, smoother performance, and a more useful digital assistant, for a lower price.
Google is extending with their growing selection of products, including an Amazon Echo competitor, a smart router, TV, a VR headset, and a list of nest devices. Although these products will work mostly with iOS devices, they will work better with Android phones, and/or the Pixel.
All of these factors make migration look increasingly more promising. Apple has been cutting manufacturing costs while pricing its products ever higher, which means the user experience has plummeted.
Not to mention the scandal that erupted when we learned that Apple deliberately slows older products in a bid to encourage users to upgrade.
All of these factors lay fertile ground for Google to overtake Apple.
In fact, Apple customer loyalty is arguably the only real obstacle in Google‚Äôs way. But if enough people get frustrated with Apple‚Äôs pricing strategy, it could signal the end of Apple‚Äôs reign as we know it.
Twenty years ago, the browser wars were raging.
There was stiff competition ‚Äî and that was a good thing because it prevented a monopoly.
With competition comes innovation. In fact, this period of intense rivalry led to the web we have now.
The Big Tech Five continue to swallow up smaller companies. And as their monopoly grows, I‚Äôd argue that innovation is dwindling.
Openness and added value are being sacrificed at the altar of revenue and market share. And Google is at the forefront of this. Most recently, Chrome announced their ‚Äúmost controversial initiative yet‚Äù: fundamentally rethinking URLs across the web. Without a URL, the only way to access a page is via Google.
Ed Bott compares Google to Godzilla:
And he‚Äôs right. Google‚Äôs convenience and power are overwhelming. But we can‚Äôt let that blind us to the reality of what they‚Äôre doing.
However you look at it, embrace, extend, extinguish is pivotal to Google‚Äôs strategy. Granted, no one in Google is sending explicit instructions as Bill Gates once did, but they don‚Äôt need to ‚Äî the end result is the same.
EEE certainly looks different today than it did in 2000; it‚Äôs subtler, friendlier, more politically correct.
But it‚Äôs just as dangerous. The war isn‚Äôt over. We must fight to diversify the internet, uphold open standards, and stamp out monopoly.

Do you abandon them, or do you finish what you start?
Juggling multiple ideas and goals ‚Äî to write, exercise, read more, wake up early and so on ‚Äî is a tough gig that often begins with excitement, but ends with procrastination, and failure to finish any one of the ideas we started.
Here are 5 different things to do when you‚Äôre overwhelmed with too many ideas and goals.
In 2003, Sheena Iyengar, Psychologist and Professor at Columbia Business School, conducted an 800,000 employee strong study, to investigate the effects that adding more investment choices had on their participation in retirement saving plans. [1]
At the end of the study period, the researchers gathered the data and plotted the results to answer the question: would more employees participate in retirement saving plans, if more investment choices were made available to them?
As we‚Äôd predict, the answer is yes. Afterall, more choice is better. And so, this would be the researchers' conclusion.
Or, was it?
The researchers discovered that adding more investment choices, reduced the likelihood that employees would participate in retirement saving plans.
As per the diagram above, for every 10 funds added to the array of options, the rate of participation drops by 2 percent. In fact, for those employees who chose to invest, adding more investment choices increased the chances that employees would invest in more conservative funds.
This is the paradox of choice. More choice often leads to less action. The more ideas and goals we pursue, the less likely we‚Äôll follow through on any one of them. And vice versa.
There are other explanations for why we fail to finish what we start. Lack of time, fear of failure, overwhelm from multiple choices that drain energy and a decline of excitement after starting a new project, can lead to chronic procrastination.
When we get stuck in motion at rest, instead of motion in action, our time and energy are wasted on efforts that produce little results.
Here are five different ways to avoid overwhelm, get started and follow through on your ideas.
1. Create mini-deadlines.
The more time it takes to complete a task, the greater the likelihood that we fall victim to ‚ÄòParkinson‚Äôs Law,‚Äô which states that, work expands to fill the time available for its completion.
For example, if you have one week to complete a three-hour task, according to Parkinson‚Äôs law, the task will increase in complexity and keep dragging on for the duration of the week. The best way to combat this problem, is to create mini-deadlines that force you to finish tasks within a short time frame.
Action: Create a list of your daily tasks and note approximately, how much time it takes to complete each one of them. Then, cut the time limit of each task in half. Aim to finish each task by these deadlines.
2. Use the 80/20 rule.
In layman‚Äôs terms, the 80/20 rule suggests that twenty percent of the what you do contributes to eighty percent of the results you get. In other words, each task can be broken down into activities that either fall into the twenty or eighty percent group.
For example, if your goal is to exercise more and lose weight, there are some exercises ‚Äî the twenty percent, like high intensity sprints ‚Äî that will significantly contribute to weight loss, more so than others ‚Äî the eighty percent, like stretching.
The key is to experiment, discover and focus your time and energy on the twenty percent activities, that yield the greatest returns. This way, you can get more done by doing less ‚Äî and in less time.
3. Trust your gut.
Often, we hesitate to get started and take action on ideas, because of the fear of failure, rejection and self-doubt. Countless hours are spent researching and planning to take action, but when it comes time to jump ship, we stay on the boat and fail to follow through on our plans.
In the book Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking (audiobook), world-renowned journalist and author, Malcolm Gladwell, makes a strong case that, often, snap judgements made within seconds, lead to better decisions than a more cautious, thoroughly planned approach.
Next time you‚Äôre not sure of what to do next or how to do it, trust your gut instinct and take action on the first thought that crosses your mind, because more times than not, you‚Äôll probably be on the right track.
4. Develop the habit of finishing.
Many people have mastered the art of starting, but few have built the habit of finishing. Starting is easier than finishing, but the bulk of the results we seek, lie at the finish line.
The process of building the habit of finishing, is just like any other habit. First, you start small and build up, with a reasonable expectation of how long it will take to form a habit.
Then, you can make small changes to your environment to make it easier to finish whatever you set out to do.
5. Practice Quitting.
Contrary to popular opinion, the most productive, successful people, quit on their goals all the time ‚Äî they just know what to quit and when to do so.
The upside of quitting is that you redirect time and energy wasted on an unfruitful idea or goal, towards another more rewarding venture.
Here‚Äôs a quick inventory check. If the costs of pursuing an idea has outweighed the benefits ‚Äî over a period of time ‚Äî perhaps it‚Äôs time to consider cutting your losses. Although it may hurt at first, down the line, you‚Äôll free up more time to focus on better ideas.
Whilst it can be exciting to start new ideas and goals, if we don‚Äôt finish what we start, valuable time and energy ‚Äî that can‚Äôt be recovered ‚Äî will go to waste.
Falling in love with starting is easy. Falling in love with finishing is hard. But, if you can learn to fall in love with the art of finishing ‚Äî and the process of overcoming adversity, failures and working around obstacles ‚Äî you‚Äôll consistently follow through on your ideas.

Benjamin P. Hardy|20K|10|https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/heres-how-to-know-if-you-re-going-to-live-your-dreams-1ecf65b92e60?source=tag_archive---------8---------------------|How To Know If You‚Äôll Live Your Dreams ‚Äì Benjamin P. Hardy ‚Äì Medium|"The Alchemist is among the top 25 most selling books of all time. If you haven‚Äôt read it yet, do so immediately.
In the book, a young boy meets an African King who teaches the boy how to live out his ‚ÄúPersonal Legend,‚Äù or life purpose.
Most people are content simply dreaming about their dreams ‚Äî that is enough for them. Only those who are willing to pursue their dreams will see the ‚Äúomens‚Äù along the way ‚Äî what most consider luck or coincidence.
When you become willing to sacrifice everything to discover and live your life‚Äôs purpose, as The Alchemist relates, ‚Äúall the universe will conspire to make it happen.‚Äù
38 time NYT-bestselling author, Richard Paul Evans, has a concept he calls the ‚ÄúFive Kingdoms.‚Äù Kingdom One is reserved for only yourself and your connection to your higher power (or whatever you prescribe to). No other human being is allowed in your First Kingdom. The problem, Evans‚Äô explains, is that people allow their spouses, friends, and others into their First Kingdom.
This clouds and confuses everything. It sends you on a path of conformity.
You must live in alignment with yourself, first and foremost. Otherwise, you have no powerful, conviction, or clarity to offer your relationships. You‚Äôre just a clone of whatever others want you to be. You have no sense of being and no clear purpose in life. The only way to truly live congruently in life AND in your relationships is to be congruent with yourself.
In order to fully live out your dreams, you must understand and embrace the following truths:
Whether you live out your dreams or not, life will be a struggle. It may be more convenient to settle-in to a life of mediocrity, but even still, life will be a struggle.
You‚Äôll have to struggle through jobs you hate.
You‚Äôll have to struggle through relationships that crumble due to lack of confidence, clarity, and openness. The only way to truly be powerful and present in your relationships is to live in congruence with yourself. Otherwise, you always appear and act in weakness in all of your relationships. You can‚Äôt fake it. It‚Äôs subconscious and energetic.
Deep inside of you will be a gnawing regret for the life you could be living and the person you could be. Even more, you‚Äôll realize the negative impact your lack of congruence is having on those around you. To quote Dr. Stephen R. Covey, ‚ÄúWe control our actions, but the consequences that flow from those actions are controlled by principles.‚Äù
Similarly, the famed surgeon and religious leader, Russell Nelson, said ‚ÄúDecisions you first thought to be purely personal virtually always impact the lives of others... You must be mindful of the broader circle of family and friends who will be affected by the consequences of your choice[s].‚Äù
If you‚Äôre a parent, your children are intensely affected by your choices. If you‚Äôre out of alignment with yourself, how do you expect them to live a life of alignment?
If you‚Äôre out of alignment, how do you expect them to truly respect you? Of course they‚Äôll love you. No matter who you are, you deserve love. No matter where you are or what you‚Äôve done, you need other people to help you. The opposite of addiction is connection. Rather than judgment, what people need to get out of their dark hole or negative pattern is compassion. You can‚Äôt punish the pain out of people.
Similarly, you can‚Äôt punish yourself for not living in alignment with yourself. That won‚Äôt help you. What you need is connection ‚Äî with yourself and other people. The longer you attempt to fight a silent battle through grit and willpower, the deeper you‚Äôll bury yourself in your own negative cycles. You‚Äôre as sick as your secrets. You need to vulnerable and honest. Otherwise all relationships and situations around you are artificial.
Is there challenge and pain in living your dreams?
Are you often clueless as to what you‚Äôre doing and where you‚Äôre going?
Does it sometimes feel you‚Äôve sacrificed too much?
Of course. But even in the midst of enormous difficulty, you‚Äôll be living congruently. And nothing external is more important or powerful than being at peace with yourself.
The attachment of what you presently own will stop you from making a concrete decision and commitment to pursue your dreams.
The act of decision and commitment is generally tied to the donating of money (or possession) in some form of fashion. When you begin giving your money away, it starts to flow back to you much more powerfully. Because you‚Äôre not holding on to it so tightly. You realize you can have as much of it as you want. You begin being far more generous.
If you haven‚Äôt yet committed to making the decision to live your life in congruence ‚Äî it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre still holding on too tightly to what you have. You need to being willing to give it all away.
What you‚Äôre holding on to is the price of what you could have. Your scarcity mindset is keeping you stuck. You‚Äôll know you‚Äôre ready when you start giving away what you‚Äôve got to a cause you believe in ‚Äî or to other people in need.
Once you start mindfully giving your money away, you‚Äôll open yourself up getting much much more. The reason is simple, it is the act of donating your money that cements within you the DECISION to live your life more powerfully.
In the book, MAKE YOUR BED, Admiral William McRaven tells the story of training to become a Special Operations Officer for the Navy Seals. The most intense training program imaginable.
According to Admiral McRaven...
According to the Biopsychological Theory of Personality, all behavior is either triggered by your ‚ÄúBehavioral Activation System‚Äù (BAS) or ‚ÄúBehavioral Inhibition System‚Äù (BIS).
Your BAS activates your behavior and moves you forward, despite risks. Your BIS inhibits your behavior and stops you from moving forward, because of risks.
According to the Strategic Principle of War, ‚ÄúThe best defense is a good offense.‚Äù
In his book, When Violence Is the Answer: Learning How to Do What It Takes When Your Life Is at Stake, Tim Larkin explains that when you‚Äôre in a hostile situation, if you‚Äôre hesitant, you‚Äôll lose.
If you‚Äôre retreating backwards, that‚Äôs exactly what a perpetrator wants you to do.
If you hold your arms up in a fighting position ‚Äî you‚Äôre also in a position of weakness, because you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre going to do. You‚Äôre acting socially ‚Äî being reactive ‚Äî and you‚Äôve given your power of choice to them.
The only way to successfully win in a hostile situation is to aggressively move forward on the offensive. This is exactly the opposite of what a perpetrator is expecting. And it‚Äôs the only truly powerful defensive.
When you‚Äôve committed fully to living in complete congruence, despite the risk ‚Äî when you‚Äôve passed your point of no return ‚Äî you will often be in positions where you‚Äôre required to risk it all. To go on complete offensive.
Of course, you likely won‚Äôt be required to risk it all. But you must be willing to. It must be YOUR decision, not indecision that determines what happens. And if you‚Äôre in alignment with your First Kingdom, you‚Äôll follow your gut and know what to do ‚Äî and you won‚Äôt let the opinions of others cloud your final decision.
You will likely be very misunderstood. The cost will seem too high to most people. They aren‚Äôt operating at the same level as you. They don‚Äôt realize that your security is internal, and that you‚Äôre no longer tied to the outcome. You‚Äôre simply tied to living in congruence with what you believe you should do.
Sometimes, you‚Äôll have lots of money coming your way and be required to give it all back to what you‚Äôre trying to accomplish. Consider Elon Musk, who was willing to sink all of his money into his companies. Had he not been willing to do that, he probably wouldn‚Äôt be where he is today.
Money for him is a tool. Not something he‚Äôs attached to. He doesn‚Äôt work to make money. He makes money to do more work. He makes money to fuel the mission.
In an interview with SuccessMagazine, actor Jeremy Piven explained that as an actor, the only way to work is to go out and audition for specific roles.
The challenge most actors/actresses face is that they get in their own way. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much homework they‚Äôve done. If they‚Äôre too tied to a specific result, they can‚Äôt be present in the moment. They can‚Äôt truly perform their art. They come off as desperate. They get in their own way. Their performance isn‚Äôt what it could have been.
Jeremy said that when he quit worrying about a specific result, he was able to be present during his auditions. He was able to be completely who he wanted to be. He wasn‚Äôt trying to be what he thought others wanted him to be. He performed his art.
If he didn‚Äôt get the gig, either they didn‚Äôt get it or it just wasn‚Äôt the right fit. So he moves on to the next. In this way, he‚Äôs able to get the jobs he‚Äôs supposed to have. He‚Äôs not just trying to get anything he can get.
According to Robert Kegan, Harvard Psychologist, the only way to truly experience the highest levels of transformation and ‚Äúconscious evolution‚Äù is to detach from the need for specific outcomes.
THIS specific outcomes isn‚Äôt what matters. THIS outcome, regardless of what it is ‚Äî win or lose ‚Äî has no bearing on what you‚Äôre committed to doing and being. You‚Äôre fully committed and invested. You‚Äôve already made the decision. And in your mind, you already know what you are. So THIS outcome doesn‚Äôt affect any of that.
You won‚Äôt be derailed by success nor defeat ‚Äî as most people are. You‚Äôve already made a decision. You‚Äôre committed to that decision. And you will move forward regardless of what happens here.
Living your dreams is available to everyone. Whether you choose to live your dreams or not, your life will be a struggle and a challenge.
Joe Polish, founder of Genius Network often says, ‚ÄúLife is easy when you live it the hard way, and hard when you live it the easy way.‚Äù
However, you will age yourself much quicker due to internal conflict if you choose the struggle of fear, conformity, indecision, and selfishness.
You have the option of evolving to very powerful places and having transformative experiences if you‚Äôre willing to. You won‚Äôt regret it. Your life will be far fuller and more powerful. The relationships you have will be deeper and more meaningful.
You‚Äôll have a sense of purpose ‚Äî and other people will respect you for that.

That‚Äôs how I felt.
Tucked beneath what may have been the world‚Äôs softest blanket.
I took a deep breath and rolled onto my side. It was a familiar moment ‚Äî the moment when my 6 a.m. alarm clock sounded, after a night of tossing and turning.
The moment when my daily responsibilities had yet to beckon me. The moment when the clouds of my imagination felt more real than writing lines of code.
In a few minutes, I would answer the same question I had faced every weekday for the past year:
At the time, I was working as a programmer for an NYC media company.
Balancing a full-time job with the responsibilities of scaling my startup, JotForm, taught me a lot about myself.
Among other things, I learned that I was somewhat risk-averse.
The typical path of raising venture capital wasn‚Äôt appealing to me. Additionally, as someone who highly values personal freedom, I didn‚Äôt want to make myself beholden to anyone.
This meant two things:
I want to share my experience of overcoming procrastination while scaling a side project into a company that now employs more than 130 people.
But before diving in, it might be interesting to take a look at how two types of founders handle procrastination: VC-backed founders vs bootstrappers who build their startups without any outside funding.
Bootstrappers like myself aren‚Äôt the only entrepreneurs who sometimes grapple with the snooze button.
However, VC-backed founders may have a slight psychological advantage when compared to their bootstrapping counterparts: The pressure that comes with taking someone else‚Äôs money.
But that‚Äôs not all.
VC-backed founders are motivated to ‚Äúpay investors back‚Äù sooner rather than later for another reason: Once a company has grown accustomed to a certain level of spending, scaling back becomes next to impossible.
Should the company fail to gain traction within 12 to 18 months, it could very well become another failure statistic.
Thus, the VC-backed founder who doesn‚Äôt feel like sending out emails Monday morning has every incentive to do so.
Conversely, the bootstrapper must learn how to push through procrastination ‚Äî without the motivating force of a ticking clock and a room full of unhappy investors.
I encountered this learning curve while building JotForm in 2006. It was my first year in business, and my bedroom served as the company headquarters.
While I loved what I was building ‚Äî a user-friendly form builder to help organizations enhance productivity ‚Äî the temptation to procrastinate sometimes got the best of me.
Whether it was the lull of my comfy bed or the laughter promised by a favorite TV show, my home office was riddled with distractions.
During this time, I read many books about entrepreneurship, productivity, and procrastination. Sometimes their advice worked for me, and other times it didn‚Äôt.
When I became especially curious about the topic of procrastination, I often wondered:
Through self-observation, one thing became clear: There was always a reason for my procrastination.
Whenever I noticed the urge to put something off, I tried to ask myself ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù Surely enough, my mind always answered.
Once I had identified the real problem ‚Äî that was causing the feeling of avoidance ‚Äî I could develop an appropriate plan of action to reclaim my productivity.
As simple as it sounds, identifying the root problem is somewhat contrary to common advice. The internet is filled with articles that advise us to push through feelings of resistance.
Heidi Grant, a social psychologist, and Harvard Business Review contributor, echoes this sentiment:
While I completely agree and have often written about how organizational systems can enhance productivity, I believe something extremely important is often overlooked:
‚ÄúJust do it‚Äù isn‚Äôt a sustainable solution for beating chronic procrastination. If we repeatedly find ourselves avoiding certain tasks, an underlying problem needs to be addressed.
Once we identify the real cause, we can search for the right productivity hacks and solutions to meet our needs.
Here are the most common reasons that I figured often lead us to procrastinate:
Think back to the last time you started a new project. You probably felt excited about executing that new marketing strategy, blog content idea, or programming stack.
Fast forward a couple of weeks, and you now find yourself approaching the same task with a twinge of discouragement.
Observe your procrastinating mind in action, and it‚Äôs probably saying something like: My hard work isn‚Äôt being rewarded; this isn‚Äôt fun.
Science says humans are intrinsically more motivated by instant gratification than delayed gratification. Considering that worthwhile projects are rarely built overnight, this tendency is annoyingly inconvenient. The solution?
Stanford University behavioral scientist and lecturer BJ Fogg recommends creating systematic behavioral changes that correspond with ‚Äúsmall wins.‚Äù
In other words, create your own way to celebrate small milestones. According to Fogg, every task should be accompanied by ‚Äúa trigger‚Äù ‚Äî and the easier the action better.
Say you‚Äôre committed to writing content for your new website. You might make an agreement with yourself to write one paragraph after each time you use the restroom, and continue to follow this trigger throughout the day.
Once you‚Äôve completed the task, Fogg urges you to celebrate in a predetermined manner. The celebration could be as simple as treating yourself to a piece of chewing gum or as active as taking a bike ride through a favorite part of town.
Treat the series of actions like a game:
Why does this work? Creating small wins provides an incentive to keep working toward the finish line. Eventually, the actions create a habit that may become enjoyable.
Another common reason for procrastination? Having so much to do that we‚Äôre not sure where to begin.
During the early days of building JotForm, I wasn‚Äôt always sure what to work on. With seemingly endless tasks begging for my attention, I often ended up ‚Äúprocrastinating‚Äù with low-value activities.
Based on my conversations with other founders, I know my experience was far from unique. A lack of organizational systems leads to unnecessary feelings of overwhelm, confusion and avoidance.
Here‚Äôs the key:
The more systems we put in place, the less we find ourselves procrastinating. I‚Äôm reminded of the importance of this each year when I visit my family. They own a small olive farm that runs like a well-oiled machine.
Everyone knows what needs to happen first, second and third when we harvest the fruit. With no room for guesswork, procrastination is virtually non-existent.
This is the unofficial mantra of Silicon Valley tech founders.
However, look beneath the surface, and a different image will emerge: ambitious entrepreneurs who are terrified of making a bad decision.
As one anonymous insider shared with management consultant and Forbes contributor Rob Asghar:
While some founders cope by taking shortcuts, others stall out due to perfectionism. The tendency shows up in the form of delayed launch dates, missed deadlines, and ‚Äúproductive procrastination.‚Äù
During the early days, it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for me to spend a ridiculous amount of time on tasks that didn‚Äôt really matter.
Meanwhile, I was missing out on opportunities to grow our customer base, forge business partnerships, and help even more organizations enhance their productivity with user-friendly forms.
This was another reason I made the controversial decision to forego venture capital. I knew the pressure of a board looking over my shoulder would clash with my inner perfectionist.
Does that mean I never procrastinated for fear of failure? No ‚Äî but I could be gentle with myself when it happened.
Hendrickson recommends that we should consistently remind ourselves of the crucial difference between who we are and what we achieve.
Easier said than done, but it‚Äôs sound advice.
Surprise, surprise ‚Äî the most common reason for procrastination may actually be disliking the task at hand.
It‚Äôs no secret that building a business involves several moving parts. Understandably, everyone enjoys some tasks more than others.
One person may have an affinity for cold email campaigns, while another would rather play in traffic.
In such instances, HBR contributor Heidi Grant recommends using something she calls ‚Äúif-then planning.‚Äù The process involves identifying the specific steps needed to complete a task and ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî where and when you will do it.
For example: If it‚Äôs 11 a.m. then I will stop what I‚Äôm doing and cold email prospects.
Grant claims the process is different than relying on sheer willpower alone.
Personally, I find it more effective to ask targeted questions:
Once I reconnect with my goals and remind myself of the potential outcomes, I‚Äôm back on track. Obviously, there is no ‚Äúright way‚Äù to deal with procrastination.
These are just some of the methods that have worked for me over the years. Everyone has unique personality quirks, internal motivations, and reasons for procrastinating.
Translation: The newest productivity hack everyone is raving about may not work for you. And that‚Äôs okay.
Identify your personal reasons for procrastinating, apply the best-suited advice and ignore the rest.
Oh, and do your best not to hit snooze ‚Äî no matter how cozy your bed might feel.

Benjamin P. Hardy|3.4K|18|https://medium.com/thrive-global/harvard-research-justin-timberlake-movie-how-to-upgrade-your-economic-status-d702a2d28256?source=---------0---------------------|Harvard Research + Justin Timberlake Movie: How To Upgrade Your Economic Status|"In the Science Fiction film, ‚ÄúIn Time,‚Äù Justin Timberlake portrays a character named Will Salas, who lives in the ghetto.
In the movie, there is no ‚Äúmoney.‚Äù Instead, time is the only currency, and everyone has a digital clock embedded into their arms.
Until the age of 25, your clock doesn‚Äôt start ticking. Once you hit your 25th birthday, you have just one year of life that starts ticking down immediately.
Everything costs time. For example, in the movie, a cup of coffee doesn‚Äôt cost 4 dollars, but rather, 4 minutes.
There are small devices, similar to the devices we plug our credit cards into, that add or take away time when scanned on a person‚Äôs arm clock.
After age 25, you stop physically aging. Whether you‚Äôre 28, 49, or 302, you look as you did when your clock started ticking.
You live as long as you have time.
The people living in the ghetto are living day-to-day, while those in the highest ‚ÄúTime Zone‚Äù can conceivably live forever.
In the ghetto, people literally are living day-to-day. They get time added to their ‚Äúclocks‚Äù at the end of every shift ‚Äî enough to get them to the end of the next shift. They rarely have more than 24 hours on their clocks. As a result, they can‚Äôt stop thinking about or ‚Äúchecking‚Äù their time.
They are required to work, every single day, in order to survive.
As soon as your clock runs out, you die.
In the movie, Economic Status is portrayed as ‚ÄúTime Zones,‚Äù which are not easy to transfer one for another.
You have to pay a great deal of time to get from one zone to the next. Here‚Äôs the break-down:
To cross a Time Zone, you are required to pay a great deal of money.
For someone living in the ghetto, the system is not designed to ever have a full month saved-up. Thus, ever getting out the ghetto is practically impossible.
When you‚Äôre living day-to-day, time goes very quickly. You have no future to look forward to. You don‚Äôt have time to vacation and think. You‚Äôre in survival mode.
Hence, time goes very quickly.
Will Salas (played by Timberlake) finds his way out of the ghetto and into New Grenich and despite his best acting, is clearly perceived by others as being from somewhere else.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not from here are you, Mr. Salas?‚Äù the waitress asks him.
‚ÄúWhat gives you that impression?‚Äù Will responds.
‚ÄúYou do everything too quickly,‚Äù she responds back.
As you go up in ‚ÄúTime Zones,‚Äù life slows down. You‚Äôre no longer living day-to-day, perhaps now you‚Äôre living month-to-month.
You have a little more time to waste on entertainment and, perhaps, if you‚Äôre one of the smart ones, you begin investing a little here and a little there into your future.
But even still, the cost of living goes up with each Time Zone you‚Äôre in. So it‚Äôs not exactly easy to save up.
You have to keep up with your neighbors, for example. You‚Äôre required, socially, to have a car and home that fits the culture. The food costs just a little bit more, and so do your clothes. Life is driven by marketing and social acceptance for most people.
Making money is one thing, managing it is entirely different.
In New Grenich, it can cost a few month‚Äôs of ‚ÄúTime‚Äù to stay in a hotel and several weeks to eat a fancy meal.
Money, or in this case, ‚ÄúTime,‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean the same in different zones.
Spending 8 weeks for a meal can, strangely, make complete sense in one situation, where that much ‚ÄúTime‚Äù is enough to get you killed in the ghetto. Those 8 weeks could change the entire trajectory of a family living in the ghetto...if they knew what to do with it.
To even get into New Grenich (i.e., among the mega-wealthy) costs One Year of Time. Once you‚Äôre in, everything costs a fortune. However, the ability to make money in that Zone is also completely skewed as well.
Although the ideas from In Time is science-fiction in nature, they actually have real life application based on Harvard Economics.
A few economists at Harvard began a project known as ‚ÄúThe Equality Of Opportunities Project,‚Äù several years ago. The research was so revolutionary and important that it has since expanded into something much bigger and more global.
The goal of the project, ‚ÄúIs to develop scalable policy solutions that will empower families throughout the United States to rise out of poverty and achieve better life outcomes.‚Äù
One of the fundamental outcomes they‚Äôve discovered in their research is that location matters, a lot. As it states on the website: Children‚Äôs lives are shaped by the neighborhood they grow up in.
As part of the research, each county within each state was measured for its ‚Äúsocial mobility,‚Äù which is a term that explains the chances of someone advancing in economic status within their lifetime.
As they state on the website:
Put simply, proximity matters. Environment matters. Where you are born matters. Where you choose to stay matters.
The reason is very simple; within any given environment or ‚Äúsystem,‚Äù are a set of options. You can only make choices if you have options. Let me repeat that, you can only make choices if you have options.
This idea became starkly real to me when my wife and I moved from Orem, Utah, a county in the 90th percentile for upward social mobility, to Clemson, South Carolina where I began my PhD research in Organizational Psychology.
Shortly after moving to Clemson, my wife and I became foster parents of three children who were from a county bordering Clemson, Oconee, which happens to be in the 9% percentile of upward social mobility.
Put simply, if you‚Äôre born poor in Oconee County, your chances of breaking out of poverty are slim to none if you stay in Oconee County. As economic strategists and analyst, Mark Caine, has said, ‚ÄúThe first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself.‚Äù
It was clear when we got our children that they came from a different world than we did. They didn‚Äôt really know how to act in our environment, and we had to learn patience, empathy, and love beyond anything we‚Äôd previously been exposed to.
As they say, you can‚Äôt develop courage without the lion. You can‚Äôt develop empathy and love without being required to give it. Life, then, becomes the ultimate context for growth if you‚Äôre willing to put yourself in situations that force you out of your comfort zone.
Our three kids were incredibly limited by their prior environment. They didn‚Äôt have many options. They had parents who were generally high on drugs and didn‚Äôt have the capacity to provide a good life, let alone healthy food and a ride to school, to their children.
When our kids were placed in our care, their availability of options radically expanded. Because they had more and better options to choose from, they then had a different set of choices. In other words, their ability to exercise their ‚Äúfree-will‚Äù was expanded.
Again, you cannot make choices without options. And options are context-dependent, which means every environment or ‚Äúcontext‚Äù provides different options.
Because no two people have the same context, no two people have the same ‚Äúfree-will.‚Äù Instead, we all have what social psychologist, Jeffrey Reber, calls, ‚ÄúContextual Agency‚Äù ‚Äî which is to say, our ability to make choices is shaped by the context we are in.
For instance, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to read these words on your computer or smartphone if you were living 30+ years ago. The technology didn‚Äôt exist. You‚Äôd be reading on a newspaper or through some other means.
If you lived 150 years ago, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to fly across the world. That simply wasn‚Äôt an option given the situation. Thus, there are many things we take for granted, which are purely based on the situation we find ourselves.
According to Dr. Ellen Langer, a prominent Harvard psychologist:
But then, Langer takes this idea a step further by asking a key question and then providing the solution (emphasis mine):
It is our greatest responsibility to shape our individual and collective environments to match our values and ambitions. Or, as Dr. Marshall Goldmish said in his book, Triggers: Creating Behavior That Lasts ‚Äî Becoming the Person You Want to Be, ‚ÄúIf we do not create and control our environment, our environment creates and controls us.‚Äù
There is a brilliant book, Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization, Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright share their expansive research on different cultural groups in America.
They break-down ‚ÄúTribal Culture‚Äù into 5 levels, similar to how ‚ÄúIn Time‚Äù breaks-down Time Zones.
It‚Äôs important to note that the mindset and cultural values of the first three Cultural stages are highly ‚Äúindividualistic.‚Äù The emphasis is on the individual.
Me, me, me.
In order to get out of Stage 3 and into Stage 4, you need to start working with other people. As a friend of mine and near billionaire has said, ‚ÄúYou go from ‚ÄòI do it,‚Äô to ‚ÄòWe do it,‚Äô to ‚ÄòThey do it.‚Äô‚Äù
Most people never get beyond ‚ÄúI do it,‚Äù in their work. They never learn to delegate or collaborate. They have their own jobs and they get paid to do them.
Even most entrepreneurs and freelance creative people never get beyond Stage 3 thinking. Very few realize that the skills that get you out of Egypt are not the same skills that get you into the Promised Land (to use a Biblical analogy I learned from Dan Sullivan).
In other words, what got you here won‚Äôt get you there.
The thinking that got you here won‚Äôt get you there. As Albert Einstein has said, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.‚Äù Your thinking fundamentally needs to change as you upgrade environments, or else you won‚Äôt stay in those environments for long.
In the important book, The Lessons of History, famed historians Will and Ariel Durrant explain the key lessons they gleaned while studying the history of the world for several decades.
One of those key lessons is that, as a society has an increase in freedoms, they must simultaneously increase their intelligence to match the level of their freedom, or their freedom will eventually be lost.
This is one of the key themes influencing the rise and fall of nations. There is a surge of energy and enthusiasm which generally comes in the form of revolting against an existing system. There are a new law and order created and particular Stage 4 group band together and becomes a Stage 5 Phenom that changes the world.
However, according to the Durrants, when a social group experiences an intense increase of social freedoms ‚Äî wherein they have an abundance of freedom and choice ‚Äî their level of intelligence needs to increase to match their level of freedom, or else that freedom will be squandered, which is often the case.
Hence, America has a high potential of collapsing as the world superpower. The Durrants expect that the American fall will occur sometime in the next 200‚Äì300 years. However, they may not have accounted for globalization and the internet and exponential technologies.
The important point here is that, in order to thrive in a higher-level environment, your level of intelligence needs to rise to meet the new rules and demands of the higher-level environment. Otherwise, you won‚Äôt remain in that environment for long. The skills that got you out of the ghetto are not the skills that will allow you to thrive in New Grenich.
The rugged individualist mindset that got you out of the ghetto won‚Äôt get you very far among the super-wealthy, where connections and mutual trust are everything.
It‚Äôs been very interesting to observe these social principles within the walls of my own home. When we brought our beautiful children into our home, they had no comprehension of the ‚Äúrules‚Äù they needed to understand to thrive in our middle-class to upper-middle-class environment. They needed to be taught the rules. They‚Äôre still learning the rules.
And these rules aren‚Äôt meant to stamp out individuality. Rather, they are social and economic rules for not destroying themselves and going back into the ghetto, their principles for thriving and succeeding in society, in work, and with people. In other words, we attempt to teach correct principles and let them govern themselves.
At some point, it will be their choice to live what we taught them, to revert back to their native environment, or to advance beyond what we‚Äôve taught them.
Getting from one ‚ÄúTime Zone‚Äù to another isn‚Äôt necessarily easy. The movie, In Time, makes that abundantly clear.
The system isn‚Äôt set up for people to advance easily.
Social cultures make it even harder. By very nature, human beings are the social product of their environments. We develop bonds and those bonds keep us from wanting to advance ourselves and potentially destroy those bonds.
The hardest leap from one economic status to another is likely from Stage 1 to Stage 2 ‚Äî getting out of the ghettos and living from day-to-day to lower-middle-class where you‚Äôre living month-to-month.
The easiest jump is likely from Stage 2 to Stage 3 ‚Äî getting out of the victim mindset and developing a sense of responsibility for the outcomes you create in your life. One reason this isn‚Äôt that hard of a leap is that you can generally maintain the same peer and social groups, even though a disconnect will develop. You can generally get into Stage 3 by getting educated, reading some books, and having a little bit of personal ambition.
Without question, making any one of these jumps is difficult ‚Äî even going from lower-middle-class to middle-class.
The fastest way to make a jump is through proximity. You want to get yourself around people who are in higher-level systems and learn from them. You want to understand the laws and principles that generate their success. You need to understand how they operate socially. Because socially, there are fundamentally different rules at each stage for thriving. Again, the skills that got you out of Egypt will keep you stuck in the desert.
Dr. David Hawkins explains, ‚ÄúThe unconscious will only allow us to have what we believe we deserve. If we have a small view of ourselves, then what we deserve is poverty. And our unconscious will see to it that we have that actuality.‚Äù
Every culture has an embedded mindset and belief system. Hence, 95% of all behavior is unconscious and outsourced to the environment.
Your environment is the ultimate feedback loop, demonstrating where you are at the subconscious level. Your environment is a pretty accurate mirror reflecting back to you your subconscious belief system.
How you behave and treat other people is a reflection of your current situation. Different thinking, different behaviors, and relating differently to others will create a fundamentally different situation around you.
You can definitely jump from one Time Zone or Economic Status to another. However, you can never get out of one and stay in another on your own. You always need help from other people and other sources.
The most help is needed in getting people from Stage 1 to Stage 2. Radical interventions, extreme separation from family and friends, and economic help from outside parties is almost always required
Another extremely difficult leap is from Stage 3 thinking and cultures to Stage 4. In order to make this leap, you have to unlearn all of the rules that made you relatively successful in the first place. You have to put off your rugged individuality and begin thinking much, much bigger. You need to realize that individuality can actually be a poison. As Dr. David Hawkins explains in his book, LETTING GO, ‚ÄúIt is the illusion of individuality that is the origin of all suffering.‚Äù
Instead of seeing yourself as a lone individual, you recognize yourself as a single factor within a larger system. You realize that your possibilities are shaped by context and that self-made is an illusion. Rather than trying to see what you can do alone, you now recognize that you could go 100X further and faster by collaborating with other people.
According to Harvard psychologist, Robert Kegan, only 8% of the population reaches this level of ‚Äúconscious evolution,‚Äù wherein they move from an individual to a part of a collective. But not just any collective. You become a part of collaborative and synergistic groups where highly creative and innovative thinking occurs. This is where ‚Äúmission‚Äù and the desire to do real good happens ‚Äî where all parties are completely secure in their own ability to survive and take care of their base needs. Abundance, giving, creativity, gratitude, and growth are the focus of these groups.
Always learning and upgrading.
The third most difficult leap is from Stage 4 to Stage 5. This is basically going from the top 3‚Äì5% of the population to the top 1%, and more accurately, the 1% of the 1% ‚Äî Those who are the best in the world at what they do, and are the highest paid.
This is equivalent to going from college to professional athletics. It‚Äôs much easier to go from High School (Stage 3) to College (Stage 4), but much much harder going from Stage 4 to Stage 5.
Making any of these jumps is completely possible.
Perhaps the most fundamental decision any person can ever make is this one:
That is the most fundamental decision you can make about life as a human being. It is what some would call a ‚Äúwatershed issue‚Äù ‚Äî whichever side of the equation you pick will put you down a course that will influence all of your other decisions, mindsets, and beliefs.
Do you believe you can choose what you become?
Or do you believe your course is set for you at birth?
Do you ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù yourself or do you ‚Äúcreate‚Äù yourself?
You can‚Äôt change nature.... or, nature is change....Which side of the coin do you choose?
Whichever perspective you choose, your brain will go about finding any and all information it can to support that bias. As Dan Sullivan has said, ‚ÄúYour eyes can only see and your ears can only hear what your brain is looking for.‚Äù Psychologists call this ‚Äúselective attention.‚Äù
What you focus on expands.
You see what you believe is real ‚Äî and then it becomes real for you in a self-fulfilling prophecy. As Dr. Stephen Covey said, ‚ÄúYou see the world, not as it is, but as you‚Äôve been conditioned to see it.‚Äù
Making this shift starts by recognizing that for quite a while, you‚Äôve been going through the motions. Your thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and even desires are the product of your environment.
Thanks to a global world that makes information abundant, it isn‚Äôt hard to become exposed to other ways of life. However, you must realize quickly that most of the information online is complete trash. Which is why Basecamp Founder, Jason Fried, has said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty oblivious to a lot of things intentionally. I don‚Äôt want to be influenced that much.‚Äù
Once you begin upgrading your mindset and environment, and once your priorities and goals are clear ‚Äî then you don‚Äôt want to be swayed or distracted by most of the low-level information out there.
You must realize that most of the information produced is from Stage 2 and Stage 3 cultures. Therefore, if you consume that level of information, then those mindsets will be embedded into your subconscious thinking.
People in Stage 4 and Stage 5 cultures do not consume the same information as do people in Stage 2 and 3 cultures. For example, I recently spoke at a mastermind done by Bo Eason, who used to be a professional football player and is now a very highly paid public speaker.
Bo‚Äôs son, Axel, intends on being the first person to go pro in both football and basketball. Therefore, Bo doesn‚Äôt allow Axel to watch the NFL on public television. According to Bo, sports on TV is made for fans and consumers, not the players.
‚ÄúThe pro‚Äôs don‚Äôt want that crap,‚Äù Bo told me.
Pro‚Äôs study film, practice, and play the game.
When you‚Äôre a real pro, you don‚Äôt consume how fans consume. You do the work. You‚Äôre too busy creating and learning and growing and living your life.
Are you a fan or a pro?
Are you a consumer or creator?
A key strategy for making any jump is to, ‚ÄúAssume the feeling of your wish fulfilled,‚Äù meaning, you assume the posture, attitude, and emotions of the people operating at the higher level.
You affirm to yourself who you are and then operate from that affirmation. This may sound like ‚Äúacting as if,‚Äù and it actually is.
But it‚Äôs important to realize that we are always ‚Äúacting‚Äù in a role. All of life is acting. In every situation, you are assuming a character. You‚Äôre playing a role based on the other people around you. In some situations, your role may be an employee, while in others it may be a parent, or child, or friend.
In all cases, you are acting a part.
You can change your role.
You can change the stage.
You can choose to be different. But it must start in your state of being. Rather than operating subconsciously as the majority of people do, you must make a conscious decision about who you intend to be and where you intend to go. You must then BEHAVE from that decision. When you act from that decision, then you create the outcomes you are seeking. You will become the person you intend to be, rather than the person your circumstances led you to be.
I‚Äôve created a cheat sheet for putting yourself into a PEAK-STATE, immediately. You follow this daily, your life will change very quickly.
Get the cheat sheet here!

That‚Äôs how I felt.
Tucked beneath what may have been the world‚Äôs softest blanket.
I took a deep breath and rolled onto my side. It was a familiar moment ‚Äî the moment when my 6 a.m. alarm clock sounded, after a night of tossing and turning.
The moment when my daily responsibilities had yet to beckon me. The moment when the clouds of my imagination felt more real than writing lines of code.
In a few minutes, I would answer the same question I had faced every weekday for the past year:
At the time, I was working as a programmer for an NYC media company.
Balancing a full-time job with the responsibilities of scaling my startup, JotForm, taught me a lot about myself.
Among other things, I learned that I was somewhat risk-averse.
The typical path of raising venture capital wasn‚Äôt appealing to me. Additionally, as someone who highly values personal freedom, I didn‚Äôt want to make myself beholden to anyone.
This meant two things:
I want to share my experience of overcoming procrastination while scaling a side project into a company that now employs more than 130 people.
But before diving in, it might be interesting to take a look at how two types of founders handle procrastination: VC-backed founders vs bootstrappers who build their startups without any outside funding.
Bootstrappers like myself aren‚Äôt the only entrepreneurs who sometimes grapple with the snooze button.
However, VC-backed founders may have a slight psychological advantage when compared to their bootstrapping counterparts: The pressure that comes with taking someone else‚Äôs money.
But that‚Äôs not all.
VC-backed founders are motivated to ‚Äúpay investors back‚Äù sooner rather than later for another reason: Once a company has grown accustomed to a certain level of spending, scaling back becomes next to impossible.
Should the company fail to gain traction within 12 to 18 months, it could very well become another failure statistic.
Thus, the VC-backed founder who doesn‚Äôt feel like sending out emails Monday morning has every incentive to do so.
Conversely, the bootstrapper must learn how to push through procrastination ‚Äî without the motivating force of a ticking clock and a room full of unhappy investors.
I encountered this learning curve while building JotForm in 2006. It was my first year in business, and my bedroom served as the company headquarters.
While I loved what I was building ‚Äî a user-friendly form builder to help organizations enhance productivity ‚Äî the temptation to procrastinate sometimes got the best of me.
Whether it was the lull of my comfy bed or the laughter promised by a favorite TV show, my home office was riddled with distractions.
During this time, I read many books about entrepreneurship, productivity, and procrastination. Sometimes their advice worked for me, and other times it didn‚Äôt.
When I became especially curious about the topic of procrastination, I often wondered:
Through self-observation, one thing became clear: There was always a reason for my procrastination.
Whenever I noticed the urge to put something off, I tried to ask myself ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù Surely enough, my mind always answered.
Once I had identified the real problem ‚Äî that was causing the feeling of avoidance ‚Äî I could develop an appropriate plan of action to reclaim my productivity.
As simple as it sounds, identifying the root problem is somewhat contrary to common advice. The internet is filled with articles that advise us to push through feelings of resistance.
Heidi Grant, a social psychologist, and Harvard Business Review contributor, echoes this sentiment:
While I completely agree and have often written about how organizational systems can enhance productivity, I believe something extremely important is often overlooked:
‚ÄúJust do it‚Äù isn‚Äôt a sustainable solution for beating chronic procrastination. If we repeatedly find ourselves avoiding certain tasks, an underlying problem needs to be addressed.
Once we identify the real cause, we can search for the right productivity hacks and solutions to meet our needs.
Here are the most common reasons that I figured often lead us to procrastinate:
Think back to the last time you started a new project. You probably felt excited about executing that new marketing strategy, blog content idea, or programming stack.
Fast forward a couple of weeks, and you now find yourself approaching the same task with a twinge of discouragement.
Observe your procrastinating mind in action, and it‚Äôs probably saying something like: My hard work isn‚Äôt being rewarded; this isn‚Äôt fun.
Science says humans are intrinsically more motivated by instant gratification than delayed gratification. Considering that worthwhile projects are rarely built overnight, this tendency is annoyingly inconvenient. The solution?
Stanford University behavioral scientist and lecturer BJ Fogg recommends creating systematic behavioral changes that correspond with ‚Äúsmall wins.‚Äù
In other words, create your own way to celebrate small milestones. According to Fogg, every task should be accompanied by ‚Äúa trigger‚Äù ‚Äî and the easier the action better.
Say you‚Äôre committed to writing content for your new website. You might make an agreement with yourself to write one paragraph after each time you use the restroom, and continue to follow this trigger throughout the day.
Once you‚Äôve completed the task, Fogg urges you to celebrate in a predetermined manner. The celebration could be as simple as treating yourself to a piece of chewing gum or as active as taking a bike ride through a favorite part of town.
Treat the series of actions like a game:
Why does this work? Creating small wins provides an incentive to keep working toward the finish line. Eventually, the actions create a habit that may become enjoyable.
Another common reason for procrastination? Having so much to do that we‚Äôre not sure where to begin.
During the early days of building JotForm, I wasn‚Äôt always sure what to work on. With seemingly endless tasks begging for my attention, I often ended up ‚Äúprocrastinating‚Äù with low-value activities.
Based on my conversations with other founders, I know my experience was far from unique. A lack of organizational systems leads to unnecessary feelings of overwhelm, confusion and avoidance.
Here‚Äôs the key:
The more systems we put in place, the less we find ourselves procrastinating. I‚Äôm reminded of the importance of this each year when I visit my family. They own a small olive farm that runs like a well-oiled machine.
Everyone knows what needs to happen first, second and third when we harvest the fruit. With no room for guesswork, procrastination is virtually non-existent.
This is the unofficial mantra of Silicon Valley tech founders.
However, look beneath the surface, and a different image will emerge: ambitious entrepreneurs who are terrified of making a bad decision.
As one anonymous insider shared with management consultant and Forbes contributor Rob Asghar:
While some founders cope by taking shortcuts, others stall out due to perfectionism. The tendency shows up in the form of delayed launch dates, missed deadlines, and ‚Äúproductive procrastination.‚Äù
During the early days, it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for me to spend a ridiculous amount of time on tasks that didn‚Äôt really matter.
Meanwhile, I was missing out on opportunities to grow our customer base, forge business partnerships, and help even more organizations enhance their productivity with user-friendly forms.
This was another reason I made the controversial decision to forego venture capital. I knew the pressure of a board looking over my shoulder would clash with my inner perfectionist.
Does that mean I never procrastinated for fear of failure? No ‚Äî but I could be gentle with myself when it happened.
Hendrickson recommends that we should consistently remind ourselves of the crucial difference between who we are and what we achieve.
Easier said than done, but it‚Äôs sound advice.
Surprise, surprise ‚Äî the most common reason for procrastination may actually be disliking the task at hand.
It‚Äôs no secret that building a business involves several moving parts. Understandably, everyone enjoys some tasks more than others.
One person may have an affinity for cold email campaigns, while another would rather play in traffic.
In such instances, HBR contributor Heidi Grant recommends using something she calls ‚Äúif-then planning.‚Äù The process involves identifying the specific steps needed to complete a task and ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî where and when you will do it.
For example: If it‚Äôs 11 a.m. then I will stop what I‚Äôm doing and cold email prospects.
Grant claims the process is different than relying on sheer willpower alone.
Personally, I find it more effective to ask targeted questions:
Once I reconnect with my goals and remind myself of the potential outcomes, I‚Äôm back on track. Obviously, there is no ‚Äúright way‚Äù to deal with procrastination.
These are just some of the methods that have worked for me over the years. Everyone has unique personality quirks, internal motivations, and reasons for procrastinating.
Translation: The newest productivity hack everyone is raving about may not work for you. And that‚Äôs okay.
Identify your personal reasons for procrastinating, apply the best-suited advice and ignore the rest.
Oh, and do your best not to hit snooze ‚Äî no matter how cozy your bed might feel.

And how to make it a habit

Somebody once asked Warren Buffett about his secret to success. Buffett pointed to a stack of books and said,
When I first found this quote of Buffett‚Äôs two years ago, something was wrong.
It was December 2014. I‚Äôd found my dream job. Some days, I would be there, sitting at my dream job, and I would think. My god, what if I‚Äôm still here in 40 years? I don‚Äôt want to die like this...
Something wasn‚Äôt right. I‚Äôd followed the prescription: Good grades. Leadership. Recommendations. College. Dream job. I was a winner. I‚Äôd finished the race. Here I was in the land of dreams. But something was terribly, terribly wrong.
In January of 2015, I found Buffett‚Äôs quote. I decided to read. I was going to read and read and read and never stop until I got some damn answers.
I didn‚Äôt quite make 500 pages a day, but, in these last two years, I‚Äôve read over 400 books, cover to cover. That decision to start reading was one of the most important decisions in my life.
Books gave me the courage to travel. Books gave me the conviction to quit my job. Books gave me role models and heroes and meaning in a world where I had none.
I want to say reading 200 books a year is an amazing thing. But the truth is, it‚Äôs not. Anybody can do it.
All it takes is some simple math and the right tools.
When the average Joe hears the advice ‚ÄúRead 500 pages every day,‚Äù his snap reaction is, ‚ÄúNo way! That‚Äôs impossible!‚Äù
Joe will then go on to make up reasons to justify his belief without doing any deep thinking at all. These might include ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too busy,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not smart enough,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBooks just aren‚Äôt for me.‚Äù
But what if we go a little deeper? For example, what does it actually take to read 200 books a year? Before I began this project two years ago, I stopped to do the math. Here‚Äôs what I found: Reading 200 books a year isn‚Äôt hard at all.
It‚Äôs just like Buffett says. Anyone can do it, but most people won‚Äôt.
How long does it take to read 200 books a year?
First, let‚Äôs look at two quick statistics:
Now, all we need are some quick calculations...
That‚Äôs all there is to it. To read 200 books, simply spend 417 hours a year reading.
I know, I know. If your brain is like mine, it probably saw ‚Äú417 hours‚Äù and immediately tried to shut off. Most people only work 40 hours a week! How can we possibly read for 417 hours?
I mean, 417 hours sure feels like a lot. But is it, really? Let‚Äôs try to get some more perspective.
Here‚Äôs how much time the average American spends on social media and TV in a year:
Wow. That‚Äôs 3442.5 hours a year spent on TRASH. If those hours were spent reading instead, you could be reading over 1600 books a year!
Here‚Äôs the simple truth behind reading a lot of books: It‚Äôs not that hard. We have all the time we need. The scary part ‚Äî the part we all ignore ‚Äî is that we are too addicted, too weak, and too distracted to do what we all know is important.
All it takes to start reading more is to take ‚Äúempty time‚Äù spent Twitter-stalking celebrities or watching Desperate Housewives and convert some of it to reading time.
The theory is simple. It‚Äôs the execution that‚Äôs hard.
We all know reading is important. We all know we should do more of it. But we don‚Äôt. The main reason this happens is a failure to execute.
I‚Äôm not so perfect at it yet, but here are some tactics that have helped me get results.
If you were quitting cocaine, would you keep it lying around the house? Of course not. Media is designed to be addictive. Moving away from media addiction can be as difficult as quitting drugs.
The biggest bang-for-buck changes here are environmental.
If you want to read, make sure (1) you remove all distractions from your environment and (2) you make books as easy to access as possible.
As an example, here‚Äôs my immediate environment:
I travel a lot. That doesn‚Äôt stop me from reading. The picture on the left is of my ‚Äúbookshelf‚Äù in Thailand. I try to keep books everywhere so I can just pick one up and start reading.
The picture on the right is my smartphone desktop. Notice there are only two apps. One of them ‚Äî the Kindle app ‚Äî is for reading. The other is for habits... Which brings me to my next point.
Willpower is not a good tool for lifestyle change. It always fails you when you need it most. Instead of relying on strength of mind, build a fortress of habits ‚Äî these are what will keep you resilient in tough times.
If you‚Äôre not familiar with habit science, my favorite book on the subject is Tynan‚Äôs Superhuman by Habit. It‚Äôs infinitely practical, and practical is all I care about.
Getting good at habit-forming took me years. Many of the mistakes I made were avoidable. If I could go back, I‚Äôd find a habit coach. Here‚Äôs how I see it. One game-changing idea from a good book is worth thousands of dollars. If a coach helps you read ONE more good book a year, you already get your money‚Äôs worth. (A shout out to Cherry Jeffs and Nathan Sudds, two coaches that have helped me out a lot.)
When it comes to reading, be a jack of all trades, not a specialist.
If your goal is to read more, you can‚Äôt be picky about where you read or what mediums you use. I read paper books. I read on my phone. I listen to audiobooks. And I do these things everywhere ‚Äî on park benches, in buses, on the toilet... wherever I can.
Make your reading opportunistic. If you have a chance, take it. If you don‚Äôt have a chance, find one.
If I hadn‚Äôt started reading, perhaps I‚Äôd still be at my dream job. Perhaps I‚Äôd still be at my desk, taking peeks at the clock and wondering if that was how I was going to die.
If you‚Äôre in a similar position, give reading a try. You may find much, much more than you were looking for.

Right? Why else go through all the pain and hardship? It‚Äôs to achieve happiness in some way.
And I‚Äôm not the only person who believed that. In fact, if you look around you, most people are pursuing happiness in their lives.
That‚Äôs why we collectively buy shit we don‚Äôt need, go to bed with people we don‚Äôt love, and try to work hard to get approval of people we don‚Äôt like.
Why do we do these things? To be honest, I don‚Äôt care what the exact reason is. I‚Äôm not a scientist. All I know is that it has something to do with history, culture, media, economy, psychology, politics, the information era, and you name it. The list is endless.
Let‚Äôs just accept that. Most people love to analyze why people are not happy or don‚Äôt live fulfilling lives. I don‚Äôt necessarily care about the why.
I care more about how we can change.
Just a few short years ago, I did everything to chase happiness.
But at the end of the day, you‚Äôre lying in your bed (alone or next to your spouse), and you think: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next in this endless pursuit of happiness?‚Äù
Well, I can tell you what‚Äôs next: You, chasing something random that you believe makes you happy.
It‚Äôs all a facÃßade. A hoax. A story that‚Äôs been made up.
Did Aristotle lie to us when he said:
I think we have to look at that quote from a different angle. Because when you read it, you think that happiness is the main goal. And that‚Äôs kind of what the quote says as well.
Happiness can‚Äôt be a goal in itself. Therefore, it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs achievable.
I believe that happiness is merely a byproduct of usefulness.
When I talk about this concept with friends, family, and colleagues, I always find it difficult to put this into words. But I‚Äôll give it a try here.
Most things we do in life are just activities and experiences.
Those things should make you happy, right? But they are not useful. You‚Äôre not creating anything. You‚Äôre just consuming or doing something. And that‚Äôs great.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I love to go on holiday, or go shopping sometimes. But to be honest, it‚Äôs not what gives meaning to life.
What really makes me happy is when I‚Äôm useful. When I create something that others can use. Or even when I create something I can use.
For the longest time I found it difficult to explain the concept of usefulness and happiness. But when I recently ran into a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, the dots finally connected.
Emerson says:
And I didn‚Äôt get that before I became more conscious of what I‚Äôm doing with my life. And that always sounds heavy and all. But it‚Äôs actually really simple.
Did you do useful things in your lifetime? You don‚Äôt have to change the world or anything. Just make it a little bit better than before you were born.
If you don‚Äôt know how, here are some ideas.
That‚Äôs just some stuff I like to do. You can make up your own useful activities.
You see? It‚Äôs not anything big. But when you do little useful things every day, it adds up to a life that is well lived. A life that mattered.
The last thing I want is to be on my deathbed and realize there‚Äôs zero evidence that I ever existed.
Recently I read Not Fade Away by Laurence Shames and Peter Barton. It‚Äôs about Peter Barton, the founder of Liberty Media, who shares his thoughts about dying from cancer.
It‚Äôs a very powerful book and it will definitely bring tears to your eyes. In the book, he writes about how he lived his life and how he found his calling. He also went to business school, and this is what he thought of his fellow MBA candidates:
You can say that about all of us. And after he realized that in his thirties, he founded a company that turned him into a multi-millionaire.
Another person who always makes himself useful is Casey Neistat. I‚Äôve been following him for a year and a half now, and every time I watch his YouTube show, he‚Äôs doing something.
He also talks about how he always wants to do and create something. He even has a tattoo on his forearm that says ‚ÄúDo More.‚Äù
Most people would say, ‚Äúwhy would you work more?‚Äù And then they turn on Netflix and watch back to back episodes of Daredevil.
Being useful is a mindset. And like with any mindset, it starts with a decision. One day I woke up and thought to myself: What am I doing for this world? The answer was nothing.
And that same day I started writing. For you it can be painting, creating a product, helping elderly, or anything you feel like doing.
Don‚Äôt take it too seriously. Don‚Äôt overthink it. Just DO something that‚Äôs useful. Anything.

I‚Äôm an expert on how technology hijacks our psychological vulnerabilities. That‚Äôs why I spent the last three years as a Design Ethicist at Google caring about how to design things in a way that defends a billion people‚Äôs minds from getting hijacked.
When using technology, we often focus optimistically on all the things it does for us. But I want to show you where it might do the opposite.
Where does technology exploit our minds‚Äô weaknesses?
I learned to think this way when I was a magician. Magicians start by looking for blind spots, edges, vulnerabilities and limits of people‚Äôs perception, so they can influence what people do without them even realizing it. Once you know how to push people‚Äôs buttons, you can play them like a piano.
And this is exactly what product designers do to your mind. They play your psychological vulnerabilities (consciously and unconsciously) against you in the race to grab your attention.
I want to show you how they do it.
Western Culture is built around ideals of individual choice and freedom. Millions of us fiercely defend our right to make ‚Äúfree‚Äù choices, while we ignore how those choices are manipulated upstream by menus we didn‚Äôt choose in the first place.
This is exactly what magicians do. They give people the illusion of free choice while architecting the menu so that they win, no matter what you choose. I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how deep this insight is.
When people are given a menu of choices, they rarely ask:
For example, imagine you‚Äôre out with friends on a Tuesday night and want to keep the conversation going. You open Yelp to find nearby recommendations and see a list of bars. The group turns into a huddle of faces staring down at their phones comparing bars. They scrutinize the photos of each, comparing cocktail drinks. Is this menu still relevant to the original desire of the group?
It‚Äôs not that bars aren‚Äôt a good choice, it‚Äôs that Yelp substituted the group‚Äôs original question (‚Äúwhere can we go to keep talking?‚Äù) with a different question (‚Äúwhat‚Äôs a bar with good photos of cocktails?‚Äù) all by shaping the menu.
Moreover, the group falls for the illusion that Yelp‚Äôs menu represents a complete set of choices for where to go. While looking down at their phones, they don‚Äôt see the park across the street with a band playing live music. They miss the pop-up gallery on the other side of the street serving crepes and coffee. Neither of those show up on Yelp‚Äôs menu.
The more choices technology gives us in nearly every domain of our lives (information, events, places to go, friends, dating, jobs) ‚Äî the more we assume that our phone is always the most empowering and useful menu to pick from. Is it?
The ‚Äúmost empowering‚Äù menu is different than the menu that has the most choices. But when we blindly surrender to the menus we‚Äôre given, it‚Äôs easy to lose track of the difference:
When we wake up in the morning and turn our phone over to see a list of notifications ‚Äî it frames the experience of ‚Äúwaking up in the morning‚Äù around a menu of ‚Äúall the things I‚Äôve missed since yesterday.‚Äù (for more examples, see Joe Edelman‚Äôs Empowering Design talk)
By shaping the menus we pick from, technology hijacks the way we perceive our choices and replaces them with new ones. But the closer we pay attention to the options we‚Äôre given, the more we‚Äôll notice when they don‚Äôt actually align with our true needs.
If you‚Äôre an app, how do you keep people hooked? Turn yourself into a slot machine.
The average person checks their phone 150 times a day. Why do we do this? Are we making 150 conscious choices?
One major reason why is the #1 psychological ingredient in slot machines: intermittent variable rewards.
If you want to maximize addictiveness, all tech designers need to do is link a user‚Äôs action (like pulling a lever) with a variable reward. You pull a lever and immediately receive either an enticing reward (a match, a prize!) or nothing. Addictiveness is maximized when the rate of reward is most variable.
Does this effect really work on people? Yes. Slot machines make more money in the United States than baseball, movies, and theme parks combined. Relative to other kinds of gambling, people get ‚Äòproblematically involved‚Äô with slot machines 3‚Äì4x faster according to NYU professor Natasha Dow Schull, author of Addiction by Design.
But here‚Äôs the unfortunate truth ‚Äî several billion people have a slot machine their pocket:
Apps and websites sprinkle intermittent variable rewards all over their products because it‚Äôs good for business.
But in other cases, slot machines emerge by accident. For example, there is no malicious corporation behind all of email who consciously chose to make it a slot machine. No one profits when millions check their email and nothing‚Äôs there. Neither did Apple and Google‚Äôs designers want phones to work like slot machines. It emerged by accident.
But now companies like Apple and Google have a responsibility to reduce these effects by converting intermittent variable rewards into less addictive, more predictable ones with better design. For example, they could empower people to set predictable times during the day or week for when they want to check ‚Äúslot machine‚Äù apps, and correspondingly adjust when new messages are delivered to align with those times.
Another way apps and websites hijack people‚Äôs minds is by inducing a ‚Äú1% chance you could be missing something important.‚Äù
If I convince you that I‚Äôm a channel for important information, messages, friendships, or potential sexual opportunities ‚Äî it will be hard for you to turn me off, unsubscribe, or remove your account ‚Äî because (aha, I win) you might miss something important:
But if we zoom into that fear, we‚Äôll discover that it‚Äôs unbounded: we‚Äôll always miss something important at any point when we stop using something.
But living moment to moment with the fear of missing something isn‚Äôt how we‚Äôre built to live.
And it‚Äôs amazing how quickly, once we let go of that fear, we wake up from the illusion. When we unplug for more than a day, unsubscribe from those notifications, or go to Camp Grounded ‚Äî the concerns we thought we‚Äôd have don‚Äôt actually happen.
We don‚Äôt miss what we don‚Äôt see.
The thought, ‚Äúwhat if I miss something important?‚Äù is generated in advance of unplugging, unsubscribing, or turning off ‚Äî not after. Imagine if tech companies recognized that, and helped us proactively tune our relationships with friends and businesses in terms of what we define as ‚Äútime well spent‚Äù for our lives, instead of in terms of what we might miss.
We‚Äôre all vulnerable to social approval. The need to belong, to be approved or appreciated by our peers is among the highest human motivations. But now our social approval is in the hands of tech companies.
When I get tagged by my friend Marc, I imagine him making a conscious choice to tag me. But I don‚Äôt see how a company like Facebook orchestrated his doing that in the first place.
Facebook, Instagram or SnapChat can manipulate how often people get tagged in photos by automatically suggesting all the faces people should tag (e.g. by showing a box with a 1-click confirmation, ‚ÄúTag Tristan in this photo?‚Äù).
So when Marc tags me, he‚Äôs actually responding to Facebook‚Äôs suggestion, not making an independent choice. But through design choices like this, Facebook controls the multiplier for how often millions of people experience their social approval on the line.
The same happens when we change our main profile photo ‚Äî Facebook knows that‚Äôs a moment when we‚Äôre vulnerable to social approval: ‚Äúwhat do my friends think of my new pic?‚Äù Facebook can rank this higher in the news feed, so it sticks around for longer and more friends will like or comment on it. Each time they like or comment on it, we‚Äôll get pulled right back.
Everyone innately responds to social approval, but some demographics (teenagers) are more vulnerable to it than others. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to recognize how powerful designers are when they exploit this vulnerability.
We are vulnerable to needing to reciprocate others‚Äô gestures. But as with Social Approval, tech companies now manipulate how often we experience it.
In some cases, it‚Äôs by accident. Email, texting and messaging apps are social reciprocity factories. But in other cases, companies exploit this vulnerability on purpose.
LinkedIn is the most obvious offender. LinkedIn wants as many people creating social obligations for each other as possible, because each time they reciprocate (by accepting a connection, responding to a message, or endorsing someone back for a skill) they have to come back to linkedin.com where they can get people to spend more time.
Like Facebook, LinkedIn exploits an asymmetry in perception. When you receive an invitation from someone to connect, you imagine that person making a conscious choice to invite you, when in reality, they likely unconsciously responded to LinkedIn‚Äôs list of suggested contacts. In other words, LinkedIn turns your unconscious impulses (to ‚Äúadd‚Äù a person) into new social obligations that millions of people feel obligated to repay. All while they profit from the time people spend doing it.
Imagine millions of people getting interrupted like this throughout their day, running around like chickens with their heads cut off, reciprocating each other ‚Äî all designed by companies who profit from it.
Welcome to social media.
Imagine if technology companies had a responsibility to minimize social reciprocity. Or if there was an independent organization that represented the public‚Äôs interests ‚Äî an industry consortium or an FDA for tech ‚Äî that monitored when technology companies abused these biases?
Another way to hijack people is to keep them consuming things, even when they aren‚Äôt hungry anymore.
How? Easy. Take an experience that was bounded and finite, and turn it into a bottomless flow that keeps going.
Cornell professor Brian Wansink demonstrated this in his study showing you can trick people into keep eating soup by giving them a bottomless bowl that automatically refills as they eat. With bottomless bowls, people eat 73% more calories than those with normal bowls and underestimate how many calories they ate by 140 calories.
Tech companies exploit the same principle. News feeds are purposely designed to auto-refill with reasons to keep you scrolling, and purposely eliminate any reason for you to pause, reconsider or leave.
It‚Äôs also why video and social media sites like Netflix, YouTube or Facebook autoplay the next video after a countdown instead of waiting for you to make a conscious choice (in case you won‚Äôt). A huge portion of traffic on these websites is driven by autoplaying the next thing.
Tech companies often claim that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre just making it easier for users to see the video they want to watch‚Äù when they are actually serving their business interests. And you can‚Äôt blame them, because increasing ‚Äútime spent‚Äù is the currency they compete for.
Instead, imagine if technology companies empowered you to consciously bound your experience to align with what would be ‚Äútime well spent‚Äù for you. Not just bounding the quantity of time you spend, but the qualities of what would be ‚Äútime well spent.‚Äù
Companies know that messages that interrupt people immediately are more persuasive at getting people to respond than messages delivered asynchronously (like email or any deferred inbox).
Given the choice, Facebook Messenger (or WhatsApp, WeChat or SnapChat for that matter) would prefer to design their messaging system to interrupt recipients immediately (and show a chat box) instead of helping users respect each other‚Äôs attention.
In other words, interruption is good for business.
It‚Äôs also in their interest to heighten the feeling of urgency and social reciprocity. For example, Facebook automatically tells the sender when you ‚Äúsaw‚Äù their message, instead of letting you avoid disclosing whether you read it (‚Äúnow that you know I‚Äôve seen the message, I feel even more obligated to respond.‚Äù)
By contrast, Apple more respectfully lets users toggle ‚ÄúRead Receipts‚Äù on or off.
The problem is, maximizing interruptions in the name of business creates a tragedy of the commons, ruining global attention spans and causing billions of unnecessary interruptions each day. This is a huge problem we need to fix with shared design standards (potentially, as part of Time Well Spent).
Another way apps hijack you is by taking your reasons for visiting the app (to perform a task) and make them inseparable from the app‚Äôs business reasons (maximizing how much we consume once we‚Äôre there).
For example, in the physical world of grocery stores, the #1 and #2 most popular reasons to visit are pharmacy refills and buying milk. But grocery stores want to maximize how much people buy, so they put the pharmacy and the milk at the back of the store.
In other words, they make the thing customers want (milk, pharmacy) inseparable from what the business wants. If stores were truly organized to support people, they would put the most popular items in the front.
Tech companies design their websites the same way. For example, when you you want to look up a Facebook event happening tonight (your reason) the Facebook app doesn‚Äôt allow you to access it without first landing on the news feed (their reasons), and that‚Äôs on purpose. Facebook wants to convert every reason you have for using Facebook, into their reason which is to maximize the time you spend consuming things.
Instead, imagine if ...
In a Time Well Spent world, there is always a direct way to get what you want separately from what businesses want. Imagine a digital ‚Äúbill of rights‚Äù outlining design standards that forced the products used by billions of people to let them navigate directly to what they want without needing to go through intentionally placed distractions.
We‚Äôre told that it‚Äôs enough for businesses to ‚Äúmake choices available.‚Äù
Businesses naturally want to make the choices they want you to make easier, and the choices they don‚Äôt want you to make harder. Magicians do the same thing. You make it easier for a spectator to pick the thing you want them to pick, and harder to pick the thing you don‚Äôt.
For example, NYTimes.com lets you ‚Äúmake a free choice‚Äù to cancel your digital subscription. But instead of just doing it when you hit ‚ÄúCancel Subscription,‚Äù they send you an email with information on how to cancel your account by calling a phone number that‚Äôs only open at certain times.
Instead of viewing the world in terms of availability of choices, we should view the world in terms of friction required to enact choices. Imagine a world where choices were labeled with how difficult they were to fulfill (like coefficients of friction) and there was an independent entity ‚Äî an industry consortium or non-profit ‚Äî that labeled these difficulties and set standards for how easy navigation should be.
Lastly, apps can exploit people‚Äôs inability to forecast the consequences of a click.
People don‚Äôt intuitively forecast the true cost of a click when it‚Äôs presented to them. Sales people use ‚Äúfoot in the door‚Äù techniques by asking for a small innocuous request to begin with (‚Äújust one click to see which tweet got retweeted‚Äù) and escalate from there (‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you stay awhile?‚Äù). Virtually all engagement websites use this trick.
Imagine if web browsers and smartphones, the gateways through which people make these choices, were truly watching out for people and helped them forecast the consequences of clicks (based on real data about what benefits and costs it actually had?).
That‚Äôs why I add ‚ÄúEstimated reading time‚Äù to the top of my posts. When you put the ‚Äútrue cost‚Äù of a choice in front of people, you‚Äôre treating your users or audience with dignity and respect. In a Time Well Spent internet, choices could be framed in terms of projected cost and benefit, so people were empowered to make informed choices by default, not by doing extra work.
Are you upset that technology hijacks your agency? I am too. I‚Äôve listed a few techniques but there are literally thousands. Imagine whole bookshelves, seminars, workshops and trainings that teach aspiring tech entrepreneurs techniques like these. Imagine hundreds of engineers whose job every day is to invent new ways to keep you hooked.
The ultimate freedom is a free mind, and we need technology that‚Äôs on our team to help us live, feel, think and act freely.
We need our smartphones, notifications screens and web browsers to be exoskeletons for our minds and interpersonal relationships that put our values, not our impulses, first. People‚Äôs time is valuable. And we should protect it with the same rigor as privacy and other digital rights.

We focus on what we believe we lack. And we judge our own setbacks much more harshly than we would judge others‚Äô challenges.
Even worse, ruminating on perceived shortcomings drains valuable energy that could be used more productively.
It‚Äôs not always easy to treat ourselves with kindness, understanding, and empathy, though.
When people ask me how I‚Äôve built my startup to 4.2 million users, they want me to talk about passion or how much I love what I‚Äôm doing.
The truth is I‚Äôve often been my own worst critic across this journey which has been full of ups and downs. And I‚Äôve learned that cultivating self-compassion takes time. It took me 12 years.
Self-compassion is an attitude we can all learn. And it‚Äôs also an attitude that I want to model for my teams at JotForm.
I wanted to share a few thoughts on what ‚Äúself-compassion‚Äù means, and how we can actually cultivate more kindness toward ourselves.
While self-esteem is a positive emotion we feel toward ourselves, especially when things are going well, self-compassion is about being kind to ourselves at all times ‚Äî even when we fail.
Dr. Kristin Neff, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin, and an expert on self-compassion, says that people with high levels of self-compassion exhibit three important behaviors:
Imagine it‚Äôs your turn to present a monthly report. Just before the meeting begins, your nerves start to creep in. You stumble through your notes, skip key pages, and you can feel the group‚Äôs attention slipping away with every minute.
In the end, it wasn‚Äôt your best performance.
Rather than beating yourself up in a cycle of negative thinking, self-compassion promotes a more understanding reaction.
Sure, you feel a little down, but the experience doesn‚Äôt shatter the rest of your day ‚Äî or your month. You simply acknowledge that everyone struggles sometimes.
Though a healthy dose of self-esteem never hurts, studies show that self-compassion is even more beneficial for well-being and performance. It‚Äôs also far more than a ‚Äútouchy-feely‚Äù response to challenges, both big and small.
Developing self-compassion has many potential benefits for our professional lives.
People with self-compassion typically have a ‚Äúgrowth mindset.‚Äù When they experience a failure or setback, they focus on their ability to grow and improve, rather than giving up.
That‚Äôs because people with a growth mindset see traits and abilities as malleable. They know, for example, that they can learn from something like a botched presentation.
On a related note, self-compassion helps people to be more resilient.
In a powerful study on self-compassion, Dr. Neff and her colleagues worked with U.S. veterans to test their resilience after returning from war. Using a 26-item questionnaire, the researchers rated subjects‚Äô level of self-compassion. The study concluded that the more self-compassionate veterans were, the less severe their PTSD symptoms were.
As Dr. Neff told the New York Times,
Self-compassionate people are better at owning up to their mistakes, too.
When researchers at UC Berkeley measured how self-compassion affects personal growth, they found that people who had just completed a self-compassion exercise were more motivated to admit and apologize for their mistakes than those who had done self-esteem or positive distraction exercises.
The self-compassion group was also more committed to avoid repeating their mistakes.
Empathetic managers also create stronger connections with their employees.
When self-compassionate leaders have the growth mindset I mentioned earlier, it extends to their employees, too. They‚Äôre more invested in team development and typically offer constructive feedback to help employees can improve.
When leaders care about progress, it motivates everyone to improve ‚Äî and hopefully, to exceed the expectations we set.
Self-compassion can also be increasingly beneficial as your career unfolds.
People with self-compassion often stay true to themselves, because they care more about doing fulfilling work than chasing social approval.
This authenticity pushes them to pursue roles that fit their passions and personalities.
According to Harvard researchers, ‚ÄúExpressing empathy produces physiological effects that calm us at the moment and strengthen our long-term sustainability.‚Äù These physical benefits prevent the kind of burnout and health risks associated with chronic stress.
In terms of mental wellbeing, self-compassion has many of the same benefits as self-esteem: less depression, more optimism, greater happiness, and more life satisfaction.
As we all know: happier workers are better, more productive workers.
As I mentioned earlier, cultivating self-compassion takes time. I always think of it as a muscle that must be exercised day in and out, with full control.
According to Dr. Neff, there are three components of self-compassion: mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness.
1 Mindfulness means being aware of the here and now. And in difficult situations, it means being aware of your suffering, rather than ignoring your pain.
Before we treat ourselves with compassion, we have to understand what we‚Äôre feeling ‚Äî the pain, the discomfort, the shame ‚Äî and what situation or event is causing those feelings.
Once you quiet your mind and acknowledge what you‚Äôre feeling, you give yourself the emotional space required to move forward.
2 Acknowledging our common humanity means reminding yourself that we‚Äôre all human. We all suffer, and others would likely feel the same in your situation. We all make mistakes. Instead of feeling ashamed of that presentation blip, remind yourself that it happens to everyone at times, and it‚Äôs normal to feel a little embarrassed. Then, allow yourself to move on.
3 Self-kindness means having a warm-hearted response to yourself. If the presentation didn‚Äôt go well, don‚Äôt beat yourself up. Don‚Äôt be more judgmental of yourself than you would be of others. Quiet the overly-critical inner voice, and instead, try speaking to yourself the same way you would a friend.
Dr. Neff even suggests treating yourself to a small act of kindness, such as drinking a soothing cup of tea or listening to music.
Finally, one small trick that can be incredibly powerful after a setback: write yourself a letter in the third person, as if you were a friend. List your accomplishments and your most enduring positive qualities.
This process can help give you the perspective and reassurance you need to bounce back, and to avoid getting KO‚Äôd after a minor blow.
In today‚Äôs competitive workforce, self-compassion is an underrated virtue.
By actively practicing the three components of self-compassion, however, we can all develop a more compassionate relationship with ourselves ‚Äî and those around us.
It‚Äôs difficult to rewrite your inner monologues. When something goes wrong, that critical voice inside can get louder. It‚Äôs especially common for high-achievers; people who set lofty goals high and expect a lot from themselves.
But once we learn to tell ourselves a new story, one that focuses on our common humanity, we can reshape how we react to setbacks.
Like the penguin, we can stop dwelling on the negative and free ourselves to live happier, more productive lives.

New month resolutions, 90 day years, or daily themes help you get over analysis paralysis of making big life decisions.
‚ÄúI like pushing myself to the limit and pushing the envelope, and in my mind, that is not really compatible with a reliable long-term plan,‚Äù says Tim Ferriss. ‚ÄúI generally treat my life as six-month projects and two-week experiments of various types. Then I take the most attractive door that pops up, and rinse and repeat.‚Äù
Todd Herman recommends picking a 90 Day theme.
You can also commit to monthly challenges like 1) no movies, 2) daily meditation, 3) quit social media, 4) read daily for 30 mins.
Action steps:
You have a lot less time than you think, and you‚Äôre not spending it the way you think you are.
Create an hour-by-hour log to see where your time is spent over a week and you'll be shocked with results.
When Drew Houston (founder of Dropbox) did this exercise he was stunned to discover that 1) his jar was mostly filled with sand and 2) really important rocks were falling on the ground.
When you view your life as a laboratory and start to consistently track and review your activities, you will naturally optimize how you do things.
What gets measured, gets improved.
Action steps:
It's OK to have a bad day, it's not OK to have a bad week.
Figure out what makes you unique.
By learning how your machine works you can gain a tremendous edge.
When you focus on your weaknesses, everything seems like hard work. When you follow your natural strengths, work becomes a challenging play.
Take time to discover your innate abilities, blind spots, and personality traits. If you've never done it before, it will be a transforming experience (it was for me).
Action steps:
Whether you own a business or not, you're a marketer. If you want to get others to say YES to you, you must understand what makes people tick.
Brendon Burchard recommends all his clients, even his Olympic athletes, to take at least two sales courses each year and two social psychology courses.
Russell Brunson said all his millionaire mastermind members are OBSESSED with marketing. There is a reason why many successful business owners recommend Cialdini's book ‚ÄúInfluence‚Äù (and not some business book).
So get obsessed about understanding fundamental human nature, psychology, and persuasion. It will change your life.
Action steps:
Successful people are cautious about their relationship with technology.
Technology allows us to do amazing things, but we have become addicted to it.
Yuval Noah Harari says, ‚ÄúIf you are not careful, technology will start dictating your aims and enslaving you to it‚Äôs agenda [...]
We are not living in the era of hacking computers ‚Äî we are living in the era of hacking humans. Once the corporations and governments know you better than you know yourself, they could control and manipulate you and you won‚Äôt even realize it.‚Äù
Neil Strauss, for example, blocks his computer from Internet access for 22h a day (with app Freedom) and has a timed safe, where he can drop his phone into.
It‚Äôs time for you to take back control.
Action steps:
When people hear the word ‚Äúconstraint‚Äù they think of it as a negative. But in truth, it's a powerful force for good.
A constraint is where you extremely limit yourself in one field so you can be extremely creative in another.
Few examples:
Why? Because successful people know that mental energy is in limited quantity.
You can also create constraints in your work. For example, if you're a writer you could commit to only writing and mastering 3,000-word list post.
Action steps:
Few ideas: Create a weekly meal plan. Create themes for days of the week. Read this for more ideas.
Successful people spend a lot of time thinking about problems before jumping to fix them. They figure out the lead domino that would kick off all the others in one fell swoop.
Dwight D. Eisenhower has been credited as the most productive and effective president the US ever had. Using Eisenhower Matrix you can shift from being busy to becoming effective.
The core idea is that you should spend as much time as possible doing Important / Non-Urgent things, instead of putting off fires (Urgent / Important).
Action steps:
The idea of deliberate practice is often confused with just working hard.
Musicians and athletes know this naturally. They separate playing from practicing. For some reason, knowledge workers forget this. But growth doesn't just magically happen.
Michael Simmons talks about 5-hour rule. You need to learn 5 hours a week just to stay relevant.
But proactive training regimen must be developed if you want to get ahead.
Cal Newport has said, ‚ÄúDoing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that‚Äôs exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands....‚Äù
Action steps:
‚ÄúWhat am I going to do with my life?‚Äù
Don't you get anxious just thinking about that question?
Successful people are incredibly patient in long-term, but they don't waste their days worrying about years.
While you are busy asking yourself existential questions and then procrastinate watching Netflix, successful people are in the trenches figuring things out as they go.
‚ÄúThey say:‚ÄùThink Big! Have a compelling vision!‚Äù I say: Think Small. Do something super cool by the end of the day. Excellence is the next five minutes or nothing at all. It‚Äôs the quality of your next five-minute conversation. It‚Äôs the quality of, yes, your next email.‚Äú ‚Äî Tom Peters
You don't have to figure everything out now. Just be clear about what you would like to happen today and give it your best.
Action step
Don't overthink. Just pick something where you love the process, has good income potential and go do that.
But what if it's the wrong direction? ‚Äî you may ask.
You'll find out sooner. üòä
The most valuable career skill is public speaking, some would argue.
But what‚Äôs public speaking? It‚Äôs just words that impact people.
‚ÄúMore and more communication is written today,‚Äù said Jason Fried.‚ÄúGet great at presenting yourself with words, and words alone, and you‚Äôll be far ahead of most.‚Äú
After you've studied marketing from #4, with copywriting you learn how to put that knowledge in words.
Action steps:
Have you noticed?
The more time you have to complete a task, the more time it takes to do it.
You can move faster than you think. You can train yourself to shorten the time it takes to complete tasks.
Said historian Will Durant, ‚ÄúI think the ability of the average man could be doubled if it were demanded, if the situation demanded.‚Äù
You'll be blown away how fast you can move if you just make the decision to move fast.
Action steps:
Inner critic exists in all of us.
What about successful people? They have it too. The only difference is that they have learned how to manage it.
How?
The negative self-talk actually is a form of self-absorption. What is that voice in your head saying when the critic comes out? ‚Äî ‚ÄúYou don't have what it takes. Last time you just got lucky. You'll fail.‚Äù
Notice anything? Yup ‚Äî it's all about you!
When you realize this, the solution becomes simple ‚Äî shift your perspective from yourself to how your work will help other people.
Action steps:
Successful people are growth friends to others.
They know that other people‚Äôs success doesn‚Äôt diminish their own.
While insecure people constantly doubt themselves and criticize others in order to prove their self-worth, successful people compliment and help others.
Ironically, they feel better themselves as a result.
Negativity is a choice. What choice are you making?
Action steps:
When you‚Äôre too comfortable you drown in boredom and depression as Yerkes-Dodson law illustrates:
The solution? Get used to stretching yourself. Peak performance and discomfort go hand in hand.
Success can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have and uncomfortable actions you are willing to make.
Action steps:
Successful people don't fight their human nature, they learn how to manage it.
‚ÄúI think we all have two main characters in our heads: a rational decision-maker (the adult in your head) and instant gratification monkey (the child in your head who doesn't care about consequences and just wants to maximize the ease and pleasure of the present moment).
For me, these two are in a constant battle, and the monkey usually wins. But I've found that if I turn life into a yin-yang situation ‚Äî e.g. ‚Äúwork till 6 today, then no work till tomorrow‚Äù ‚Äî it's much easier to control the monkey in the work period.‚Äù ‚Äî said Tim Urban (from WaitButWhy) on his incredible TED Talk.
By acknowledging that gratification monkey exists, you can come up with solutions. The first step toward change is awareness.
Action steps:
Nowadays people are obsessed with failure.
But the truth is you don't learn the most from failures.
This idea may make you feel better, but whenever you want to do something well, you do it by studying people who are really good and have achieved results you desire.
For example, you don't study all the failed writers to learn how to become a great storyteller; you study the world's best storytellers.
Yes, if you want to become the top 1% you will fail a lot, but don't distort your thinking that you should take all your lessons from failure.
Model what works instead.
This is how Tony Robbins does it:
The quality of your life depends on questions you ask yourself.
Ask lousy questions, get lousy answers.
You can ask, ‚ÄúWhat makes me happy?‚Äù ‚Äî You‚Äôll get a good answer.
What if you ask, ‚ÄúWhat gives me bliss?‚Äù ‚Äî You‚Äôll get a great answer.
Tim Ferris has said, ‚ÄúIn my experience, going from 1x to 10x, from 10x to 100x, and from 100x to (when Lady Luck really smiles) 1000x returns in various areas has been a product of better questions. John Dewey‚Äôs dictum that ‚Äúa problem well put is half-solved‚Äù applies.‚Äù
Growth is stimulated by asking ‚Äî Why?
Here are some great questions to ask yourself:
I urge you to kick off 2019 with a bang or even better ‚Äî set a new month resolution today!
Remember people who succeed are no smarter than you, they are just people who have acquired skills and habits through patient consistency.
So start little.
You've got this!

Aytekin Tank|9.6K|7|https://medium.com/swlh/how-wasting-time-at-work-properly-increases-productivity-76272d651ef0?source=---------8---------------------|How wasting time at work (properly) increases productivity|"If you‚Äôve ever watched a professional tennis match, you know how much stamina the sport requires. From thigh slaps to squats to light jumps, players will do just about anything to maintain their high energy and laser-focus.
A crucial part of the match, however, occurs in the brief pause between games: the 90-second changeover break, when players rest before switching sides.
Watch closely, and you‚Äôll see how players make the most of these precious moments: burying their heads under a towel to meditate, changing their racquets, or fueling up on water and energy drinks.
Some players, like the great Serena Williams, have even sipped a quick coffee before returning to the court.
Whatever their method, these pro athletes understand the value of a break. A brief reprieve can provide a fresh surge of energy and motivation for the next game.
Much like a tennis match, the workday can also be a daunting mental and physical challenge, especially if you want to perform your best throughout the day.
In addition to finding your optimal work hours, taking multiple breaks can increase your productivity all day long.
I‚Äôll repeat that for emphasis:
Our workaholic culture and the business epidemic tend to villainize time-wasting behaviors during work ‚Äî like leisurely lunches and web browsing ‚Äî but research proves that breaks can enhance your performance, on many levels.
Brief periods of distraction have been shown to improve both decision-making and creativity. On the other hand, prolonged attention to a single task can actually hinder performance. Pulling an all-nighter for one assignment? Not such a good idea after all.
There‚Äôs also evidence that waking periods of mental rest can improve memory formation. Apparently, during rest periods, your brain reviews and ingrains what it previously learned. Without rest, you run the risk of experiencing the old ‚Äúin one ear, out the other‚Äù phenomenon.
At my company, JotForm, I incorporate intentional breaks throughout the day ‚Äî and not only do I take breaks, but I try to take the right kind of breaks.
I wanted to share a few ways that help me add breaks to my workday; how to properly waste time.
You might be wondering, what kind of breaks should I take? Or, if you‚Äôre a manager, what kind of breaks should I encourage my employees to take?
Generally, a good break is one that allows your prefrontal cortex to rest. That‚Äôs the part of your brain dedicated to logical thinking, executive functioning, and using willpower to override impulses.
There are many ways to do this, but it can be as simple as letting your mind wander.
One report found that daydreaming or zoning out has similar benefits as meditation. And meditation not only increases focus, but it gives your overworked prefrontal cortex a break.
Taking a quick pause for physical activity can be extremely beneficial ‚Äî and that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to squeeze in a SoulCycle class at lunch.
Just a 5-minute walking break every hour can improve your health and mental well-being. And mental wellness is critical on a personal and a professional level because research shows that happier workplaces are more productive.
Not only are walks good for your health, but prolonged sitting is actually bad for us. That‚Äôs one of the reasons we offer most of our 110 employees both standing and normal desks.
Walking can also boost creativity. A study from Stanford University showed that when people tackled mental tasks that required imagination, walking led to more creative thinking than sitting.
In the literary world, many accomplished novelists and poets have improved their craft by walking. Just a few of these famous walkers include Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf, Henry David Thoreau, and William Wordsworth.
I‚Äôm one of these workday walkers, too. Whenever possible, I walk to lunch and take long strolls with new employees, so we can get to know each other better. At our San Francisco office, we take scenic walks on the Embarcadero and enjoy the calming bay views.
If taking a break is good, taking a break with colleagues may be even better.
Social breaks are important for both personal and professional well-being. For example, social breaks can reinforce bonds, improve morale, and increase opportunities for collaboration.
After observing the social habits at a Xerox corporate office, one study found that copy repair people who hung out in the coffee room were not wasting time ‚Äî they were engaging in productive conversations about on-the-job challenges.
Other studies have shown that informal, casual conversations between call center workers increased productivity by 20%.
To make the most of social breaks, time management expert Laura Vanderkam recommends grabbing a coffee with a mentee or taking an afternoon walk with a direct report.
Trees, plants and green spaces are not only aesthetically pleasing, but taking breaks in a natural environment can significantly boost employee well-being, reduce stress, enhance innovative potential, and strengthen personal connections.
Time in nature dramatically improves our ability to think expansively and make better decisions.
It also seems to make us more helpful. For example, people who have just walked in a park or other natural environment are more likely to notice when others need help ‚Äî and to provide that help.
It‚Äôs no coincidence that forward-thinking companies like Google and Facebook prioritize plant life in their office designs. In fact, Facebook‚Äôs most recent update to their Menlo Park headquarters included a sprawling rooftop garden.
In many East Asian countries, ‚Äúforest bathing‚Äù has also become a popular office practice, because just a few minutes in nature has measurable benefits for our psychological well-being and our physical health.
Vending machine calling your name? That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing.
Snack breaks are a great way to refresh during the workday. According to the University of Roehampton researcher Leigh Gibson, your brain works best with a consistent blood glucose level: 25 grams is optimal. So don‚Äôt forget to fuel yourself throughout the day.
Even web surfing, in moderation, can have a positive effect. Researchers at the National University of Singapore found that browsing the internet ‚Äúserves an important restorative function.‚Äù That mini-break spent shopping on Amazon can revive you for the next task.
Ultimately, almost any mental time-out is effective, as long as you‚Äôre giving your prefrontal cortex a rest. Some studies, however, do recommend that these breaks should still be work-related. Specifically, your break should be a time to learn something new, reflect on the big picture, or make positive connections with others.
With looming deadlines and colleagues waiting for answers, forcing yourself to take breaks can be challenging. At JotForm, I pre-plan my day to include both dedicated work and constructive break times.
According to MIT Sloan Senior Lecturer Bob Pozen, you should take a time-out every 75 to 90 minutes. This is based on studies of professional musicians, who are most productive when they practice for this amount of time in a single sitting.
Another approach, called the Pomodoro Technique recommends working for 25 minutes before taking a five-minute break. This may be a better approach when a single task requires your full focus.
By using trial and error, you can figure out which technique works best for you.
It‚Äôs tempting to shun the habit of taking breaks in your workday.
‚ÄúWasting time‚Äù can feel like a productivity killer. But when they‚Äôre done thoughtfully, constructive breaks can leave you and your employees feeling focused and re-energized.
While you can‚Äôt force others to take breaks, you can encourage them to take a breather from time to time.
Managers, for example, can schedule periodic breaks throughout the day and, if possible, your office should offer pleasant break spaces ‚Äî complete with coffee, snacks and plant life. If caring for plants seems burdensome, try succulents, which require little-to-no care at all.
Try creating walking clubs and schedule walking meetings.
And remember to lead by example ‚Äî give yourself breaks, too.

Martijn Verbove|802|15|https://medium.com/swlh/product-hunt-101-how-to-launch-your-product-from-early-idea-to-revenue-c3f01864cdde?source=---------9---------------------|Product Hunt 101: How To Launch Your Product From Early Idea To Revenue|"3, 2, 1, launch... right? Not quite. When you‚Äôre getting ready to launch on Product Hunt, you‚Äôve probably put months or even years of your life into this product. Failing the launch would be devastating, while doing it right can give you everything you need to turn your product into a business.
This article isn‚Äôt focused on getting upvotes, but on maximising the impact of your launch in general. By focusing on impact you‚Äôll get the fundamentals that matter most for your long-term success.
Some background: I always felt annoyed with how hard it was to keep track of the thousands of webpages we come across every month. So around 4 years ago I got the idea to create a filesystem for the web. It‚Äôs similar to the finder on a computer, but indexes text on webpages you visit. This way you can use any word on the page to retrieve it‚Äîsaving you a bunch of time every-time you need a page again.
Prior to our launch I‚Äôd spent around 1 year beta-testing. You don‚Äôt need Product Hunt to get your first users. On the contrary, you actually need a base of beta users to launch successfully. We had around 3500 beta users, which I got through contacting people in Facebook groups about Product Hunt. I used a simple message:
The main benefit to this approach is that you can literally contact thousands of people who you know are interested in or are working on new products ‚Äî since they‚Äôre in Product (Hunt) groups. You‚Äôll be surprised how many people are interested.
When someone replied, they typically asked for more information, so I made sure to give them a very brief summary of what History Search was.
This was actually the very first version of our value prop and sales pitch. I then continued the conversation with those willing/interested ‚Äî and used this information to improve the product and ‚Äústory‚Äù. Getting your story right is going to be critical during your launch.
This concludes the section about building an early-beta user audience since this article is really aimed at the next stage: leveraging your Product Hunt launch to turn your work into a business (getting reoccurring users and revenue).
Groups that worked for me
Product Hunt is a community of tech enthusiasts and product makers. Every day new products are hunted and receive upvotes. The top 5 most upvoted products get blasted in a daily newsletter to +500k members the next day.
After spending countless days, nights and dollars on History Search the main thing I needed to know was ‚Äúdo people really need History Search?‚Äù and were they willing to pay for it so I can continue working on it ‚Äî or will my hard work go in vain? Because that‚Äôs what your first users are doing in reality: they‚Äôre paying so that you can continue to work on your vision.
Obviously it‚Äôs better to finish as the top product of the day, since this will get your product in both the daily and weekly newsletter. However it‚Äôs not all about coming in first during the initial launch of your product, it‚Äôs about validation and building an engaged users base‚Äîwho are prepared to pay for your product. So as long as you get in the top 5 you‚Äôll be in the daily newsletter and you‚Äôre fine in regards to reach.
My main piece of advice about deciding when to launch is that it‚Äôs not about being done, but about being ready. The reason is simple: Your product is never going to be perfect when you launch it.
There are so many things in History Search that I want to improve. For example, I really dislike the way we onboard new users. I think it‚Äôs really tricky and confusing. But instead of iterating on it for another 2 months we launched and got it done in one day.
When you launch the right way (without focusing on upvotes), you‚Äôll get more questions, suggestions and ideas than you can ever imagine. In our case this gave us the input we needed to create an onboarding experience that answered the most common questions.
When you talk to people, you see it fall together. All of these things come up because you actually have one day where you can talk to hundreds of people. In a way you have hundreds of minds working with you ‚Äî they tell you what‚Äôs unclear about your product or message, what they love about it, and even ideas or use-cases you never thought of yourself. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to then develop everything people ask, more on that later.
Before even thinking about launching, make sure you‚Äôve thoroughly thought about how to position your product. Why did we switch from ‚ÄúYour Personal Search engine‚Äù to ‚ÄúYour Filesystem for the web‚Äù? This was because ‚Äúsearch engine‚Äù leads many people to believe it was only public pages, and so made it seem like Google. While in reality History Search does technically do the same as Google, but it indexes the web pages you visit through an integration with your browser (via browser extensions) ‚Äî so this also makes it possible to find pages behind logins.
What it is and What it does are two fundamentally different approaches to positioning, and you need both. In our case we have:
It‚Äôs important not to run this past too many people, since it will send you in a different direction every time. The main thing I learned is that your product is whatever you say it is ‚Äî for example. Is Uber a taxi company or is it the future of transportation?
Your first launch isn‚Äôt really about your product, it‚Äôs about your story and vision. The story about how you got to where you are today is important to write down, not only for the outside world but also for yourself. You‚Äôll be able to better align your pitch if you know your story well. This is exactly what I did, and even though I spent about two weeks hesitating whether to publish it or not, I eventually did. Guess what?! It was one of the best decisions I could have made ‚Äî people loved it and it even got published by The Startup. Here‚Äôs a link to the article.
Your product is never going to be perfect when you launch it. With History Search, there are so many things that I want to improve. But at first it‚Äôs all about finding the people who support you and believe in your vision.
You need a clear message. Our general tagline for History Search is ‚Äúyour way back to a million websites.‚Äù However, we deliberately decided not to use this message for Product Hunt, because we knew that it‚Äôs a more technical audience.
Your tagline has to be just right. It‚Äôs tempting to choose a funny tagline, and this might get you a lot of upvotes but:
You need an existing user base. It is very important that when you launch, you already have an existing user base. It doesn‚Äôt have to be huge, but you have to have people who really know the product already. This is critical for two reasons. You need:
You need support. Before you launch, sit down and think: Who can I genuinely ask for support to get the word of my launch out on this day? If that list of people is very small, it‚Äôs going to be difficult to launch. Because all of this is not just a way to get upvotes, it‚Äôs to get reach. And to get reach, you need some support. So you need a group of people who really believe and support the thing you‚Äôre doing.
You need a plan for getting press. This is extremely difficult for people who are launching for the first time. If you read an article about how to reach out to press, most of it is incorrect. Most of it is written by journalists, and they assume that the best way is by writing a custom email ‚Äî which may work for larger brands, but not startups.
When preparing for the History Search launch, I wrote custom emails to almost 20 people. I spent 2.5 weeks researching.
How many journalists replied? One. And he just replied to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt write about these types of services anymore.‚Äù
So you need to keep some things in mind when you‚Äôre contacting journalists.
Send the story in the email with the press information 3‚Äì5 days before launching. This is the email I used:
If journalists don‚Äôt reply to your email 3‚Äì5 days after you pitch, it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not going to cover you. I recommend sending a follow-up email in the evening of your launch ‚Äî not the same pitch ‚Äî with the result. You could even do it the next day so that you don‚Äôt bombard the journalist with the same press release over and over.
Don‚Äôt be worried if you don‚Äôt get any responses. Our story just appeared on CNET but they had never replied. I discovered the story because I couldn‚Äôt figure out why our traffic was still increasing after the launch (usually it drops) and I used Mention to find the article on CNET.
Keep in mind: If journalists from publications like CNET, Mashable, etc, are willing to write about you. Then they are helping you, you are not helping them. I am extremely grateful that Stephen Shankland, the CNET journalist, decided, based on the story I wrote, to write about History Search. He can write about a billion other things, and he chose us.
If you‚Äôre lost about what to write in your emails to journalists, here‚Äôs the basic formula for a pitch. I should actually say story and not pitch.
These are simple marketing rules, but I can guarantee that 99 out of 100 statements sent out to press do not have this last step (CTA).
In my case, I was quite sincere, and I was willing to create a story that was interesting to their audience. I would like to get History Search into the world and to reach as many people as possible.
So when it comes to press, be genuine. An event is as good as its best story, so tell yours in a way people want to read about it and you‚Äôve got a big chance getting covered.
It‚Äôs super important to make sure the different components of your listing work together ‚Äî since space to tell your story is limited. Let‚Äôs start with the first part of your message that appears in the Product Hunt feed.
What we did was use the thumbnail to show someone how it worked, and made sure the title, tagline (and don‚Äôt forget the ‚Äútags‚Äù ex. Productivity) worked together. You see how we selected productivity to show up as first ‚Äî this is because it‚Äôs a part of the story.
Next are your slides. Remember people might be intrigued by your tagline but probably still don‚Äôt understand how to use your product. That‚Äôs why we mainly used this to show use cases.
You can then use your opening comment to introduce yourself and give more details, the image is too long to post here so I‚Äôd recommend that you check out our listing here: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/history-search this will also give you an impression of what kind of responses and questions you can expect.
Tips
1 Size matters. Keep your slides under 2MB each or they‚Äôll have trouble loading for visitors on mobile or weak internet connections (ImageOptim worked great for me)
2 YouTube videos in comments. Not many people know you can also post videos in the comment section. So I‚Äôd keep the main slide to use-cases only and add your video in the comments.
3 OG Images. The first slide is automatically set as the image shown when people share your post to social media‚Äîmake it easy to load (less than 1 MB) and add slightly more context in the image.
Launch day itself is super hectic. You get distracted all the time. You need a plan ‚Äî not so that you stick to the plan perfectly, but so that you have something to reference in the midst of all the distraction. If you get a bug or an email or a news post that you have to answer on the fly, you know where to continue, because you‚Äôve created this plan.
I‚Äôve actually made the structure I used available in an Airtable (see below), it‚Äôs nothing fancy but it‚Äôs all you need to plan your launch. It‚Äôs structured as followed:
First, don‚Äôt look at your ranking. You worked really hard to make something, and you don‚Äôt want to see that you are 3rd, 4th, 5th etc. on your launch date ‚Äî it will only distract you.
With History Search, people in the office looked at it, but I didn‚Äôt. I made a plan for how this launch date was going to go.
Of all of these activities, engaging with your audience could be the most important. After years working on your startup, you might be the Albert Einstein of your product, but you can‚Äôt beat a million brains thinking together. Or even just a thousand brains. And the bottom line is that if you have a thousand people out there who are willing to talk about your product, talk with them.
First of all, it‚Äôs an amazing feeling to get support and hear from people who love your work. And second, you will learn things that you could never have imagined.
For example:
Your launch isn‚Äôt actually about you giving something to the world. It is actually you getting something: you get an opportunity to talk to people and get feedback. It‚Äôs very important that you learn from the people who are interested and also from the people who are not interested.
Especially the people who are not interested ‚Äî this is super important. Talk to those people, and don‚Äôt try to convince them. You really want to get down to the core reason of why they like or don‚Äôt like your product. And sometimes, someone will ask you about a use case you hadn‚Äôt considered, like the guy who asked if we could use History Search without indexing automatically. Because of his question, I realized that this is actually possible. You can pause the extension and then favorite a web page manually‚Äîso there you go, another selling-point without developing anything new.
Tips
1 Go Live. Go live in the morning. Social media notifies everyone of this and it will be boosted through your Facebook and Instagram followers.
2 Wait to win. The daily Product Hunt race starts at 00:00 PDT, but I‚Äôd recommend you wait an hour to see who launches on Product Hunt because if for ex. Google launches something new you‚Äôll have to compete with them.
3 Don‚Äôt expect anything of Reddit or Hacker news. Sure, there are ways to use these channels, but not unless you really build a strategy.
4 Engaging. When people engage with you, really talk to them, try to understand and learn because this is your chance.
5Traction on content matters most. Don‚Äôt link dump, it‚Äôs better to target and generate interaction in a few groups, because practically all social media only boosts content that get a lot of comments.
A few groups that I‚Äôve been in and contain many supportive and entrepreneurial people:
So did we get the validation we were looking for?
Once you‚Äôve launched, the things you learn mean you can never go back to your pre-launch perspective. My most important takeaways?
So what‚Äôs next for History Search? As I said, feedback was the most valuable thing we received from our launch date. We‚Äôre using the feedback around our onboarding process, to improve our onboarding. Stay tuned for a later article that goes deeper into that process.

Andy Raskin|55K|8|https://medium.com/the-mission/the-greatest-sales-deck-ive-ever-seen-4f4ef3391ba0?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|The Greatest Sales Deck I‚Äôve Ever Seen ‚Äì The Mission ‚Äì Medium|"A few months ago, my friend Tim took a new sales job at a Series C tech company that had raised over $60 million from A-list investors. He‚Äôs one of the best salespeople I know, but soon after starting, he emailed me to say he was struggling.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve landed a few small accounts,‚Äù Tim said. ‚ÄúBut my pitch falls flat at big enterprises.‚Äù
As I‚Äôve written before, I love helping teams craft the high-level strategic story that powers sales, marketing, fundraising ‚Äî everything. So Tim and I met for lunch at the Amber India restaurant off San Francisco‚Äôs Market Street to review his deck.
After loading up on the all-you-can-eat buffet, I asked Tim, ‚ÄúAt what point do prospects tune out?‚Äù
‚ÄúUsually a few slides in,‚Äù he said.
Intent on maximizing dining ROI, Tim went back to the buffet for seconds. When he returned, I pulled out my laptop and launched into a Powerpoint presentation.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù Tim asked.
‚ÄúThis,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúis the greatest sales deck I have ever seen.‚Äù
The sales deck I showed Tim came from Zuora, the IPO-bound Silicon Valley company that sells a SaaS platform for subscription billing. If you pay for anything on a recurring basis (e.g. enterprise software), there‚Äôs a good chance that Zuora facilitates those transactions.
I had received the deck from an ex-Zuora salesperson, who said it helped him close the biggest deals of his career. (I have no connection to Zuora, and no relationship with anyone who currently works there. UPDATE: Some current Zuora employees have connected with me after reading this.)
Abandoning his naan in a puddle of curried goat, Tim grabbed pen and paper and took notes as we ran through what made the Zuora deck so effective.
Specifically, we noted how brilliantly the deck led prospects through the following five elements, in precisely this order:
(The ex-Zuora salesperson asked that I not share the Zuora deck publicly, and I will honor that request. However, I found slides on Zuora‚Äôs website and SlideShare channel that exhibit nearly the same narrative flow; all of the images below come from those public sources.)
Don‚Äôt kick off a sales presentation by talking about your product, your headquarters locations, your investors, your clients, or anything about yourself.
Instead, name the undeniable shift in the world that creates both (a) big stakes and (b) huge urgency for your prospect.
The first slide of virtually every Zuora deck ‚Äî sales or otherwise ‚Äî is some version of this:
Zuora came up with the phrase ‚Äúsubscription economy‚Äù to name the trend in which buyers increasingly choose recurring service payments over outright purchases. Zuora usually follows that with a slide laying out the history of the change:
Note the subtle but important difference from what most pitch advice tells you, which is to start with ‚Äúthe problem.‚Äù When you assert that your prospects have a problem, you put them on the defensive. They may be unaware of the problem, or uncomfortable admitting they suffer from it.
But when you highlight a shift in the world, you get prospects to open up about how that shift affects them, how it scares them, and where they see opportunities. Most importantly, you grab their attention. As Hollywood screenwriting guru Robert McKee says:
All prospects suffer from what economists call ‚Äúloss aversion.‚Äù That is, they tend to avoid a possible loss by sticking to the status quo, rather than risk a possible gain by opting for change.
To combat loss aversion, you must demonstrate how the change you cited above will create big winners and big losers. In other words, you have to show both of the following:
Zuora neatly accomplishes this by documenting a ‚Äúmass extinction‚Äù among Fortune 500 companies...
...and then showing how the ‚Äúwinners‚Äù have shifted from product ownership to subscription services. Those include upstarts...
...as well as rejuvenated incumbents:
To bring the point home, Zuora asks the following:
Of course, by this point the common thread is already well established in prospects‚Äô minds: Winners adopt the subscription service models that Zuora supports.
It‚Äôs tempting at this point to jump into the details of your product or service. Resist that urge.
If you introduce product/service details too soon, prospects won‚Äôt yet have enough context for why those details are important, and they‚Äôll tune out.
Instead, first present a ‚Äúteaser‚Äù vision of the happily-ever-after that your product/service will help the prospect achieve‚Äîwhat I call the Promised Land.
Your Promised Land should be both desirable (obviously) and difficult for the prospect to achieve without outside help. Otherwise, why does your company exist?
After demonstrating that the subscription economy will result in winners and losers, Zuora presents this Promised Land slide, which offers concrete criteria for what it means to win in the subscription economy:
Note that the Promised Land is a new future state, not your product or service.
(Over lunch, I asked my friend Tim to articulate his Promised Land, and he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have the most innovative platform for ____.‚Äù Nope: the Promised Land is not having your technology, but what life is like thanks to having your technology.)
Your Promised Land is also crucial for helping prospects pitch your solution to colleagues after your sales meeting ends. In your absence, those colleagues will ask, ‚ÄúWhat do those guys do again?‚Äù Armed with a compelling Promised Land, your prospects are more likely to supply an answer that gets others on board.
If it‚Äôs not clear by now, successful sales decks follow the same narrative structure as epic films and fairy tales. Your prospect is Luke, and you‚Äôre Obi Wan, furnishing a lightsaber to help him defeat the Empire. Your prospect is Frodo, and you‚Äôre Gandalf, wielding wizardry to help him destroy the ring. Your prospect is Cinderella, and you‚Äôre the fairy godmother, casting spells to get her to the ball.
When you introduce your product or service, do so by positioning its capabilities like the lightsaber, wizardry and spells‚Äîas ‚Äúmagic gifts‚Äù for helping your main character (prospect) reach that much-desired Promised Land.
For example, above is the slide where Zuora talks about the structure of its customer record. Out of context, this detail would likely bore even the most technical prospect.
Positioned in the context of transitioning from an ‚Äúold world‚Äù to a ‚Äúnew world,‚Äù however, it‚Äôs the foundation for an engaging conversation with prospects‚Äîtechnical and otherwise‚Äîabout why it‚Äôs so hard to reach the Promised Land with traditional solutions.
In telling the sales narrative this way, you‚Äôre making a commitment to prospects: If they go with you, you‚Äôll get them to the Promised Land.
But the road to the Promised Land is, by definition, littered with obstacles, so prospects are rightly skeptical of your ability to deliver. The last piece of the pitch, then, is the best evidence you can offer that you can make the story you‚Äôre telling come true.
By far, the most effective type of evidence is a success story about how you‚Äôve already helped someone else (who is similar to the prospect) reach the Promised Land. Zuora has a set of customer success stories that sales reps draw on, and while they‚Äôre more elaborate in the actual deck, this testimonial captures the essence:
I also like this one, from an exec at NCR (a Zuora customer), which speaks more explicitly to Zuora‚Äôs stated Promised Land:
What if you don‚Äôt yet have a huge number of successful customers? Product demos are the next most effective evidence, but again, features should always be presented in the context of how they help a prospect reach the Promised Land.
Of course, successful sales rarely happen solely as the result of a great deck. In order for salespeople to be successful, the entire organization must align around the narrative about change, Promised Land, and Magic Gifts.
There‚Äôs no better example of that than Zuora. If you ever see a Zuora executive speak‚Äîincluding CEO Tien Tzuo‚Äîyou‚Äôll almost certainly hear about the subscription economy and the winners and losers it‚Äôs creating. In fact, that‚Äôs the theme of virtually all the company‚Äôs marketing communications and campaigns, as well as its public vision statement:
According to the ex-Zuora salesperson, this company-wide alignment around the story made him wildly successful:
Just three weeks after our lunch, Tim called to say he was seeing promising changes in how prospects at large enterprises were reacting to his new deck, which we drafted together based on Zuora‚Äôs template. For one thing, prospects opened up much faster about the challenges they were facing. Also, he said the new pitch was more effective at engaging CFOs and other senior gatekeepers.
Then, a week after that, Tim emailed with even better news: He had just signed the largest deal in his company‚Äôs history.
Next week, we‚Äôre headed back to Amber India to celebrate.

Preethi Kasireddy|70K|12|https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|Why I‚Äôm leaving Silicon Valley ‚Äì Preethi Kasireddy ‚Äì Medium|"Here‚Äôs something I never thought I‚Äôd say: this is my last week in Silicon Valley.
This post is a personal one. Rather than sharing insights on Blockchain or Javascript, I‚Äôd like to walk through my inner journey the past few years.
It‚Äôs a journey that‚Äôs left me itching for change ‚Äî and driving down to Los Angeles to set up a new home base is a big one!
I moved to Silicon Valley during the summer of 2012, a little over five years ago. I had just graduated college and serendipitously landed here because of a new job offer. I was eager and anxious to start my career out here and frankly had no idea what to expect.
As it turned out, I lucked out ‚Äî Silicon Valley is one of the best places in the world for entrepreneurs, engineers, and anyone bold enough to try and change the world through technology.
...This was a stark contrast to life in my New Jersey hometown, where most people went to the community college, pursued 9-to-5 jobs, and settled into comfortable lives by their mid-20s. There was very little space there for thinking big, or taking risks, or creating your own career path.
So, landing in San Francisco was the best kind of culture shock imaginable. Suddenly, I was surrounded by technology and innovation and immersed in a community where challenging yourself was actually encouraged.
The next three years of living in San Francisco had a path-altering impact on my life, as I began to learn that crazy ideas aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù for those of us willing to put in the work and take a few risks.
That first post-college job was as an analyst at Goldman Sachs, where I was able to learn how tech company financials work at a fundamental level through working with CEOs and CFOs preparing for IPO rounds and acquisitions. This was hugely beneficial when I later moved on to working with some of those tech companies directly, and planted the seeds of my interest in solving problems with software.
After a year at Goldman Sachs, however, I realized that a career in banking was not what I wanted long term. I wanted to go back to being an engineer as I had been in college. So I decided to go against the grain and say goodbye to a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù position. Where was I off to next?
Well, I was on the brink of leaving to join as a systems engineer for a small industrial startup in the middle of the country. But after a random cold email followed by a long series of unexpected events, I got an offer to join Andreessen Horowitz on the deal team. It was an opportunity I couldn‚Äôt pass up ‚Äî and thank God I didn‚Äôt.
I spent the next two years at Andreessen Horowitz, where I worked with and learned from the pioneers of the web, like Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, Chris Dixon, and many others. I saw thousands of companies come through the doors ‚Äî I saw their ideas, their teams, their challenges and their strengths. I learned the ins and outs of building a successful technology startup, and on the flip side, learned the common mistakes that lead to failure. Most importantly, I met incredible entrepreneurs who inspired me to also become like them one day.
When I left a16z, I made the transition to software engineering. I was young and wanted to go out and just build stuff for the world. You could say that I had ‚Äúentrepreneur envy‚Äù ‚Äî I was eager to build products day to day, and eventually start my own company. I‚Äôve written about my experience extensively in the past.
This transition was nothing short of amazing. I was learning and growing at a break-neck pace. I was passionate and excited by my work. Frankly, I was having so much fun being an engineer that not a single day felt like ‚Äúwork‚Äù.
But beyond just loving my work, I also felt empowered. Empowered to do things I never thought were possible before. Because being an engineer gave me freedom. Freedom to build anything I want, whenever I want and wherever I want. The freedom to learn how everything works at a fundamental level. The freedom to teach and empower new developers. And most importantly, the freedom to be a creator and literally, create something from nothing.
It was only after I left Andreessen Horowitz to return to an engineering track that my feelings about life in Silicon Valley started to change.
Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world ‚Äî Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea ‚Äî and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn‚Äôt the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening.
What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
This isn‚Äôt exactly a surprise, since one of the Internet‚Äôs core functions is to make access to knowledge available everywhere. I personally taught myself almost everything I know about programming on the internet (outside some fundamentals from Hack Reactor), for free. And I‚Äôm just one of thousands of learners using the Internet to access information that used to be limited to elite colleges like Stanford, Berkeley, or MIT.
These days, techies aren‚Äôt limited to Silicon Valley if they want to find funding and a community. Many other cities with active and relevant tech scenes have their own unique cultures, art, cuisines, and activities to offer.
Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I‚Äôm not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately.
What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story ‚Äî whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered... but within the Valley, you‚Äôd hear the same stories over and over.
Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I‚Äôd overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing ‚Äî the like-mindedness ‚Äî was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking ‚Äî group think as they call it.
Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.
This isn‚Äôt to say Silicon Valley hasn‚Äôt taught me anything important.
It‚Äôs been a perfect place to learn to take risks. A place to learn the value of creating your own path, and to prove to myself that I can do it.
While living here, I‚Äôve made a deliberate effort to say yes to my dreams. I wanted the freedom to build anything I want, and I earned that. I wanted to learn and grow as quickly as possible, and I‚Äôve proven that. I wanted to meet people from around the world and learn from them, and I got that. I wanted to find my purpose instead of following a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù path, and I did that.
Most importantly, I wanted to pave a path that is unique to me, and I‚Äôm doing exactly that. I‚Äôm only a couple years into it, and the future feels unlimited.
Looking back, when I left Andreessen Horowitz to pursue this path, I set out a three-part roadmap for myself:
I spent the past two years learning many different areas of programming (e.g. web development, mobile development, distributed systems, etc.) and various application areas (e.g. machine learning, blockchain, etc.). I purposely stayed broad and exposed myself to as much as possible, and learned to code things that interested me most. Eventually, I fell in love with blockchain development.
My fascination with blockchains started when we first made the investment in Coinbase at a16z, and ever since, I‚Äôve been keeping up with the technology and eventually joined Coinbase as a software engineer, which helped me further dive deeper into the space. After Coinbase, I continued to tinker and teach myself various aspects of blockchain, and now I‚Äôm at phase two, where I‚Äôm focusing on getting really good at it. The next step is to use my skills to ‚Äúbuild a world-changing company or something else entirely‚Äù.
Leading the path I want to lead doesn‚Äôt require me to be in Silicon valley anymore. I don‚Äôt need to be here to follow my personal roadmap. Having the freedom of an engineer to learn and grow as an entrepreneur, writer, and speaker has opened me up to a whole new world. It made me realize that I can be an engineer, entrepreneur, writer and speaker from anywhere in the world.
The world is becoming increasingly global. Silicon Valley is just one way of living. One way of thinking. One way of viewing the world. But there‚Äôs so many other ways. Because after all, technology is global, engineering is global, innovation is global and entrepreneurship is global.
It‚Äôs evident by the fact that we now see countries like India and China leap frog generations of western technology and even inventing their own ways ‚Äî take mPesa in Kenya, Paytm in India, or WeChat in China.
Moreover, it‚Äôs become easier than ever to connect with anyone thousands of miles away. Being physically present is no longer a requirement. I can code from South Africa and still ship a product to someone in Silicon Valley.
Beyond this, what really nudged me was when I realized that the blockchain revolution is global. I‚Äôve spent the past year doing research and development in blockchain technologies, and noticed that many cities outside of the valley, like New York, Berlin, Toronto, Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Bangkok, are making immense strides in pushing blockchains forward. Many well known projects and efforts to bring blockchain to the masses are being started from places outside of Silicon Valley. For once, I noticed that Silicon Valley isn‚Äôt the center of it.
So then a crazy idea came to my head. Can I leave Silicon Valley and still pursue my dreams? Can I still build a massive and world-changing company? Can I still make a big impact in this world?
The answer to that increasingly became a clear yes.
Of course, there‚Äôs a strong argument for staying in Silicon Valley. After all, this place has a massive network of entrepreneurs and people who ‚Äúget it‚Äù. This place knows how to breed amazing startups. Moreover, I‚Äôve personally built up a great network in Silicon Valley over the past five years. I could easily stay and lead a very successful life here, financially at least.
But frankly, I don‚Äôt want to. That feels a bit too easy. I‚Äôm young, passionate, and driven ‚Äî I can‚Äôt let inertia, familiarity, comfort or money hold me back from going on to to doing bigger and harder things. I‚Äôm going to challenge myself. I‚Äôm going to fight for my goals. To work day and night for them. And money isn‚Äôt going to get me any of these things.
Money has never been my main motivator. I left Goldman Sachs before my first-year bonus because I was too eager to sit back for two months hating my life, instead of starting my new career at a16z. Then I left an amazing career at a16z to go become a developer. Challenge and impact are what gets me out of bed in the morning.
I have this burning desire to do even more, see more and experience more, outside of Silicon Valley. When the opportunity exists to experience a whole new city and still do what I love, why not just go out there and try? Why not try to expose myself to ideas in a place where the opportunities are wide open? Why not meet other types of people, learn other skills, and live on the edge a little?
Here I am: ready to do exactly that!
Perhaps my feeling and frustrations towards Silicon Valley and San Francisco are merely a fact of being here for too long. Perhaps they‚Äôre just from me needing a change. Perhaps they‚Äôre just from finding my true calling as an engineer, builder, writer and entrepreneur and realizing that I can do that from anywhere.
I‚Äôm ready to pick up my bags and embark onto the next adventure in Los Angeles.
Am I scared?
Hell yeah I‚Äôm scared.
I know practically no one in Los Angeles except for a few college friends who I haven‚Äôt spoken to in years. While on one hand, this sounds scary, on the other hand, I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôm beyond ecstatic to get out there and build up my network from ground up, just like I have done for the past five years in Silicon Valley.
And the best part is, I can always come back here ‚Äî for a day, a week or a month. Silicon Valley is where my entire network is, and they aren‚Äôt going anywhere. If I come back a year, or two years, or even five years from now, most of them will still be here.
So why the heck would I choose Los Angeles of all places? Lots of reasons!
Of course, every city has it‚Äôs flaws. Let‚Äôs not even get into the traffic situation in LA ;)
As some of you may know, I‚Äôve been heavily focused in the blockchain space for a while now. I hope to share more details about my next project in the coming months.
In the meantime, look out for more updates from me, whether it‚Äôs posts to teach you blockchain, videos for my #AskPreethi series, or pictures of me sitting on Venice beach with my laptop being a nerd and coding üòé
Still here? Good! Here‚Äôs the mic. Have you ever made a ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù move to chase something you wanted? Tell me about it in the comments so we can keep the fire going!
Blockchain Engineer. I have a passion for understanding things at a fundamental level and sharing it as clearly as possible.

Daniel Colin James|69K|7|https://hackernoon.com/how-google-collapsed-b6ffa82198ee?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|This is how Google will collapse ‚Äì Hacker Noon|"Google made almost all its money from ads. It was a booming business ‚Äî until it wasn‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs how things looked right before the most spectacular crash the technology industry had ever seen.
Search was Google‚Äôs only unambiguous win, as well as its primary source of revenue, so when Amazon rapidly surpassed Google as the top product search destination, Google‚Äôs foundations began to falter. As many noted at the time, the online advertising industry experienced a major shift from search to discovery in the mid-2010s.
While Google protected its monopoly on the dying search advertising market, Facebook ‚Äî Google‚Äôs biggest competitor in the online advertising space ‚Äî got on the right side of the trend and dominated online advertising with its in-feed native display advertising.
In late 2015, Apple ‚Äî Google‚Äôs main competitor in the mobile space ‚Äî added a feature to their phones and tablets that allowed users to block ads.
Devices running iOS were responsible for an estimated 75% of Google‚Äôs revenue from mobile search ads, so by making this move, Apple was simultaneously weighing in decisively on the great ad blocking debate of the 2010s and dealing a substantial blow to the future of online advertising.
A year later, as the internet went mobile, so too did ad blocking. The number of people blocking ads on a mobile device grew 102% from 2015 to 2016; by the end of 2016, an estimated 16% of smartphone users globally were blocking ads when browsing the internet on a mobile device. The number was as high as 25% for desktop and laptop users in the United States, a country that accounted for 47% of Google‚Äôs revenue.
The people most likely to block ads were also the most valuable demographic: millennials and high earners.
Internet users had spoken, and they hated ads.
In early 2017, Google announced its plans to build an ad blocker into its popular Google Chrome browser. Google‚Äôs ad blocker would only block ads that were deemed unacceptable by the Coalition For Better Ads, effectively allowing the company to use its dominant web browser to strengthen its already dominant advertising business.
Even after making this desperate and legally questionable move, it would quickly become clear to Google that even though ads were getting better, ad blocking numbers would continue to rise. Google had given even more people a small taste of what an ad-free internet experience could look like.
The company discovered that it wasn‚Äôt just annoying ads that people didn‚Äôt like; it was ads in general.
A key platform where Google served ads was YouTube, which it bought in 2006 and quickly turned into one of its biggest entities. But even with a sixth of the world visiting this video-sharing behemoth every month, YouTube never became profitable. In an attempt to combat the effect of ad blockers, YouTube launched an ad-free subscription model in late 2015, but the subscription numbers were underwhelming.
YouTube‚Äôs already insurmountable problems multiplied in early 2017 as advertisers began to pull out amid ad placement controversies, and huge revenue generators began to leave the site.
Even those who weren‚Äôt blocking ads had trained themselves to ignore them entirely. Researchers dubbed this phenomenon ‚Äúbanner blindness‚Äù. The average banner ad was clicked on by a dismal 0.06% of viewers, and of those clicks, roughly 50% were accidental.
Research showed that 54% of users reported a lack of trust as their reason for not clicking banner ads and 33% found them completely intolerable. These figures painted a pretty grim picture for the sustainability of online advertising, but especially for Google‚Äôs position within the industry.
If losing a major portion of their audience and annoying the rest wasn‚Äôt bad enough, Google also failed to get ahead of one of the biggest shifts in technology‚Äôs history. They recognized the importance of artificial intelligence but their approach missed the mark. Since Google‚Äôs search pillar had become unstable, a lot was riding on the company‚Äôs strategy for artificial intelligence.
Google‚Äôs then-CEO Sundar Pichai famously predicted in 2016 that ‚Äúthe next big step will be for the very concept of the ‚Äòdevice‚Äô to fade away‚Äù and that ‚Äúover time, the computer itself ‚Äî whatever its form factor ‚Äî will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world.‚Äù
Google‚Äôs ability to acknowledge the coming trend and still fail to land in front of it reminded many observers of its catastrophic failures in the booming industries of social media and instant messaging.
Meanwhile, in 2014, Amazon released a product called Amazon Echo, a small speaker that could sit in your home and answer questions, perform tasks, and buy things online for you. The Echo was a smash success. Google released its copycat product, Google Home, two years later, but it was already too late to catch up, and had no clear revenue strategy.
Alexa ‚Äî the assistant that lived inside the Echo ‚Äî on the other hand, was quickly integrated into several products and services, and its monetization model was clear, viable, and most importantly future-friendly. The Echo made it easy to order products through Amazon, and every time someone used an Echo to purchase something, Amazon made money.
Google extended the reach of their virtual assistant by building it into Android, but doing so still didn‚Äôt provide an answer for how the technology would generate enough revenue to sustain Google‚Äôs expanding repertoire of expensive innovations.
Google‚Äôs ads relied on screens, yet voice interaction subverted screens entirely. Google briefly tried playing audio ads with the Google Home, but consumers were far from receptive. Investors started to voice their concerns in 2017, but Sundar Pichai told them not to worry, leaving them to assume that Google would use their age-old strategy and analyze users‚Äô voice searches so that users could be shown more suitable ads on devices with screens.
Headlines in early 2017 proclaimed that ‚ÄúAlexa Just Conquered CES. The World is Next.‚Äù Amazon then made their technology available to third party manufacturers, putting even more distance between the two companies. Amazon had already beaten Google once before, holding 54% of the cloud computing market (compared to Google‚Äôs 3%) in 2016, and they were just getting started.
By early 2017, Amazon had begun closing in on the entire retail industry.
At its peak, Google had a massive and loyal user-base across a staggering number of products, but advertising revenue was the glue that held everything together. As the numbers waned, Google‚Äôs core began to buckle under the weight of its vast empire.
Google was a driving force in the technology industry ever since its disruptive entry in 1998. But in a world where people despised ads, Google‚Äôs business model was not innovation-friendly, and they missed several opportunities to pivot, ultimately rendering their numerous grand and ambitious projects unsustainable. Innovation costs money, and Google‚Äôs main stream of revenue had started to dry up.
In a few short years, Google had gone from a fun, commonplace verb to a reminder of how quickly a giant can fall.

Ben Yu|12.2K|75|https://medium.com/@intenex/cryptocurrency-101-7197684775fd?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|Cryptocurrency 101 ‚Äì Ben Yu ‚Äì Medium|"Ever since Nas Daily‚Äôs video came out about how I earned over $400,000 with less than $10,000 investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum, I‚Äôve been getting hundreds of questions from people around the world about how to get started with cryptocurrency investment.
First: I‚Äôm super glad there‚Äôs so much interest in cryptocurrency right now. I firmly do believe that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has the potential to fundamentally change much of the way our world currently operates for the better. It reminds me a lot of the internet in the 90s.
Second: Investment in cryptocurrency isn‚Äôt something to be taken lightly. It‚Äôs extremely risky, extremely speculative, and extremely early stage still at this point in time. Countless speculators and day traders have lost their entire fortunes trading cryptocurrency. I was no different when I first started investing in crypto. The first $5000 I put into crypto fell almost immediately to less than $500 ‚Äî a net loss of over 90%.
Third: All of the following words are entirely and solely my own opinion, and do not reflect any objective truth in the world or the opinions or perspective of any other individual or entity. I write them here merely so people can know how I personally approach cryptocurrency, and what I have personally found helpful in my foray into this realm.
I‚Äôm firmly of the opinion that one should never invest in something one doesn‚Äôt thoroughly understand, so I‚Äôm going to split this article into three parts.
The first part will speak to a broad explanation of what bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large are. The second will discuss my personal investment philosophy as it pertains to crypto. The third will show you step by step how to actually begin investing in crypto, if you so choose. Each section will be clearly delineated, so feel free to skip parts if they‚Äôre already familiar to you.
Great question. If you want the full story behind the advent of bitcoin, I highly recommend the book Digital Gold. It traces the entire history of bitcoin from its inception all the way up to 2015. It‚Äôs an engrossing read, and highly informative.
For now, let‚Äôs start with a quick history lesson about bitcoin. Bitcoin was officially unveiled to the public in a white paper published October 31st, 2008. The white paper is actually extremely readable, very short (just 8 pages), and incredibly elegantly written. If you want to understand why bitcoin is so compelling straight from the horse‚Äôs mouth, you must read this paper. It will explain everything better than I or anyone else likely ever could.
I won‚Äôt delve too much into the technical details of how bitcoin works (which are better elucidated in the white paper), but will instead focus on a broader exploration of its history and implications.
Bitcoin was invented in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, and the crisis was a clear motivating factor for its creation.
Numerous banks and other financial institutions failed across the world, and had to be bailed out by governments at the expense of their taxpayers. This underscored the fragility of the modern financial system, where the health of our monetary system is reliant on banks and other financial institutions that we are forced to trust to make wise and prudent decisions with the money we give them. Too often for comfort, they fail to carry out this fiduciary responsibility to an adequate degree.
Of particular note is fractional reserve banking. When you give a bank $1,000, the bank doesn‚Äôt actually keep all that money for you. It goes out and is legally allowed to spend up to $900 of your money, and keep just $100 in the off chance that you ask for your money back.
In the most simplistic case, if you are the only depositor at this bank, and you ask for more than $100 back at once, the bank won‚Äôt be able to give you your money, because it doesn‚Äôt have it any more.
Shockingly, this is actually how banks work in reality. In the United States, the reserve requirement, or the percentage of net deposits banks are actually required to keep in liquid financial instruments on hand, is generally 10% for most banks. This means that if a bank has net deposits of a billion dollars, it needs to only keep 100 million on hand at any given time.
This is fine most of the time, as generally the customers of that bank won‚Äôt all try to cash out at the same time, and the bank is able to stay liquid. However, the moment customers start to question the bank‚Äòs financial stability, things can go south very quickly. If just a small number of customers begin asking for all their deposits back, a bank can rapidly become depleted of all its liquid funds.
This leads to what‚Äôs known as a bank run, where the bank fails because it is unable to fulfill all the withdrawals customers demand. This can escalate quickly into a systemic bank panic, where multiple banks begin to suffer the same fate. Each successive failure compounds the collective panic, and quite quickly, the whole system can begin to collapse like a house of cards.
This is what led in large part to the Great Depression, for instance. The whole system is fundamentally predicated on trust in the system, and the second that vanishes, everything can go south incredibly quickly.
The financial crisis of 2008 highlighted yet another risk of the modern banking system. When a bank goes out and spends the 90% of net deposits it holds in investments, it can often make very bad bets, and lose all that money. In the case of the 2008 crisis, banks in particular bet on high risk subprime mortgages. These were mortgages taken out by borrowers very likely to become delinquent, to purchase houses that were sharply inflated in value by the rampant ease of acquiring a mortgage.
When those mortgages were defaulted on, the artificially inflated values of the homes began to collapse, and banks were left holding assets worth far less than the amount they had lent out. As a consequence, they now had nowhere near the amount of money that customers had given them, and began experiencing liquidity crises that led to their ultimate bankruptcy and demise.
After the Great Depression occurred, the government attempted to address this issue by creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which technically guarantees all customer deposits in participating banks up to $250,000 per account.
Unfortunately, the FDIC is just as dramatically underfunded as banks are. As the FDIC itself acknowledges, it holds enough money to cover just over 1% of all the deposits it insures. In other words, if banks reneged on any more than 1% of all their deposits, the FDIC itself would also fail, and everyone would yet again be left in the dust without recourse.
In fact, this has already happened. The FDIC used to have a sister corporation that insured savings and loan institutions, as it itself at the time only insured bank deposits, and not savings and loan institution deposits. This was known as the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, or FSLIC.
In the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, over 1,000 of the 3,200 savings and loan institutions in the United States failed in rapid succession. The FSLIC almost immediately became insolvent itself, and had to be recapitalized several times with over $25 billion dollars of taxpayer money. Even this didn‚Äôt even come close to being sufficient to solve the crisis, and the FSLIC managed to only resolve the failure of less than 300 of the 1000 bankrupt institutions, even with all the handouts from taxpayers, before it just flat out gave up and dissolved itself.
For the most part, things generally work fine on a day to day basis. This belies, however, the true fragility of the system. It‚Äôs hard to anticipate these things before they happen, because it‚Äôs so easy to fall into the trap of assuming that things will always be as they mostly always have been. If things have been fine yesterday, and the day before, and the few years before that, or even the few decades before that, we just naturally assume that they will continue to be fine for the indefinite future.
History has proven this to be an often fatal assumptive error. The second things start to stop working, they tend to stop working in an extremely rapid, catastrophic fashion. There‚Äôs very little, if anything, stopping us from seeing another Great Depression sometime in the future, be it the near or longer term future. When that does happen ‚Äî and it almost certainly will, sooner or later, if history is any good teacher ‚Äî those who haven‚Äôt adequately prepared for it and taken appropriate prophylactic measures may very well find themselves in a bad spot.
Mistrust in fiat currencies, or currencies created and backed solely by faith in a government, both because of the modern banking system and because of the inherent nature of fiat currency, has in large part been why gold has been used as such a reliable store of value over millennia.
Fiat currencies are the world‚Äôs predominant form of currency today. The US dollar or the British pound, for instance, are fiat currencies. These are currencies that are entirely controlled in their supply and creation by a national government, and are backed by nothing but faith in that government.
This has proved a mistake countless times throughout history. Zimbabwe is a classic example, where the Zimbabwean dollar, thanks to an incompetent government among other factors, experienced enormous levels of hyperinflation. At one point, inflation was estimated at almost 80 billion percent in just a single month.The following image gives an idea of just how rapidly and absurdly a fiat currency can spiral out of control, once it reaches the point of no return.
Lest we think this an isolated instance, Venezuela is experiencing incredibly similar hyperinflation in the present-day, right this moment. The Venezuelan BoliÃÅvar inflated over 800% in 2016, and shows no signs of stopping in 2017.
The US hasn‚Äôt been immune to these crises, either. The US began its foray into fiat currency with the issuance of Continental Currency in 1775. Just three years later, Continental Currency was worth less than 20% of its original value. 13 years later, hyperinflation entirely collapsed the currency, and the US had to pass a law guaranteeing that all future currencies would be backed by gold and silver, and that no unbacked currencies could be issued by any state.
In comparison, the early history of the US dollar makes the relative volatility of bitcoin in these first 9 years look like peanuts.
Once adopted out of necessity, the gold standard became part and parcel of US currency, just as it was with most other currencies from around the world. The gold standard removed some of the need to have pure faith in US dollars in of themselves, as it guaranteed that all paper money the US issued would be exchangeable at a fixed rate for gold upon demand.
Naturally, you still had to believe that the government would actually keep enough gold to fulfill all these demands (deÃÅjaÃÄ vu and foreshadowing, anyone? Any flashbacks to fractional reserve banking yet?), but it was certainly better than nothing.
Gold, unlike fiat currencies, requires no trust and faith in a government to responsibly manage its money supply and other financial dealings in order to believe that it will retain its value well over time. This is because gold has no central authority that controls it and effectively dictates its supply and creation arbitrarily. Gold is fundamentally scarce, and only a small amount of it can be mined every year and added to the whole net supply. To date, the estimated total of all the gold ever mined in the history of humankind is only 165,000 metric tons. To put that in perspective, all that gold wouldn‚Äôt even fill up 3.5 Olympic sized swimming pools.
No government, no matter how much they wanted to or needed to, could simply conjure up more gold on demand. Fiat currencies, on the other hand, can and often have been printed on demand by governments whenever they happened to be short on cash and needed a quick infusion.
This printing of more money generally leads to inflation, as the total value of all the money in existence rationally should stay the same, no matter how many dollars are printed. Hence, if more dollars are printed, each dollar is worth fractionally less of the total money supply.
In fact, governments design their currencies and monetary policies to inflate intentionally. This is why $100 US dollars in 1913 (when the government officially started tracking inflation rates) is equivalent to $2,470 dollars today, just over 100 years later.
In fact, the average inflation rate of the US dollar over that time period was about 3.22%. This seems low, but in reality means that prices double just every twenty years. In other words, your money becomes half as valuable if you keep it in US dollars every twenty years. Doesn‚Äôt seem ultra cool to me.
Gold, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt inflate like fiat currencies do. That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs an intrinsically limited supply, and consequently, things tend to cost the same in gold over long periods of time. In fact, 2,000 years ago, Roman centurions were paid about 38.58 ounces of gold. In US dollars today, this comes out to about $48,350. The base salary of a captain in the US army today comes out to just about the same at $48,500.
This makes gold, in many ways, a better store of value based on fundamental principles than fiat currencies over time. You don‚Äôt have to trust anyone to trust that your gold will retain its value relatively well across the sands of time.
Unfortunately, the gold standard collapsed multiple times during the 20th century and was ultimately abandoned altogether by almost every nation in the world, because governments effectively played fractional reserve banking with their gold reserves. Who could blame them? It must be irresistibly tempting, knowing that in all likelihood, the vast majority of the time, only a fraction of people will ever want to trade in their dollars for gold. Why hold all that gold when you could hold just a fraction of it and get to spend the rest with no consequences in the short term?
Inevitably, this caught up with each and every government over time. For the United States, the gold standard was suspended in the aftermath of the Great Depression. The Bretton Woods international agreement instituted in the aftermath of World War II restored the gold standard to the US dollar, but this was short lived.
Under the Bretton Woods system, numerous foreign governments held US dollars as an indirect and more convenient method of holding gold, as US dollars were supposedly directly exchangeable at a fixed rate for gold. However, by 1966, gold reserves actually held by the US were already pitifully low, with only $13.2 billion worth of gold being held by the government.
By 1971, other governments had caught on to this, and began demanding the exchange of all their US dollars for gold, as was promised to them. Naturally, the US had nowhere near enough gold to fulfill their promises, and this became a government version of the bank run, essentially.
The US chose instead to fully renege on their promised exchange rate, and announced in what was known as the Nixon shock that the US dollar would no longer be redeemable for gold, and would henceforth be backed solely by faith in the US government (very faith-inspiring, no?).
Almost every nation quickly followed suit, and since then, fiat currencies have been allowed free reign to grow as they please with no accountability whatsoever in how much a government chooses to expand their money supply.
This, thus, requires anyone holding fiat currencies to have extreme trust that their government will manage their money supply responsibly, and not make poor financial decisions that will severely devalue the currency they hold. This compounds with the trust one must hold in the banks in which one deposits their fiat currency, to create an ultimate monetary system that has multiple points of very real possible failure, as history has shown time and again.
Holding gold privately removes the need to trust either of these points of failure in the modern banking system, but comes with its own host of problems. Namely, while gold has proven to be an excellent store of value over time, it is incredibly poor for actual day to day use in the modern economy. To transact with gold is excessively cumbersome and inconvenient. No one would consider walking around with an ounce of gold on them, measuring and shaving off exact portions of gold to pay for a cup of coffee, groceries, or a bus ride. Worse, it‚Äôs even more difficult and time consuming to send gold to anyone who isn‚Äôt physically in the same exact location as you.
For these reasons among others, fiat currencies have traditionally been preferred for everyday use, despite their many shortcomings and associated inherent risks.
No solution to this tradeoff conundrum has heretofore been discovered, or even necessarily possible. Bitcoin, however, with the aid of recent technological advances (computers and the internet), solves all of these issues. It takes the best of both worlds, and puts it into one beautiful, elegant solution.
Holy long-windedness, batman! 2,700 words later, and we finally get to talking about bitcoin. I‚Äôm as relieved as you are. Remind me never to write again.
Bitcoin was designed, essentially, as a better ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô. It incorporates all of the best elements of gold ‚Äî its inherent scarcity and decentralized nature ‚Äî and then solves all the shortcomings of gold, in allowing it to be globally transactable in precise denominations extremely quickly.
How does it do this? In short, by emulating gold‚Äôs production digitally. Gold is physically mined out of the ground. Bitcoin is also ‚Äòmined‚Äô, but digitally. The production of bitcoin is controlled by code that dictates you must find a specific answer to a given problem in order to unlock new bitcoins.
In technical terms, bitcoin utilizes the same proof-of-work system that Hashcash devised in 1997. This system dictates that one must find an input that when hashed, creates an output with a specific number of preceding zeros, among a few other specific requirements.
This is where the ‚Äòcrypto‚Äô, incidentally, in cryptocurrency comes from. Cryptographic hash functions are fundamentally necessary for the functioning of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as they are one-way functions. One-way functions work such that it is easy to calculate an output given an input, but near impossible to calculate the original input given the output. Hence, cryptographic one-way hash functions enable bitcoin‚Äôs proof of work system, as it ensures that it is nigh-impossible for someone to just see the output required to unlock new bitcoins, and calculate in reverse the input that created that output.
Instead, one must essentially brute-force the solution, by trying every single possible input in order to find one that creates an output that satisfies the specified requirements.
Bitcoin is further ingeniously devised to guarantee that on average, new bitcoins are only found every 10 minutes or so. It guarantees this by ensuring that the code that dictates the new creation of bitcoin automatically increases the difficulty of the proof-of-work system in proportion to the number of computers trying to solve the problem at hand.
For instance, in the very beginning of time, it was only the creator of bitcoin who was mining for bitcoins. He used one computer to do so. For simplicity‚Äôs sake, let‚Äôs assume this one computer could try 1000 different values to hash a second. In a minute, it would hash 60,000 values, and in 10 minutes, 600,000 values.
The algorithm that dictates the mining of bitcoins, therefore, would ensure that on average, it would take 600,000 random tries of hashing values to find one that would fulfill the requirements of the specified output required to unlock the next block of bitcoins.
It can do this by making the problem more or less difficult, by requiring more or less zeros at the beginning of the output that solves the problem. The more zeros that are required at the beginning of the output, the more exponentially difficult the problem becomes to solve. To understand why this is, click here for a reasonably good explanation.
In this case, it would require just the right amount of leading zeros and other characters to ensure that a solution is found on average every 600,000 or so tries.
However, imagine now that a new computer joins the network, and this one too can compute 1000 hashes a second. This effectively doubles the rate at which the problem can be solved, because now on average 600,000 hashes are tried every 5 minutes, not 10.
Bitcoin‚Äôs code elegantly solves this problem by ensuring that every 2,016 times new bitcoin is mined (roughly every 14 days at 10 minutes per block), the difficulty adjusts to become proportional to how much more or less hashing power is mining for bitcoin, such that on average new bitcoin continues to be found roughly every ten minutes or so.
You can see the present difficulty of mining bitcoin here. It should be evident from a half-second glance that the amount of computing power working to mine bitcoin right now is immense, and the difficulty is proportionally similarly immense. As of the time of this writing right now, there are close to 5 billion billion hashes per second being run to try to find the next block of bitcoin.
This system holds a lot of advantages even over gold‚Äôs natural system of being mined out of the ground. Gold‚Äôs mining is effectively random and not dictated by any perfect computer algorithm, and is consequently much more unpredictable in its output at any given moment. If a huge supply of gold is serendipitously found somewhere, it could theoretically dramatically inflate the rate at which gold enters the existing supply, and consequently cause an unanticipated decrease in the unit price of gold.
This isn‚Äôt just theoretical ‚Äî it‚Äôs the reality of gold production. This graph illustrates vividly the fact that gold production has been dramatically increasing over time, and is today over four times higher than just a hundred years ago.
In fact, more than half of all the gold that has ever been mined in the history of humankind has been mined in just the past 50 years. The difficulty of mining gold doesn‚Äôt proportionally increase with the number of people mining it, or with technological innovations that make it significantly easier to locate and mine gold over time.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, will always be mined on a carefully regulated schedule, because it can perfectly adapt no matter how many people begin to mine it or how technologically advanced bitcoin mining hardware becomes.
In fact, it‚Äôs already known for certain that there will only ever be a total of 21 million bitcoins in the world.
This is because the amount of bitcoin that is mined every time a hash problem is solved and a new block is created halves every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every 4 years.
The initial reward per block used to be 50 bitcoins back in 2009. After about four years, this dropped to 25 bitcoins in late 2012. The last halving occurred in July 2016, and dropped the reward per block mined to 12.5. In 2020, this should go down to 6.25, in 2024, 3.125, and so forth, all the way until the reward drops to essentially zero.
When all is said and done, there will hence be 21 million bitcoins. Exactly that, no more, no less. Elegant, no? This eliminates yet another risk with extant currencies, gold included: there are absolutely no surprises when it comes to knowing the present and future supply of bitcoin. A million bitcoin will never be found randomly in California one day and incite a digital gold rush.
On top of this, bitcoin is trivially divisible to any arbitrary degree. Presently, the smallest unit of bitcoin is known as a satoshi, and is one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 bitcoins = 1 satoshi).
This means that unlike gold, bitcoin is perfectly suited to not only being an inflation-proof store of value, but also a day-to-day transactable currency as well, as it is easily divisible to any arbitrary amount. You can buy a cup of coffee with it just as easily as you can buy a car.
Moreover, bitcoin can be sent incredibly quickly and remotely over the internet to anyone anywhere in the world. This is because when bitcoin is mined, the miners are actually providing a service in powering the bitcoin network.
What happens when a miner mines bitcoin is actually that they add a ‚Äòblock‚Äô to what is known as the ‚Äòblockchain‚Äô. The blockchain is a ledger that contains a record of every transaction ever made with bitcoins since its inception. When someone decides to mine bitcoin, they must download the entire blockchain as it presently stands.
Then, when they successfully find a solution to the next hash problem and mine a block of bitcoins, something magical happens. They get to add the block they just mined to the end of the existing blockchain ‚Äî and with it, they include every transaction that was initiated on the bitcoin network since the last block was mined. They then propagate this block they just created to the rest of the network of bitcoin miners, who all then update their own blockchains with this new block, and begin working on solving the next hash problem.
As a reward for providing this valuable service, miners are allowed to add a single transaction to the beginning of the block they mined, called the ‚Äòcoinbase transaction‚Äô. This transaction contains the brand new bitcoin that was created when they mined the block, and allows the miner to claim this bitcoin for themselves.
At this point, a particularly shrewd reader might become concerned with the fact that the reward for mining a new block of bitcoin gradually shrinks to zero. Won‚Äôt this cause miners to stop mining bitcoin, and consequently to stop providing the invaluable service that allows the bitcoin network to function and for transactions to be sent?
The answer is no, because miners are not solely rewarded by the new bitcoin that is generated each time they mine a block. Users may also send a transaction fee along with their transactions, which is paid out to any miner who decides to include their transaction in a block they mine. Over time, as the bitcoin network becomes used for more and more transactions, it is expected that transaction fees will be more than sufficient for incentivizing enough miners to continue mining blocks to keep the bitcoin network safe, secure, and robust.
It‚Äôs important that enough miners keep trying to mine blocks because this is another valuable service miners provide the network. Bitcoin, like gold, is powerful as a store of value because it is decentralized and trustless. There is no one central authority who holds all the power over bitcoin, just like no central authority holds power over gold.
No one person or government can decide to conjure up more bitcoin on demand, or to take it away. The only way the rules that govern bitcoin can be changed is if the software bitcoin miners run to mine bitcoin is changed.
Technically, any bitcoin miner could decide to change the software they run to mine bitcoin at any time. However, this still doesn‚Äôt have any impact on changing bitcoin itself. What it would do is cause a ‚Äòhard fork‚Äô, or a divergence in the block chain.
This occurs because any block that the rogue miner who changed their software mines won‚Äôt be accepted by all the other miners who are still running the original software. Consequently, all the other miners will begin mining different blocks, and adding those to their blockchain. This leads to a fork in the road, essentially, where two completely different blockchains are formed ‚Äî one by the rogue miner, and one by all the other miners.
Everything up to the point of the software change remains the same in both blockchains, but after that change, the blockchains diverge. Once diverged, they can never be reconciled and remerged.
This isn‚Äôt a concern, however, because the bitcoin network runs on consensus, and accepts whichever blockchain is the longest. In practice, this means that whichever blockchain has the most computing power behind it is effectively guaranteed to win, as they‚Äôll be able to calculate the solutions to the hash problems and find new blocks faster than their less powerful competitors.
This does mean that in theory, bitcoin is vulnerable to what‚Äôs known as a 51% attack ‚Äî an attack in which if a single entity was able to gain control of at least 51% of the total hashing power being directed at bitcoin mining, it could outpace a legitimate blockchain and temporarily take control of the network.
This is an extraordinarily difficult feat to accomplish, however, as the more people there are mining bitcoin, the harder it is to take over the network. At the current worldwide mining rate of almost 5 billion gigahashes a second, it would be extraordinarily difficult for even the most powerful organizations in the world (e.g., large-scale governments) to mount a successful 51% attack. It would be enormously costly, and quite possibly more financially detrimental to the attacker than to the network.
Indeed, the only thing a 51% attacker could really accomplish is destroying collective faith in bitcoin. They couldn‚Äôt somehow steal and gain all the value of bitcoins for itself. The attacker wouldn‚Äôt be able to generate new bitcoins on demand arbitrarily, and would still have to mine for them. They also would have no control over taking bitcoins created in the past that didn‚Äôt belong to them. The only thing they could do, really, is repeatedly spend bitcoin they already owned again and again, but even this is limited in its value, because ‚Äòhonest‚Äô miner nodes would never accept these fraudulent payments.
Hence, no rationally self-interested bitcoin miner would ever try to mount a 51% attack, as in all likelihood, they would lose massive amounts of money doing so and gain almost nothing from the effort. The only reason someone would want to conduct a 51% attack is to attempt to destroy faith in bitcoin ‚Äî large governments, for instance, who might one day feel that their fiat currencies that presently provide them great value to them are becoming threatened by bitcoin. However, the likelihood even of these enormous entities to successfully conduct a 51% attack is already becoming vanishingly small, as mining power increases.
Thus, bitcoin has perfectly utilized recent technological advances to create something heretofore impossible: an extremely safe, reliable, decentralized, and globally transactable digital and better version of gold, and possibly of all types of extant currency at large.
The advantages don‚Äôt stop there, however. Bitcoin is also ‚Äòpseudonymous‚Äô, meaning that while all transactions ever conducted on the network are public and known by all as everything is recorded in the blockchain, unless someone knows who owns the bitcoins that are being used in these transactions, there is no way to trace those bitcoins and transactions back to a given person or entity.
This serves a dual purpose of both allowing extreme transparency when desired in making transactions, and also allowing a lot of anonymity when desired. If one wants to ensure that they have perfect undeniable proof of their transactions, all they have to do is prove they own certain bitcoins, and then any and all transactions conducted with those bitcoins are undeniably theirs and most certainly occurred.
If one wants, rather, to keep the movement of their money less overt, one simply needs to ensure that the bitcoins they own are never tied to their identities, and that their transactions on the network are obfuscated. This can be accomplished with a variety of methods, such as using a tumbler, which allows one to send bitcoins to an intermediary service that will mix these bitcoins with bitcoins from numerous other sources, and then send bitcoins forward to the intended destination from sources entirely unrelated to the sender‚Äôs original bitcoins.
To clarify this a bit more, bitcoins are stored at what are known as ‚Äòaddresses‚Äô. Think of this as an email address or a mailing address. These addresses allow for the storage, sending, and receiving of bitcoin. The blockchain ledger contains a complete record of the movement of bitcoins from one address to another.
A tumbler allows someone who say, wants to move bitcoins from address 10 to address 100, to instead move their bitcoins from address 10 to a totally random address, say 57. In some other transaction, the tumbler has accepted bitcoins from someone entirely unrelated at say, address 20, who wanted to send the coins ultimately to 200 and sent these instead to another completely random address 42. It then sends the coins stored at address 42 from sender 2 to the address sender 1 originally desired, 100, and sends the coins stored at address 57 from sender 1 to the address sender 2 desired, 200.
This is highly simplified, but effectively how a tumbler works, albeit at much larger scale, and with many more senders and receivers of all sorts of varying amounts.
This ability to transact more anonymously in a digital, global fashion than ever before has indeed opened the gateway to some of bitcoin‚Äôs more infamous use cases. Much illicit activity has been enabled by this pseudonymity of bitcoin, including the sale of drugs and other illegal goods online. A more recent development has also been ransomware, whereby malware can now cut straight to the chase and lock up your computer and demand straight up money in the form of bitcoin in exchange for the release of your computer‚Äôs data.
These developments have been enabled not only by bitcoin‚Äôs pseudonymity, but also the irrevocability of transactions. Unlike current forms of digital payment, such as credit cards and bank transfers, bitcoin transactions are irreversible and do not involve any middleman who can mediate between disputes.
This has its disadvantages, but also its advantages, and was indeed one of the primary benefits the creator of bitcoin (a pseudonymous as-of-yet unidentified figure himself, Satoshi Nakamoto) outlined in the bitcoin white paper. In his own words:
As Satoshi notes, bitcoin‚Äôs irreversible, trustless nature removes the need for any middlemen to mediate and broker the process of payments from one person to another. Middlemen (e.g. banks and credit card networks) inherently introduce overhead costs and inefficiency into the system, which make transactions ‚Äî and micropayments in particular ‚Äî more costly than would otherwise be the case.
Fraud is also inherently eliminated, as any transaction propagated and confirmed by the bitcoin network by 6 or more blocks is generally accepted to be impossible to ever revoke.
Trustlessness in this sense is a huge component and advantage of bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large. Another ground-breaking innovation the blockchain introduces is the concept of a smart contract, or a contract that similarly requires no trust or middleman to mediate, but is rather contractually executed in a deterministic fashion through code run on the blockchain.
Traditionally, with a legal contract, two parties agree to certain terms with the understanding that if one party reneges, the other party can seek legal recourse with the governmental justice system. Lawsuits, however, can often be inordinately expensive, and in many cases the outcome is far from certain. A good or bad lawyer can make or break a case, and one is also at the mercy of a judge and/or jury and their subjective, possibly mercurial whims. Not the most efficient or foolproof system.
A contract written with and enforced by code, however, removes the need to trust a third party arbitrator (such as a court system), in much the same way that transactions enforced by bitcoin‚Äôs code remove the need to trust a third party financial institution. The code is written in such a way that clearly specifies the conditions of the contract, and will automatically enforce these conditions.
For instance, if two parties decide to make a bet on Donald Trump winning the election, historically, this could only be done by either word of honor or by some ad hoc legal contract. For a say, small $100 bet, it would be absolutely a non-starter to pursue legal action in the case that one of the parties decided to renege on the deal in the aftermath of the election. Normally, the reneged-upon party would simply be left in the dust without recourse.
With the advent of smart contracts made possible by the blockchain, however, this is (soon-to-be) a thing of the past. One can create a simple smart contract at effectively almost no cost that specifies in code that each party will send it $100 in bitcoin, and that upon the completion of the election process, it will either send all $200 to the party that bet on Donald Trump winning the election, or send the $200 to the party that bet on him losing the election. No ifs, ands, or buts. The code is clear, objective, and deterministic. Either the contract is fulfilled in one direction, or it is fulfilled in the other. No need to trust the other party in the bet at all, much less a third party to mediate.
Ethereum, as will be noted later (hopefully in another article because my god I never want to write again), takes this concept to the next level and runs with it.
One further benefit to bitcoin is that it is truly yours to own, and you can keep it yourself, without the need for a bank or any other intermediary, and use it just as easily as you might a credit card. This ensures that you won‚Äôt fall victim to a banking system collapse brought on by fractional reserve banking or irresponsible government and financial institution fiscal policies in general. It also ensures, however, that no one can take your money from you even on an individual basis, global financial apocalypse aside.
This, like systemic banking failures, is not something most people generally have to worry about 99% of the time. However, in the 1% of cases where this does become an issue, it becomes a very serious issue. Refugees and other victims of persecution and oppression are clear examples of this.
As a refugee, generally, if you hope to escape with your money, you have to carry it in physical form on you, either in gold or in paper currency. This is limiting for a few reasons: one, you can only take so much as you can carry or convert to physical form, and two, physical currencies are exceedingly simple to detect and confiscate.
Again, while this all seems incredibly far-fetched today for most people (but not all, as the present day European migrant crisis has made abundantly clear), it happens much more often than one might expect. A little remembered fact is that the United States itself once outlawed the possession of gold, back in 1933 with Executive Order 6102, and forced all its citizens to relinquish all gold to the United States at a fixed price of $20.67 per troy ounce.
Immediately thereafter, the US Treasury revalued all their gold at $35 per troy ounce for foreign transactions, and in the process reaped an enormous profit at the expense of all the citizens that were forced to give up their gold at fire sale prices.
It sounds incredible, but this is real life. The government threatened to fine anyone caught possessing gold in violation of this order $10,000 ($185,000 today) and throw them in jail for up to ten years. A famous case involved one Frederick Barber Campbell, who had on deposit at Chase Bank over 5,000 ounces of gold (worth over $6 million today), and attempted to withdraw the gold that he rightfully owned. Chase refused to allow him to do so, so he decided to sue Chase for depriving him of his assets.
In response to his lawsuit (this case demonstrates the value of basically everything about bitcoin, from the ability to store your own money to the ability to not rely on the legal system for recourse), Campbell was counterattacked and indicted by a federal prosecutor, and had to defend himself in court for not giving up his gold.
Ultimately, while Campbell didn‚Äôt end up going to jail, the government did decide to seize all his gold, and confiscated all $6 million worth of gold from him.
It took a full 40 years, or until 1974, before Gerald Ford signed a bill making it once again legal for private individuals and corporations to own gold within the United States.
This underscores the oft mercurial whims of governments, even well-regarded ones like that of the United States, that most citizens heretofore have been subject to without relief or alternative. Most of the time, things run well enough that we all get by without having to think about this fact too much. Sometimes, however, things do go really, really wrong.
Bitcoin fundamentally changes this equation. Unlike even gold, bitcoin is nigh impossible, when stored correctly, for anyone to confiscate without consent. The addresses at which bitcoin values are stored are protected by ‚Äòprivate keys‚Äô, which can be thought of as a password or a key to a lockbox. Without this private key, it is generally impossible to steal the bitcoins held at the public address to which the private key corresponds. So long as you keep this private key secure, your bitcoins are secure.
With things like brain wallets possible, this means that even in the worst case scenario, you can literally store your bitcoins in your brain and nowhere else, and thereby easily prevent their confiscation. Just yet another fundamental innovation in the evolution of currency that bitcoin has made possible ‚Äî its fully intangible nature is actually an asset.
The intangibility of bitcoin, however, does seem to hang some people up. It‚Äôs sometimes difficult to immediately conceive of how bitcoins could possibly hold value, as these people contend, when they are intrinsically worthless. They are nothing but a concept, backed up by some computer code. Gold is a physical, tangible object that you can hold in your hand. It has real uses in industry and as jewelry that lend it value. Even paper money can be used for kindling or toilet paper if the need necessitates.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is fully intangible. It is just a concept backed by code, no more, no less. It can‚Äôt be used for anything functional besides being transferred in concept to other people as a store of value. How could something like this possibly hold value like other existing currencies?
It‚Äôs a good question, and one that underscores just how interesting the concept of money really is, and how rarely we actually think critically about it.
Sure, let‚Äôs say that you can‚Äôt compare bitcoin to gold and say it‚Äôs better because gold has tangible, real-world utility and bitcoin doesn‚Äôt.
What is the value of that real-world utility? Only about 12% of gold purchased every year is actually used for industrial and medical purposes. If this is truly where gold‚Äôs value is derived from, gold would be worth dramatically less than it actually is.
To the other point, gold‚Äôs coveted status in jewelry is merely a derivative property of its perceived value, which leads to its designation as a status symbol. Without that underlying perceived value, it would command far less value in jewelry. Consequently, the question still remains about the gap between the industrial and medical value of gold and the actual value of gold as determined by the market. Where does the value in that gap come from?
This is even more true of paper currency. Yes, you can utilize and reuse the paper for all the intrinsic value paper has. But what is that intrinsic value of paper? This is easy to answer, because we can just see how much the government pays to make paper money. $1 and $2 bills cost less than 5 cents to make on the low end of the spectrum, while $100 bills cost 12.3 cents on the high end.
Even the $1 bill, which seems to be the best deal if one is valuing the worth of one‚Äôs currency based on its intrinsic ‚Äòtangible‚Äô value, has only ~5 cents worth of actual paper value behind it, or <5% of its actual denominated value. Where does the rest of that 95 cents of value come from?
It turns out these gaps in value between the worth of the ‚Äòtangible‚Äô thing itself and the actual value of the currency as it stands on the market today is just as much conjured up out of thin air as a mere concept as bitcoin‚Äôs perceived value is.
This ‚Äòintangible‚Äô worth that we ascribe to currency, which accounts for the vast majority of the value of all currencies, not just bitcoin, is ultimately what makes money work. Yuval Noah Harari captures this fact very well in Sapiens, where he lays out the case that the value of a given form of money is essentially an indication of trust in that form of money. It is our shared collective trust and belief in a currency that gives it value, not its intrinsic tangible utility or anything else.
Gold holds its value well because we trust that we will all collectively continue to trust it as a store of value forever, predominantly due to its scarcity and lack of centralized control. Fiat currencies hold their value well when they do because people trust that everyone else trusts the currency as well, and that it is deserving of trust. The moment that collective trust collapses, so too does the currency, no matter what its intrinsic ‚Äòtangible‚Äô value.
This is why no fiat currency has ever stood the test of time over a long enough timescale, whereas gold has to date always stood the test of time and retained its value well. Collective trust for gold has never collapsed because of its inherent scarcity and immunity to the vicissitudes fiat currencies must endure at the hands of capricious centralized governing powers, whereas collective trust in every historical fiat currency has inevitably failed to date, and collective trust in many present-day fiat currencies continues to fail as we speak.
With this in mind, bitcoin can arguably be seen as the purest form of money, as its value is entirely predicated on trust in it, and nothing else. It can arguably also be seen as the most trustworthy of currencies, as it was bespoke made by intentional design to exhibit all the best elements of historically trustworthy currencies (e.g. gold), as well as to introduce for the first time a number of characteristics that make it even better than all previously extant currencies.
If people have trusted gold to date as a store of value because of its inherent scarcity and resistance to centralized control and price/supply manipulation, bitcoin does all that and more, and does it all better. Gold‚Äôs scarcity, as illustrated above, is anything but constant, and we‚Äôve more than doubled our world‚Äôs supply of gold in just the last 50 years. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a precisely and publicly known proliferation schedule, and will approach the limit of its supply in just a few more decades.
As a thought exercise, imagine a new fledgling nation called the United States came into formation and decided to create their own fiat currency today. At the same time, bitcoin is introduced as a currency.
Which would you trust? My personal bet would be absolutely, wholly, and unequivocally bitcoin. With the new US currency, I would be effectively required to trust that the US government would act without fail over the entire course of its indefinite existence to practice perfect fiscally responsible habits and not screw up its economy in any dramatic ways. I would also be aware that even under perfect circumstances, the currency would be fundamentally designed to inflate, and consequently my money would continue to lose value over time if I decided to hold and save it.
Furthermore, I would be forced to use an intermediary financial institution such as a bank to hold my money for me, and thereby expose myself to yet another layer of required trust and accompanying risk. I would also be aware that these institutions would almost certainly practice fractional reserve banking to the maximum extent they could get away with it, such that they would be extremely fragile to small perturbations and vulnerable to things like bank runs and runaway systemic banking collapses.
On the other hand, with bitcoin, I wouldn‚Äôt have to trust anyone at all. I would know for certain that my coins wouldn‚Äôt lose their value due to inflation as a consequence of their designed and indelible scarcity. I would also know that as I stored my coins myself, no one else, not even a bank, could actually go and spend 90% of my money, and fail to give it back to me in the event of a bank run. Furthermore, no one could forcibly confiscate my money under any circumstances, as I could always store it in such a way that it could never be retrieved except with my consent. No one would even necessarily be able to know how much money I held, unless I chose to make that information public.
Remember: just 13 years after its inception, the US currency had already suffered fatal runaway inflation and collapsed. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is worth more than ever just 9 years after its inception, and currently boasts a market cap of over $40 billion. Which would you trust?
The other common argument against bitcoin is that it is useless for any real world functions right now besides ransomware and illegal activities, and is therefore worthless because it has no good use cases.
This is a fundamentally flawed argument that can be lobbied against absolutely any new technology or invention, and fails to take into account the natural process of growth and gradual adoption over time. The exact same argument was used against the internet in its early days, and I find this article from Newsweek, published in 1995, particularly illuminating in this regard.
What‚Äôs striking in this is that while everything he said at the time was true, and certainly none of those things were particularly possible back in 1995, it all came to pass eventually. Today, remote workers are a huge part of the global workforce. Online education is booming. Amazon is taking over all of commerce and is larger than any retail store in the world. Print newspapers and magazines are dying left and right, replaced by a proliferation of online news.
The same growth trajectory is how I see bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology at large playing out. If all goes well ‚Äî and there‚Äôs no guarantee it might, everything indeed might fail and all our hopes and dreams might gang aft agley ‚Äî there‚Äôs no reason at all that bitcoin can‚Äôt one day surpass even our wildest imaginations today, just like the internet did before it, and fundamentally rewrite the script for how we interact with money and the world as a whole.
Yes, today, it is far from this goal, but even now, we make progress in pushing forward the utility of bitcoin in every day pragmatic life. Already, it has proved indispensable to myself and hundreds of thousands of people around the world. I pay many of my employees today in bitcoin, even, because several of them live in Eastern Europe where they‚Äôre subject to draconian capital controls.
Were I to send them a wire (as I used to), their banks demand a mountain of documentation detailing every last dollar and hold their money for upwards of half a month before ultimately releasing it to them. Naturally, this is a pain in the ass and highly inefficient, time consuming, and resource intensive for all of us. Bitcoin easily sidesteps all of these issues.
Bitcoin is also dramatically cheaper to use than almost any other form of international money transfer today. Already, for this use case alone, it proves its worth over current dominant international money transfer solutions, such as Western Union. I can transfer money to anyone in the world, in any amount, and have them receive it without moving a finger in just a few minutes. For this privilege, I have to pay just a few cents, no matter how much I‚Äôm sending, instead of a huge proportional percentage, with hefty minimum fees and surcharges.
It‚Äôs also extremely convenient and valuable for a merchant to use, and we had great success implementing it for a trial run at my company Sprayable back in the day. In the past, we‚Äôve suffered from rampant fraud after our site was targeted on a carding forum (a place where people buy and sell and use stolen credit cards). When we were paid in bitcoin, however, these concerns were completely eliminated, as fraud is an impossibility on the bitcoin network with enough confirmations.
This is only the beginning. You don‚Äôt expect a horse to become a world champion racer straight from the womb. It takes time, training, and a fair bit of luck. The same is true of bitcoin and blockchain technology. But just because a horse may not be a world champion just quite yet, it doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt bet on that horse in the long run. If you see potential in that horse, and are willing to wait it out for the long run, go ahead, bet on that horse. One day, it might just take over the world, and if it does, you might just win big.
Okay ‚Äî now that you hopefully have a good grasp of what cryptocurrency is and why it‚Äôs interesting, we can move on to dipping your fingers in getting some.
We can all be honest ‚Äî the reason the vast majority of you are reading this is probably because you‚Äôve heard a lot about just how much money people have made investing in cryptocurrency. Many, if not all of you, are wondering how you, too, can get on the gravy train and start making millions.
This isn‚Äôt necessarily wrong, or inaccurate. This is the reason I first started paying attention to bitcoin. Countless people *have* made shocking amounts of money investing in cryptocurrency. I‚Äôve personally made over $400,000 in less than two years. In fact, bitcoin has already proven to be the best investment in all of recorded history by a shocking margin for those who got in at its most early stages.
Here‚Äôs a story about a completely random Norwegian student who bought 5000 bitcoins for $27 back in 2009. Today, with a single bitcoin pushing past $2700, those 5000 bitcoins are worth over $13.5 million. That‚Äôs a gain of over 500,000X. No other investment in recorded history that I‚Äôve been able to discover has ever come close to touching these sorts of gains.
Even the Dutch tulip bubble, which is classically regarded as one of the first instances of massive speculative market mania, saw increases only on the magnitude of 10‚Äì100X ‚Äî not even remotely close to 100,000X+. And even the most successful of extremely risky angel investments in companies, such as Peter Thiel‚Äôs initial $500,000 seed investment in Facebook, see returns on the scale of 10,000X or so or less ‚Äî Thiel‚Äôs $500,000 investment, had he held it all the way to the present day, would be worth $6.8 billion, or approximately a ~13,500X gain. More incredible than just about anything else, certainly, but still nowhere even near Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise in price.
What‚Äôs also striking is that traditionally, these sorts of ‚Äòangel or seed‚Äô investments in new technologies have been closed off to all but an incredibly well connected inner circle of elite high net-worth individuals and institutions. Peter Thiel, for instance, was only approached to become Facebook‚Äôs first outside investor because he was already incredibly well known within Silicon Valley for having founded and sold PayPal for over a billion dollars. In contrast, with bitcoin, a random student in Norway was able to invest just $27 and make millions.
That said, just as with everything, there‚Äôs survivorship bias here. What you don‚Äôt hear about are the profusion of people who lost their entire fortunes investing in cryptocurrency. While there are a few ways you can beat all the odds and come out vastly ahead in cryptocurrency, there are infinitely more ways you can lose everything you put into it and end up in a much worse place than where you started.
Here, I‚Äôll try to cover the most common ‚Äòmistakes‚Äô people have made. Do keep in mind that this is all entirely my own opinion. Please come to your own conclusions here.
The most common mistake people seem to make is investing solely based on the price alone and its short term historical trajectory, and nothing else. The second mistake is investing in assets that they don‚Äôt actually understand or believe in long term, are not planning to hold for at least 5 years, and will be tempted to sell if the price begins to fall in the short term. The third mistake is believing that they‚Äôve already missed the boat on the most established and successful cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ethereum, and that consequently they should invest in much less established, much more speculative ‚Äòaltcoins‚Äô to achieve truly outsized gains, for no truly good reason besides the fact that the price/market cap for the altcoin is a lot lower than bitcoin‚Äôs, and seems like it has more room to grow. The fourth mistake is day trading, and trying to capitalize on short term market movements. I‚Äôll address each of these in turn, and why I believe them to be mistakes.
On the first mistake ‚Äî I made this mistake myself when I first got into cryptocurrency. I first heard about bitcoin from a friend who was raving that we should all get into it just around the time the price of a single bitcoin reached $100. He had gotten in at $30, and was extremely pleased with his gains.
At the time, it was relatively big news that bitcoin had reached $100. I remember thinking to myself that it was clearly too late to get in, and promptly forgot all about bitcoin.
The next time I heard about bitcoin was in the fall of 2013, when it began its last truly meteoric price rise from $100 all the way up to $1200. This time around, I distinctly remembered thinking I‚Äôd missed the boat back when the price was just $100, and kicked myself for being totally wrong. I resolved to not make the same mistake again, and tried to get in before I missed out again.
I ended up wiring several thousand dollars to an incredibly sketchy Russian exchange, BTC-E.com, to purchase my first few bitcoins at around $1000 apiece. Before I knew it, I was addicted to constantly checking the price, and spent a full 48 hours doing nothing at the height of the November 2013 bubble doing nothing but refreshing BTC-E.com and seeing how my investments were doing.
I ended up making another big mistake here too, and figured that bitcoin had already gone up way too much, and that my best bet was to invest in some smaller altcoins as well. I made this decision after seeing litecoin (LTC) skyrocket from $4 to $40 in just a few days. The buzz at the time was that litecoin would be to silver what bitcoin was to gold. The price seemed incredibly low compared to bitcoin, and this made a superficial sort of sense (meaning, no sense at all), so I decided to jump in. For good measure, I also decided to jump into a few of the other most popular altcoins of the time ‚Äî peercoin (PPC) and namecoin (NMC).
The 2013 cryptocurrency bubble burst just a few days later, brought on by the collapse of Mt Gox, the largest bitcoin trading exchange at the time. It was revealed that Mt Gox had either been hacked or embezzled from, and no longer had any funds left to honor customer withdrawals. As a result, anyone who had decided to keep their bitcoins in Mt Gox at the time instead of withdrawing them to their own wallets ended up losing all their money. How much the price of bitcoin rises doesn‚Äôt mean anything if you lose all your bitcoins, unfortunately.
The price of bitcoin cratered about 80%, falling all the way to about $200, before stabilizing at that price for much of 2014 and 2015. Litecoin, on the other hand, fell from over $45 to about $1, and consequently lost over 97.5% of its value. PPC and NMC suffered so badly that I didn‚Äôt even bother to calculate how much I had lost, because it was basically everything.
This is when I first saw the light, and realized that investing in altcoins that I didn‚Äôt really believe in, and that didn‚Äôt really have any truly compelling reasons they would ever overtake bitcoin or deserve any level of market share, was an incredibly foolish move. It was certainly true that these altcoins did often gain on bitcoin and appreciated far more rapidly in many cases while the bubble held strong, but the moment it began to collapse, the altcoins were the first to go, and often fell all the way to zero.
As a general rule, what goes up can come down, and what goes up particularly quickly is privy to come down just as quickly. This is not to say that things will come down if they go up, but merely that they can, and certainly have before. This is particularly noteworthy today, with ethereum having seen some truly wild gains this year, all the way up from $7 back in December of last year to over $350 presently ‚Äî a gain of 50X in just about half a year. Again, this isn‚Äôt to say ethereum will fall, but merely that it very well might, for any host of reasons, and it‚Äôs very important to keep this fact in mind and not overextend yourself with investments you perceive to be less volatile than they truly are. I‚Äôll get back to this more later.
What I ended up learning was something the smartest people in the investment world had learned a long time ago. Benjamin Graham, the mentor of Warren Buffett, who became the richest man in the world by practicing the principle of value investing, has a pretty wonderful analogy that I think is worth repeating here. You should buy your stocks (or any investment, generally) like you buy your groceries ‚Äî not like you buy your perfume.
What he means by that is that for some reason, people tend to buy stocks when they‚Äôre going up in price, and sell them when they‚Äôre going down. At face value, this makes no sense. We wouldn‚Äôt buy a watermelon when it was $10, and sell it when it was $2. With groceries, it makes intrinsic sense to us to buy watermelons at $2, not $10, but seemingly not so with our investments.
The short term price movements of a stock shouldn‚Äôt concern a long term value investor in the slightest, as a value investor doesn‚Äôt care about what the market has valued the price of a stock at, but rather only about the intrinsic value of the business behind the stock, and its future potential value. Only after coming to a conclusion about the actual value of a company and its future potential value, should an investor then look to what price the market has assigned a stock, in ascertaining whether or not a stock is a good purchase.
In the case of a watermelon, what we intuitively grasp is that there is some fundamental, intrinsic value to the watermelon, and a ‚Äòfair‚Äô price for it. We have a general understanding of what this price should be, and are more than happy to buy watermelons when they are on discount relative to their fair price, and are reticent to do so when they are being sold at a premium to their fair price.
If we decide that a watermelon‚Äôs fair intrinsic value is $6, then we‚Äôd be happy to buy watermelons all day long at $2, and reticent to do so at $10.
With investments, it‚Äôs the same deal. If we decide that Company X is presently worth $100,000 dollars, and that it has strong growth potential in the future, and the market is presently valuing Company X at $50,000, that would probably be a good buy.
On the other hand, if we decide Company X is worth $100,000, and has ambiguous future potential, and the market is presently valuing it at $200,000, it might not be such a good buy.
In a third case, if we decide Company X is worth $100,000 today, and has extremely strong growth potential, and the market is valuing it at $100,000 today, it might still be a good buy to hold and capitalize on that future potential.
In all of these cases, however, a value investor first and foremost must decide, with rigorous analysis and thorough examination, what they believe the fair value of an investment to be, and what degree of future potential it has. Only from there do they then examine what value the market has assigned the investment, in order to ascertain whether or not the investment is a wise one likely to yield good returns. Under no circumstances should one ever buy into a stock without knowing much, or anything at all about the stock, save for the general market sentiment or hype surrounding it, and its short term price movements. Buying a stock merely because it has seen great gains in the past, without any understanding of why it saw those gains and what gains it might expect to see in the future based on fundamental analysis of the stock, is an inordinately risky and foundationally bereft strategy.
If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about value investing at large, I‚Äôd highly recommend The Intelligent Investor, by Benjamin Graham, who again was Warren Buffett‚Äôs personal mentor and a professor of economics at Columbia University. He pioneered a lot of the foundational concepts around value investing, and can give you much better and more nuanced advice than I ever could.
All of this said, while these principles can and should be kept in mind at large for just about any investment, cryptocurrencies are dramatically different from stocks, bonds, or any other sort of traditional investment vehicle. They‚Äôre also so early stage and so volatile that it‚Äôs a near-certainty that a value investor like Benjamin Graham wouldn‚Äôt even dream of labeling such opportunities as investments, rather than speculations (at best, they would be labeled growth investments, but I‚Äôm working with the Buffett philosophy that there is no difference between ‚Äòvalue‚Äô and ‚Äògrowth‚Äô investing, and that good value investing appropriately takes into account growth).
Investments, under this distinction, would be clarified as things that could generally be safely assured not to suffer from dramatic, catastrophic losses in the absence of dramatic, catastrophic situations. Coca-Cola and Walmart might be considered investments. They‚Äôve been around for well over a century and a half century respectively, are massive, mature companies with a healthy track record of stable, non-volatile growth, and show no general signs of turmoil that might portend a sudden collapse in value.
Speculations, on the other hand, are like the Wild West of opportunities. They‚Äôre extremely high risk, extremely volatile, and could on one hand multiply one‚Äôs principal manyfold, and on the other, dissipate it all into thin air. A seed ‚Äòinvestment‚Äô in Facebook, for instance, could be considered a speculation. In the vast majority of cases, such an investment is likely to fail outright and lose all of the money invested. In a few instances, however, that investment just might succeed, and return tens, hundreds, or even thousands of times the principal invested.
It‚Äôs important to note that the mere fact that something is speculative does not necessarily mean it can‚Äôt be a good investment, or that it is merely akin to blind gambling, dependent solely on the luck of the draw. Poker might be a suitable analogy. Poker can be played well or poorly, and skill and calculation lends an incredible degree of advantage to a player‚Äôs odds of success. However, the game still fundamentally deals with an immense degree of unavoidable variation and unknowns, and even the best poker player is guaranteed to lose many of their games, even if they play each one ‚Äòperfectly‚Äô. The goal, simply, is to win more than you lose, and with the right amount of skill, knowledge, and preparation, this is a possible feat in poker.
The same might be said of speculative investments such as those in cryptocurrency. You can and absolutely should do your part to learn as much as possible about this field, and come to your own personal conclusions on its current and future potential value. However, no matter how much research you do and how many calculations you make, there will always be a fundamental and inextricable degree of pure luck involved in determining the ultimate outcome of your speculation. Any number of future events could tip the scales for or against cryptocurrency, or more specifically, any one cryptocurrency, and a number of these will be ‚Äòblack swan‚Äô events that are fundamentally unpredictable in their nature and timing, but in aggregate whole, almost certain to occur.
Just because there is this element of luck, however, does not mean that you necessarily shouldn‚Äôt play the odds, if you so believe with very good reason that those odds are in your favor. What you do have to make sure of, however, is that you have such good reason to believe that those odds are in your favor, and that you don‚Äôt put up more than you can afford to lose, given the odds. The key takeaway and lesson to be learned, again, is to invest, both in speculations and in ‚Äòsafer‚Äô investments, based on firm knowledge of the underlying asset and intrinsic analysis, to the extent possible, and never merely based on price movements.
In the case of bitcoin, my personal belief is that there is enough to justify the possibility of long term gain based on fundamentals and first mover advantage. If everything goes right, I do see a future in which it‚Äôs possible that bitcoin achieves a market cap similar to that of gold‚Äôs, given that so far as I can see, it provides all the benefits gold does, and a host of incredibly valuable advantages on top of those existing benefits. I even see a future where it just might be possible that bitcoin goes even further, and becomes a dominant leading global currency. It‚Äôs also possible that bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain is used to power many future technological innovations, such as smart contracts and even DAOs, and thereby creates and imbues itself with even more value.
At the same time, I also see a million and one ways where bitcoin fails to reach the promised land. Bitcoin has already experienced numerous growing pains, and at the present moment, is suffering most acutely from a huge backlog of transactions that can‚Äôt be fit on the blockchain. This is because blocks are presently limited to 1 MB in size, and can consequently fit only a small fraction of all the transactions that are trying to be propagated over the network. This forces those who want to have their transactions go through to pay inordinately high transaction fees in order to prioritize their transaction over other transactions.
There are already a number of proposed solutions to this issue, such as the implementation of the Lightning Network, but in order to implement these solutions, the majority of bitcoin miners must agree to update their bitcoin software. Many bitcoin miners are reluctant to do so, in large part because high transaction fees are good for miners, at least on a short term basis, as it means they earn far more per each block mined. The implementation of the Lightning Network and other solutions threatens to take away this extra revenue stream. Hence, users of bitcoin and miners of bitcoin find themselves at odds with a very understandable conflict of interest. It‚Äôs unclear as of yet how this will be resolved, though it seems the community is pushing forward towards a resolution, and I‚Äôm of the personal belief that they‚Äôll get there eventually.
Similar problems like this are virtually guaranteed to occur in the future as well, and it‚Äôs simply impossible to predict right now how the bitcoin community might respond to and handle those problems, and if they‚Äôll be successful in doing so.
At the same time, it‚Äôs entirely unclear how governments will respond to bitcoin as it continues to grow, and if they‚Äôll attempt to crack down in a very strong way and prohibit the use of bitcoin, or the creation of bitcoin related service companies, such as exchanges. If exchanges were banned from operating, for instance, it could very well make it very difficult for most people to transact between fiat currencies and bitcoin, and render the latter far less useful than it otherwise might be.
On the flip side, if the world suffers a global financial meltdown on the scale of the Great Depression or something similar again, and fiat currencies start to crater, it very well may be such that governments are forced to resort to accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, if enough people simply flat out refuse to put their stock in fiat. This was exactly what the US government was forced to do just 13 years into their original experiment with Continental currency, when they agreed to promise to back all the currency they issued with hard gold and silver.
These are just a few of countless twists and turns and vicissitudes our much vaunted (and much derided) bitcoin will have to endure before its long journey comes to an end, either six feet under or as an indelible fixture in our global economy. There‚Äôs no telling which way it will go, and one must come to one‚Äôs own conclusion on how much faith and conviction one chooses to place in bitcoin.
That‚Äôs the case as I see it for bitcoin. In the case of most altcoins, however, I don‚Äôt see remotely enough to even begin to justify the possibility of long term gain in the first place. Even with speculations, or perhaps especially with speculations, it‚Äôs incredibly important to thoroughly analyze a given investment opportunity for at least the potential for long term gain and success, and assess the magnitude of that possible gain, and then to weigh that potential versus the likelihood of outright failure of the speculation. With most altcoins, their value over bitcoin or ethereum is far from clear, and generally superficial or minor at best.
Dogecoin is the most pure example of this. Dogecoin offers just about no fundamental innovations over bitcoin, and is in fact a self-deprecating cryptocurrency premised (initially, at least) entirely on poking fun at itself. The name itself is a reference to the doge meme, and offers little to no further justification for its existence.
Despite this fact, Dogecoin‚Äôs market cap is presently valued at over $300 million. Come to your own conclusions here.
Less immediately obvious examples include things like Litecoin. Litecoin, too, offers fundamentally no truly great innovations over bitcoin ‚Äî in short, nothing that bitcoin itself couldn‚Äôt adopt over time. It uses a different hashing algorithm and just adopted Segregated Witness, the same update that bitcoin is debating adopting that would allow the implementation of layer two protocols such as the lightning network, but beyond this, doesn‚Äôt have much in the way of unique differentiation going for it. This said, Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin and previously the Director of Engineering at Coinbase, one of the most well respected and successful bitcoin exchanges, just announced his departure from Coinbase to focus solely on improving Litecoin. It remains to be seen what will come from this endeavor, as Charlie certainly is without question one of the most accomplished and formidable players in the cryptocurrency sphere, but largely litecoin appears to be a small hedge in the slight off chance that bitcoin doesn‚Äôt actually manage to resolve its scaling issues, and begins to catastrophically lose market adoption and faith and crumble into the ground. In a case like that, the notion is that litecoin would be able to quickly take over the ground lost by bitcoin, and become the dominant cryptocurrency.
There are a number of issues with this, however, and a lot of things would have to go right before this occurred. There are several cryptocurrencies, for instance, with ethereum being the most notable, that are already far larger than litecoin, and it would have to be demonstrated that there‚Äôs some reason something like ethereum couldn‚Äôt simply take the place of bitcoin, and that litecoin would have a better shot at doing so than the larger players that already exist in this space.
Litecoin would then have to deal with exactly the same issues bitcoin has faced at scale, and it‚Äôs not clear at all that litecoin would fare any better at resolving such conflicts if ever reaches the same scale as bitcoin presently has.
All of this said, it does seem extremely likely to me that there will inevitably be some true innovation in this space, and that some cryptocurrencies will be able to carve out niches of varying degrees of value. One might even prove to ultimately demonstrate so many more advantages as to overtake bitcoin one day ‚Äî ethereum, for instance, is teetering remarkably close to doing just that, at least in terms of market cap, if not quite yet other markers such as developer activity and transaction volume. The true feat here will be discerning those few new technologies with true fundamental potential and innovative advantage (and an incredible execution strategy) behind them, from the vast swaths of similar looking yet ultimately worthless contenders almost certainly doomed to eventual failure.
Expected value is a useful concept frequently employed in poker that also serves to provide utility here. In short, expected value is a way to decide when an outcome is not certain, but a set of outcomes are probabilistically determinable, if a given action is going to be net positive or net negative, and to what degree.
The simplest example is flipping a coin. This will yield heads 50% of the time, and tails 50% of the time. Expected value of betting on the coin yielding heads, hence, is 0. This is because in any one given flip, the coin has exactly a 50% chance of coming up heads. Hence, if you bet $100 on the coin coming up heads an infinite number of times, your expected gain, or value, from such an action, is to be $0.
Conversely, if you bet at even odds that a six sided dice roll would come up 3 or higher, your expected value would be positive, as you would be correct 2/3 times. Hence, if you repeated this bet an infinite number of times, you would be guaranteed to be earning more money than you lost.
Similarly, if you were able to bet at 1:2 odds (meaning if you bet $100 and win, you get $200) that a coin would yield heads, this would also be very +EV (positive expected value). The coin would still yield heads half the time, but that half of the time, you would earn $200, and the other half of the time, you would only lose $100. Hence, repeating this bet an infinite number of times would allow you to dramatically earn more money than you lost yet again.
There are far too many variables and unknowns to take into consideration with most speculative bets, and cryptocurrency in particular, to be able to hope for anything so nice and clean as an exact mathematical probability of how + or -EV a given bet on a given cryptocurrency might turn out, just as there are far too many unknowns to calculate the precise fundamental present and future potential value of a cryptocurrency for the purpose of value investing analysis, but regardless, holding both principles at large as a general guiding strategy in determining one‚Äôs actions here and elsewhere is a good bet.
Personally, for myself, a quick back of the napkin calculation that I can do to estimate the possible future value of bitcoin is to see what the market has valued all of the gold in the world at, and use this as a rough guiding principle for seeing how much appetite the world currently has for something that can hedge against other currencies and holds similar characteristics to gold as a store of value. I can see that the total value of all the gold in the world is over 8 trillion dollars, and consequently, if bitcoin were to reach that same total valuation, each bitcoin, assuming 21 million eventual bitcoins, would be worth approximately $400,000. Dividing this by bitcoin‚Äôs current value, I can see that there‚Äôs still room for approximately 150X gains. This means that if I truly believe this is a possible outcome for bitcoin, then as long as I believe this outcome has more than a 0.66 percent chance of happening, or 1/150 chances of success, it would be an +EV bet to make.
That said, it‚Äôs extremely important to keep in mind that one doesn‚Äôt get infinite opportunities to keep playing this bet out over and over again. There is only one bitcoin in the world, and we only have one opportunity to play out this exact bet. Given this fact, it‚Äôs important to realize that if this were somehow to actually be a perfectly EV neutral bet, with a possibility of a 150X upside and a 0.66% chance of realizing that upside, it would still mean that we have a 99.33% chance of losing all our money that we place on this bet. It would be extremely foolish, therefore, to invest all our money into such a wildly speculative investment, even if it is technically EV neutral or even slightly EV positive. What might make sense, is to set aside a responsibly proportionate amount of money specifically earmarked for such wildly speculative investments as a part of a holistic investment portfolio, that one is fully willing and able to lose without significant impact to one‚Äôs well-being or quality of life, and to invest that amount of money in a +EV bet like this.
Returning to the question of calculating potential investment upside here, there are countless other ways to make projections on the future potential value of bitcoin, and I encourage you to try to make some depending on your personal beliefs regarding the level of success bitcoin might have, and the ultimate utility it might provide to the world. For instance, if you see bitcoin primarily as a way to simplify making international transactions and cut out inefficiencies there, you might look to see what the overall market size is for a solution that might solve that problem and capture that market. Western Union, as one example, is a company with a market cap of $9 billion. Consequently, it might be reasonable to expect that bitcoin‚Äôs true ultimate value would be something roughly in that order of magnitude, if this were to be bitcoin‚Äôs one true long term use case.
If you see bitcoin as most useful for its blockchain, you might calculate hence the value you think can be created through applications, contracts, and other technological innovations run on the blockchain, and use that to guide your estimation of bitcoin‚Äôs value.
If you think bitcoin will be used to primarily enable black market transactions, same deal. And so on.
I hope that this elucidation provides some insight into why I personally see it as suspect to invest in something based on price alone, and why I urge extreme caution particularly if one is exploring whether or not to invest in an altcoin, especially if one is at least partially motivated to do so because of the feeling that the ship has already sailed for bitcoin, and that there might be better potential for outsized gains with a smaller altcoin. Again, this certainly may be true, and often is true even for altcoins destined for eventual failure in the short term while a bubble/bull market continues, but risks are amplified just as much as the opportunity itself when it comes to altcoins, and oftentimes moreso in a bubble than otherwise.
It‚Äôs easy to be swept away in the fervor of a frenetic market, and the fear of missing out can be overwhelming especially when you see altcoins rising by wild amounts overnight, but my personal guiding philosophy is to always try to keep in mind fundamentals to the maximum extent possible, to never invest in anything I don‚Äôt actually understand or see long term value in, and to only invest in things I intend to hold very long term (for at least 5 years), especially in such a volatile market.
Speaking to that last point now (the ‚Äôsecond‚Äô mistake I mentioned at the beginning of this part) I‚Äôm of the personal opinion that it is incredibly important to not only invest solely in things that I truly believe have the real potential to succeed in a big way long term, but to actually commit and hold to that investment, once I make it, no matter what happens with the price short term. If some fundamental fact underlying my investment changes, I can certainly re-evaluate it, but if the price drops 90% or even 95% in the short term for no particular reason except a collapse of a local maximum in price speculation (e.g., a bubble popping), I must never be tempted to sell and try to ‚Äòtime‚Äô the market in any way. Instead, I have to hold that investment with firm conviction in what I believe the eventual price based on fundamentals is worth, regardless of how the market values it in the present moment.
This is critically important precisely for incredibly volatile speculative investments such as cryptocurrency, and plays into the fourth mistake I mentioned above, day trading, as well. More than possibly any other market I‚Äôve seen, short term price movements for cryptocurrencies are oftentimes absolutely mystifying and nothing short of mind boggling. Highly anticipated events, such as halvings in bitcoin‚Äôs reward per block mined, come and go without any real perturbation in price. Other times, things rise when reason seems to suggest they should fall, and fall when they seem to have every reason to rise. For instance, bitcoin‚Äôs price collapsed to $200 after the bubble popped in 2013, and stayed stagnant at those levels, despite massive development in bitcoin infrastructure and significant growth in the adoption and usage of bitcoin over that same period of time.
More recently, the approval or rejection of a bitcoin ETF was widely touted as being the contributing factor to a bitcoin bull run from under $1000 to over $1200. It was speculated that if the ETF were to be rejected, that naturally the price would fall to where it was before the bull run began. Indeed, the moment the ETF was announced as rejected, the price did momentarily fall to almost $1000. However, it just as quickly recovered, and began an inexorable climb all the way up to over $2700, where it stands to this day.
Consequently, with the short term price movements of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being incredibly volatile and oftentimes nothing short of inexplicable, I highly caution anyone against making decisions such as selling their bitcoins on the way down in anticipation of a market crash, so as to either avoid the crash or to buy their coins back at a cheaper price at the bottom of the crash.
This goes hand in hand with mistake number four I mentioned above: day trading. This is absolutely number one the reason I see people who have gotten into bitcoin and cryptocurrency lose their money. If you at almost any point in the history of bitcoin (earlier than say, this month of June), merely bought bitcoin and held it to the present day, you would have made money. However, countless people have actually lost money in bitcoin, and this is because they ended up trading their bitcoin somewhere along the way.
I would venture to say that most people have far more confidence in their ability to predict short term market movements than is actually the case. I‚Äôve seen plenty of instances of people who have thought that they could capitalize on short term volatility on the way up, and essentially ‚Äòbuy the dips and sell the tips‚Äô, and in every single instance I can recall, this strategy eventually fails, and often in a big way. At face value, this seems to make sense. If you think you can time when the dips will occur and when they will end, and similarly when the peaks will occur and when those will end, you can definitely make more profit along the way by selling high and buying low.
However, as I‚Äôve mentioned before, this is far more difficult, if not impossible, to do with cryptocurrency, more than even normal investment vehicles like stocks. I‚Äôve seen people who think that bitcoin has hit a peak and must necessarily stop going up sell, intending to wait until bitcoin falls again to buy in again and make maybe a 20% extra profit, miss out entirely because bitcoin kept going up and never came back down. There are numerous stories of those who bought into bitcoin at $1 or less, but sold well before it ever reached even $10, much less $2500.
With something as speculative as cryptocurrency in the first place, it makes no sense to invest in this space to begin with if your only goal is to make 20% profit. It almost certainly isn‚Äôt worth the risk at that level of gain. Hence, risking losing out on the long term upside of 10X+ that you‚Äôve calculated and come to the conclusion does exist for a gain of less than 1X or .5X in most cases makes little to no sense at all. It only makes sense if it‚Äôs essentially a guaranteed gain with no risk, and that, again, is almost certainly not the case.
Indeed, some market movements are fundamentally unpredictable in their short term timing. Two very vivid examples of this were the collapse of Mt Gox for bitcoin, and the hacking of the DAO for ethereum. Both of these events absolutely cratered the price of bitcoin and ethereum respectively, and both of them were fundamentally unpredictable in their exact timing. These are examples of the black swan events I mentioned that are certain to continue playing a large role in short term price developments for bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies at large, that make it doubly dangerous for those who day trade.
I‚Äôve also seen plenty of people who intend to hold long term, but lose faith when they see their investment crater 30%, 50%, or even 70%. At this point, they lose faith, and decide to sell their investment to at least recoup some of their initial capital, and not lose everything outright. Thus, they end up buying high and selling low, and then having double regret when bitcoin eventually ended up rebounding even higher than the ‚Äòhigh‚Äô they bought at.
This illustrates even more vividly why it‚Äôs incredibly dangerous to invest in anything you don‚Äôt actually believe in, and aren‚Äôt willing to hold, long term. If you aren‚Äôt going to hold something long term, then generally you must believe that while the price will rise in the short term, it will not continue to rise in the long term. If you hold this belief, it generally means that there‚Äôs some reason that you believe what you are investing in won‚Äôt hold true value long term, but that there is enough speculative mania in the short term to make the price go up anyway. The thinking goes that if this is going to be true, you might as well profit from this speculative mania and buy in now, wait for a little bit for the price to rise, and then sell it for short term profit.
The problem with this is that just about everyone else investing in these things is thinking the same thing, and everyone involved is effectively playing the greater fool theory, expecting that they will be smarter than everyone else and be able to time the market better than everyone else, and get out before everyone else does, and before the price eventually collapses. By mere inviolable fact, most people who engage in this form of speculation are guaranteed to lose in a big way. Over enough iterations, the eventual likelihood of loss generally grows to become one, in my opinion, as one must continue to time a market correctly time and time again for this to work. While it may seem like the market will continue being bullish for you to get in and get out before things go south, this is true of every moment in time right up until things go south all at once. Inevitably, at some point, the gravy train will have to derail and explode in a rolling ball of fire.
I know for a fact that I‚Äôm certainly not remotely smart or knowledgeable enough to pull off this kind of short term investment that aims to profit from market sentiment alone, especially not in the turbulent, mercurial waters of cryptocurrency, and that‚Äôs all I can say about this here. On top of this, the existence of black swan events that can crater an entire market unpredictably short term introduces a variable that inherently is just about impossible to predict, and makes short term bets like this even more dangerous.
The most dangerous game of all, then, in my opinion, is day trading in altcoins that one doesn‚Äôt believe in long term. This is basically combining every ‚Äòmistake‚Äô I mention above: trading in something because of short term price movements, not holding it long term, day trading, and speculating in highly risky small cap altcoins. If you manage to survive doing this over any long period of time (5 years+, let‚Äôs say) and end up net profitable (particularly if you end up more profitable than just buying and holding over that same period of time), please do let me know, as I‚Äôd be extremely curious to hear just how you pulled it off.
Going back to my personal story, ultimately the crash from $1200 to $200 for bitcoin was the best thing that could have ever possibly happened to me. At the time, of course, it certainly didn‚Äôt feel that way. It felt like I had made an absolutely stupid, foolish decision, and had lost all my money. In fact, I did make a stupid, foolish decision, but not for the reason I thought at the time. I didn‚Äôt make a stupid, foolish decision because the price had cratered to $200. I made a stupid, foolish decision in deciding to invest in bitcoin and altcoins without actually having done my research and without really knowing anything about them.
Had I actually done my research and believed that it was a fair bet to make that one day bitcoins would be worth far more than even the height of the local maximum bubble at the time, it absolutely could have been the right decision to buy in then, even if it crashed later temporarily to $200. What wasn‚Äôt right was buying in simply because the price was going up and I had a fear of missing out.
The crash proved to be the best thing that could have happened, however, because it gave me time to actually do my research and learn about bitcoin, and have real reasons for believing in it long term, at a point in time where the price was unusually deflated. As a consequence, I was able to buy more bitcoin at the very bottom of the market, around $230 or so, when I became truly convinced of bitcoin‚Äôs long term potential. I was also lucky enough to decide not to sell the bitcoins I had originally purchased for $1000 or so, and ultimately saw even those return 250%+ in profit.
It was at this time, incidentally, that Coinbase, became worried about stagnant growth of their user base, and decided to offer a truly astounding proposition. They offered to pay anyone who referred a new customer to Coinbase $75 if the new customer purchased just $100 in bitcoin. Coinbase took a 1% transaction fee at the time, meaning that for every $100 in bitcoin a person purchased, Coinbase charged $1. In short, Coinbase would pay out $75 for every $1 a new customer paid them.
It didn‚Äôt take a genius to see a clear arbitrage opportunity here, and I wrote up a quick blog post detailing this opportunity and fired out a single Facebook post telling my friends about it. From that post and just a few hours of work, I ended up earning almost 17 bitcoins entirely for free ‚Äî worth over $45,000 today. I had plans to scale this strategy en masse, but singlehandedly ended up killing the program almost as soon as it started, when Coinbase finally came to its senses and realized just how much money it was hemorrhaging here with no hope for eventual recoupment (at the time, the lifetime value of the average customer was only something like $25 to Coinbase ‚Äî a far cry from the $75 they were offering).
Digression aside, that sums up most of the thoughts I have about the primary things to be cautious about when it comes to bitcoin investment. There are a few more practical matters to be extremely cautious about (namely, how you store your cryptocurrency), but I‚Äôll address those in the next part, which will be an actual how-to guide showing actually actionable steps for those interested in getting into bitcoin investment.
The final point to make, then, are a few thoughts on how to correctly invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. I have no truly great pieces of wisdom to offer here, but do have a few ideas that primarily aid in being psychologically being resilient to the short term vicissitudes of cryptocurrency investment.
Once you‚Äôve decided that you truly believe in a cryptocurrency long term, and are willing to commit to it for the long term and hold it no matter what the short term price movements might be, the next step is to decide how much to invest, and when to invest. One might be hesitant, with not bad reason, to invest at an all time high, even if one believes that that all time high will one day be exceeded.
The mere fact that the future potential is still huge doesn‚Äôt necessarily preclude the fact that cryptocurrency may be in a short term bubble, and that prices might crater any day by 30%, 50%, 80%, or even more.
Generally, the strategy suggested to average out such short term volatility for something that one is investing in long term is to practice dollar cost averaging. This preaches that one should set an exact time at regular time intervals to buy an exact amount in fiat currency of the investment one is looking to purchase ‚Äî e.g., $1,000 worth of bitcoin on the 1st of every week, or every month. This means that over time, you‚Äôll be able to take advantage of bitcoin‚Äôs general trajectory upwards, but balance out the relative short term volatile price movements both high and low, such that you experience a more linear growth trajectory over time of your principal.
I think that this is a great strategy, and personally practice it with a few modifications. While I‚Äôll never sell at any price essentially (unlike other investments, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are unique in that they are currencies, and consequently if they succeed, you won‚Äôt have to sell them to gain value from them. You can just use them directly, just as you might US dollars or any other form of currency. In the manner that I use the word sell here however, I mean that I likely won‚Äôt sell at any price under $100,000, as that‚Äôs where I personally see the moonshot value of bitcoin going towards, in the slight chance that it does succeed), no matter how high the price rises in the short term, if and when the price becomes particularly low as a result of a cratering market, I will look to buy more than I normally would, to double down on my investment here ‚Äî all the while keeping in mind never to invest more than I‚Äôm perfectly willing to lose entirely.
Psychologically, if it‚Äôs helpful, I think it may be fine to sell off some small portion of your upside if you do realize upside over time, in order to recoup your initially invested principal. I don‚Äôt think that this is necessarily the most optimal actual move to make, but do think it likely makes a huge difference psychologically, such that it makes it far easier for you to hold your remaining investment with sangfroid in the case that it ends up cratering sometime in the future.
As for investing an initial lump sum to begin getting exposure in this space, my personal strategy would be to do a semi-timed dollar cost average, if one is particularly concerned that they might be investing just before a local minimum market crash, but also particularly concerned that the price may keep rapidly appreciating ad infinitum, and would like to get in before that happens. That is, I‚Äôd decide the total lump sum I‚Äôd be willing to set aside to invest here, say, $10,000, and invest 33% or 50% of it immediately. Then, if the market did crash, I‚Äôd be psychologically very happy, and be super excited to invest another 33% or 50%. On the flip side, if the market continued to rise indefinitely and never fell again, I‚Äôd also be happy that at least I was able to get exposure to the market and didn‚Äôt miss out entirely. A 33‚Äì33‚Äì33 split would allow me to invest 3 times when I felt the market was at a particularly good time for investment, and a 50‚Äì50 split twice. Just random arbitrary examples of divisions I might do here, depending on how exactly wary I feel about the market at the present moment in time.
That about sums up my thoughts on cryptocurrency investment at large. There are some nuances, but I figure 8000+ words worth of a brain dump is a good enough place to start. If you‚Äôre still here, please feel free to read on to Part III if your constitution allows for further word consumption.
The shortest section by far. If you made it this far, you deserve to just be able to buy your crypto and be done with it all. I‚Äôll try to make that as easy as possible. There are still quite a few bases to cover, however.
Note: The following bit about exchanges to use holds true for those in the United States. For those based elsewhere, you‚Äôll need to do your own research on the best exchanges to use in your country. The rest of this post should hold the same for everyone in the world, however.
The easiest way to invest is to sign up at Coinbase.com. If you sign up with a referral code, you get $10 when you purchase $100 in bitcoin or ether. I‚Äôve linked my mom‚Äôs referral code here if anyone is interested. Straight to her retirement fund! (In the interest of having zero monetary gain from my fiduciary advice, however, just email me if you use this link and buy over $100 of bitcoin, and I‚Äôll send you the whole $10 my mom receives on her end as a referrer ‚Äî so you get $20 for investing $100. Not bad! ‚ÜíSORRY NEVER MIND I‚ÄôVE BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH THESE MESSAGES AND CAN‚ÄôT KEEP MANUALLY DOING THIS, but you‚Äôre still welcome to use the code and get a free $10 and give my mom a free $10 too!)
However, this is not the cheapest way to invest. That‚Äôs GDAX.com (no referral bonus with this, though). Thankfully, GDAX.com is the same company as Coinbase, and utilizes the same login. Once you make your Coinbase account, you can just login with it to GDAX.com.
At GDAX.com, which is Coinbase‚Äôs exchange, you‚Äôre able to get trades in for either 0% as a market maker (meaning you limit buy or sell and set your own price and ‚Äòmake‚Äô the market), or 0.25% as a market taker (meaning you just buy or sell at whatever price the market is currently at with a market buy).
You can trade immediately as much as you want by sending a wire (only applicable for US customers) to your account following their deposit instructions. There‚Äôs a $10 fee for this that GDAX charges, on top of whatever your bank charges to send wire transactions. This is the fastest method to deposit any amount of money you want and trade immediately with no limits, but not the cheapest.
You can alternatively conduct ACH withdrawals from your bank as well by going to the Coinbase accounts page, clicking on your ‚ÄúUSD Wallet‚Äù, and clicking the Deposit button in the top right hand corner. These are completely free, but take anywhere from four business days to a week to complete.
You can even use a credit card to buy straight from Coinbase.com, but fees here are very hefty. Use as a last resort.
Keep in mind that while you can put however much money you want into GDAX at any point in time, you are generally limited to withdrawing $10,000 per 24 hour period. Thus, if you are buying a large amount of say, Ethereum to send to a token sale address, keep in mind that if you want to send over $10,000, you‚Äôll need to purchase that amount and withdraw it well in advance of the token sale.
For instance, if you wanted to send $100,000 of ethereum somewhere, you‚Äôd need to buy all that ethereum and withdraw over the course of 10 days (assuming you withdrew perfectly each day every 24 hours ‚Äî realistically more like 11‚Äì14 days) back to Coinbase or your personal ethereum wallet before you could then send that ethereum on to somewhere else all at one time, like you would need to do in a token sale.
On GDAX, you can buy bitcoin, ethereum, or litecoin.
From there, if you‚Äôd like to buy any alternative currencies, you can use your bitcoin or ethereum on Shapeshift.io without any account to instantly transfer your bitcoin or ethereum to any other cryptocurrency under the sun, essentially.
To buy/sell on Coinbase or GDAX, you need no wallet, as Coinbase/GDAX will keep your coins for you. You‚Äôll want to enable Google Authenticator for two factor authentication and keep your passwords and your phone incredibly secure, however, as if someone hacks your account, all your money is gone for good with no recourse. This happens a lot. Use a super strong password that you have not used elsewhere and that no one knows and that you won‚Äôt forget.
Ideally, you‚Äôll keep the coins yourself on your own hardware device, which is ultra secure. I recommend Trezor.io (as of this writing, they‚Äôve just run out of stock, but are only backordered a few days if you‚Äôre willing to pay a premium) for this purpose. Ledger Nano S is also good and cheaper to boot, but I personally haven‚Äôt used it and it‚Äôs very backordered in sales. I can recommend Trezor 100% wholeheartedly, however.
Trezor will keep your coins safe because the device itself is immune to hacking by design, and never exposes your private keys (the passwords to your accounts, essentially), even if your computer is infected by malware and is logging all your typing/passwords, or is specifically scanning for private keys, or is engaging in any other form of sneaky bad behavior.
It does this by signing all transactions on the device itself using your private key, and only transmitting the signature to your computer, and never your private key. As a general rule, this is very good, because a good rule of thumb is to never expose your private keys to the internet, under the assumption that the internet is inherently insecure, and if you ever have your private keys interact in any direct way with a computer that has been connected to the internet, you should consider the addresses those private keys correspond to to be compromised and vulnerable to being hacked.
A Trezor also allows you to set multiple passwords that open secret vaults to different wallets on your device, such that even if in some crazy scenario someone just kidnaps you and threatens to beat you with a wrench until you give them your coins (not too crazy actually ‚Äî I‚Äôve been abducted before and had to ransom myself for thousands of dollars in Africa), you can just give them a second password to another wallet that holds say $500 in cryptocurrency instead of $10 million, and there‚Äôs no way for them to know that that‚Äôs not all the money you had on your Trezor.
If someone steals your Trezor, they won‚Äôt be able to find your coins either, as they‚Äôre protected by a PIN that only you know (plus a password if you want to use that feature I mentioned above). You can also recover the coins yourself with the recovery seed the Trezor will give you the first time you use it, which you should store in a super safe location like a safe deposit box somewhere. If you don‚Äôt use utilize the password feature, however, keep in mind that anyone who discovers this recovery seed instantly has access to all your coins, and all your other forms of security are for naught. If you enable the password feature, however, they will need your password as well as the recovery seed in able to access your cryptocurrency, which makes it significantly more secure.
A Trezor will give you your own personal wallets for bitcoin, ethereum, dash, zcash, and litecoin, as well as any ERC20 token built on top of ethereum.
Another benefit of holding coins yourself, in a hardware wallet or elsewhere, is that you know that you 100% own all of your money. Exchanges are just like banks, in the sense that you trust them to hold your money for you. If they end up losing that money to hackers or stealing it themselves, you‚Äôre out of luck. This isn‚Äôt just a scary bedtime story ‚Äî countless cryptocurrency exchanges have been embezzled or hacked (an enormous percentage, actually), and hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost.
Moreover, in the event of a hard fork, whereby two blockchains are created, and consequently, two sets of coins that you technically should own, only some exchanges will actually give you access to both sets of coins. Most notably, Coinbase has explicitly stated that they will only give you access to the dominant blockchain that emerges from a hard fork, no matter how much value the market assigns the non-dominant chain. They may or may not give you access to the other coins in the future, but there is no guarantee either way. In any event, with any exchange you are fundamentally agreeing to trust them to give you access to both sets of your coins, even if they say they will. If you own your coins yourself in your own wallet, however, you need to trust no one. You will automatically own both sets of coins by default in the event of any fork.
This, too, is not merely a theoretical matter. Ethereum did indeed hard fork after the DAO hack, and split off into ETH (the current dominant blockchain for ethereum) and ETC (the ‚Äòclassic‚Äô, or original blockchain for ethereum). As of this time, ETC is worth over $20 a coin ‚Äî more, in fact, than all of ethereum was worth before the hack. Had I kept my ethereum on Coinbase or another exchange like it at the time of the hard fork, I personally would have lost 5 figures in ETC (at present values) merely because the exchanges wouldn‚Äôt give me access to these coins that I rightfully owned.
Finally, my personal preference is to avoid keeping all my eggs in one basket. Despite the fact that a hardware wallet like Trezor is technically one of the most secure options for keeping your coins safe with a fair amount of redundancy in recovery options, the fact remains that one day I might somehow lose access to my coins held within Trezor. I might suffer a concussion, for instance, that causes me to forget the password or the PIN required to access the Trezor, or perhaps I lose my Trezor and am unable to locate or decipher my recovery seed.
Because of this, I actually personally keep my cryptocurrency distributed in several reasonably safe baskets. For instance, despite Coinbase being an exchange that fundamentally requires some trust, they are more trustworthy than almost any other exchange on a technical level (their customer service, however, leaves something to be desired), and it is virtually impossible for their coins to be hacked to any significant degree, and all those at risk of being hacked are fully insured. As a consequence, I leave some of my coins with them, merely because in many ways, I trust their technical security measures more than I trust my own. Before GBTC started trading at such an absurd premium, I also kept some of my funds with them, both in part to diversify across multiple platforms to reduce the risk of losing all my coins with one bad black swan event, and also because it was the only immediately easy way to put some of my retirement funds into bitcoin, short of creating a self directed IRA.
Okay ‚Äî so that‚Äôs about it for investing in the dominant cryptocurrencies available today. If you want to invest in other more speculative altcoins, you‚Äôll have to create your own wallets for them, and investigate the best and most secure solution for doing so yourself. This should generally be a good exercise in any case to determine if you meet the bare minimum requirements for responsible investment in a given altcoin.
Congratulations, you‚Äôve made it to the end. That‚Äôs it. Good luck!

Get notified when the book comes out here.
Around 2003 I came across Charlie Munger‚Äôs 1995 speech, The Psychology of Human Misjudgment, which introduced me to how behavioral economics can be applied in business and investing. More profoundly, though, it opened my mind to the power of seeking out and applying mental models across a wide array of disciplines.
A mental model is just a concept you can use to help try to explain things (e.g. Hanlon‚Äôs Razor ‚Äî ‚Äúnever attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness.‚Äù). There are tens of thousands of mental models, and every discipline has their own set that you can learn through coursework, mentorship, or first-hand experience.
There is a much smaller set of concepts, however, that come up repeatedly in day-to-day decision making, problem solving, and truth seeking. As Munger says, ‚Äú80 or 90 important models will carry about 90% of the freight in making you a worldly‚Äêwise person.‚Äù
This post is my attempt to enumerate the mental models that are repeatedly useful to me. This set is clearly biased from my own experience and surely incomplete. I hope to continue to revise it as I remember and learn more.
How-to Use This List
I find mental models are useful to try to make sense of things and to help generate ideas. To actually be useful, however, you have to apply them in the right context at the right time. And for that to happen naturally, you have to know them well and practice using them.
Therefore, here are two suggestions for using this list:

Do These 15 Things Immediately.|"Most people wish their circumstances would magically change for them. They don‚Äôt have the desire to become better themselves so they can proactively improve their own circumstances.
Unlike most people, who simply wait and wish for luck, you can seek to become the kind of person equipped with the skills and abilities to do brilliant things.
You can become the kind of person who does highly influential work. Your work can solve pressing problems, improve people‚Äôs lives, and get noticed by important people who share your work not for your sake, but for theirs! Sharing your work makes them look good because of how great it is.
The quality of who you are as a person, and the work you do, is completely within your control. But you can‚Äôt wish for it to happen. You must become the kind of person who naturally attracts the success you seek.
Here‚Äôs how:
If you don‚Äôt pay for something, you rarely pay attention.
Most people want stuff that‚Äôs free. But if you get something for free, you rarely prize that thing. You rarely take it seriously.
How much do you invest in yourself?
How committed are you to yourself?
If you aren‚Äôt investing in yourself, than you don‚Äôt have any skin in the game of your own life.
If you aren‚Äôt invested in your business, you probably won‚Äôt do high quality work.
If you‚Äôre not invested in your relationships, you‚Äôre probably more focused on what you can get than what you can give.
When it comes to self-improvement, investing 10% of your income on yourself will yield a 100X or more return on that investment. For every dollar you spend on your education, skills, and relationships, you‚Äôll get at least 100 dollars back in returns.
If you want to do something extremely well, you need to surround yourself with the right mentors. Anything that you‚Äôll ever do well will be the result of high quality mentoring. If you suck at something, it‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt received quality mentoring in that thing.
The best mentorships are the ones where you pay your mentor. Often, the more you pay the better, because you‚Äôll take the relationship far more seriously. You won‚Äôt solely be taking in that relationship. You won‚Äôt purely be a consumer. Instead, you‚Äôll be invested, and as such, you‚Äôll listen more carefully. You‚Äôll care more. You‚Äôll be more thoughtful and engaged. There will be higher consequences for not succeeding.
I invested $3,000 to get help writing my first book proposal from a highly successful writer. That $3,000 got me maybe 4 or 5 hours of his time. But in those 4 or 5 hours, he taught me what I needed to know to create an amazing book proposal. He provided me resources that dramatically enhanced and sped up my process. With his help, I was able to get a literary agent and eventually a multi six figure book contract.
Had I been overly concerned about the $3,000, I‚Äôm confident that to this day, I‚Äôd still not have written a book proposal. At the very most, I‚Äôd have written a terrible one. I would not have been as motivated or invested, so I would have been far more likely to procrastinate needed action.
If you don‚Äôt have much money, surely you can afford to buy a book. How much money and time do you spend on entertainment, clothes, or food? It‚Äôs a matter of priority.
It‚Äôs only when you invest in something that you have the motivation to make it happen.
Beyond mentorships, you should invest in education programs such as online courses, books, quality products such as food and sleep.
Your level of success can generally be directly measured by your level of investment. If you‚Äôre not getting the results you want, it‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt invested enough to get those results.
Your number 1 investment must be yourself.
Who you are determines:
Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find when you financially invest yourself in something. You become very committed to that thing. Economists call this sunk cost bias. But you can leverage this to your benefit. If you want to escalate your personal commitment to something, invest heavily in that thing.
Eventually, it will become a point of no return.
You‚Äôll become so fiercely committed that withdrawing will seem ridiculous.
Hence, you‚Äôll need to truly know WHAT you want and WHY (see #14 below). If you don‚Äôt know these things, then over-committing could be a huge and irrational problem.
However, if you are certain about WHO you are/want to be, WHAT you want, and WHY, then you need to invest yourself.
Most people are consumers rather than creators.
They are at work to get their paycheck, not to make a difference.
When left to their own devices, most people consume their time as well. It is only by investing your time that you get a return on that time.
Nearly every second spent on social media is consumed time. You can‚Äôt have that time back. Rather than making your future better, it actually made your future worse. Just like eating bad food, every consumed moment leaves you worse off. Every invested moment leaves you better off.
Entertainment is all well and good. But only when that entertainment is an investment in your relationships or yourself. You‚Äôll know if it was an investment if that entertainment continues to yield returns over and over in your future. That may include positive memories, transformational learning, or deepened relationships.
Even still, life isn‚Äôt purely about being entertained. Education and learning is also key. And although both are essential, education will provide far greater returns in your future.
The world‚Äôs most successful people are intense learners. They are hard readers. They know that what they know determines how well they see the world. They know that what they know determines the quality of relationships they can have and the quality of work they can do.
If you are constantly consuming junk media, how can you possibly expect to create high value work? Your input directly translates to your output. Garbage in, garbage out.
Just as a large majority of your down-time should be spent learning, so should a great deal of your ‚Äúworking‚Äù time.
Wealthy and happy people work to learn. Unsuccessful and unhappy people work primarily for money.
Only 20% of your energy should be spent doing your actual work. The rest should be spent learning, improving yourself, and resting.
It is by ‚Äúsharpening your saw‚Äù that you‚Äôll continue to become a better and more capable person. Thus, as you dedicate large portions of time becoming a better thinker, communicator, and better at your craft, the quality of your work will continue to increase. Eventually, you‚Äôll be able to charge VERY VERY high fees for your work, because no one else can do it like you.
When you prioritize learning and recovery, then during the hours you are actually working, you‚Äôll be in a deep flow state. You won‚Äôt be distracted like most people are when they work. You‚Äôre either 100% on or 100% off. While working, you can get more done in a few hours than most people get done in a number of days.
Your time is spent well because your priorities are clear, you‚Äôre well-rested, and your mind is stimulated.
In our media and information age, there are a million things you could learn. But if you don‚Äôt put that learning into immediate practice, it becomes shallow information.
Information and knowledge are two very different things.
Knowledge and wisdom are also two very different things.
It takes wisdom to determine what you should learn, why you should learn it, and when you should learn it.
Unless you‚Äôre invested, you probably won‚Äôt learn with the intensity needed to maximize that knowledge.
Unless you understand the value of your time, you probably won‚Äôt have the discernment to ignore almost everything while learning that which will bring the highest return.
When you learn something, you should get a return on that learning. Far too many people read books now just to say they‚Äôve read lots of books. If you‚Äôre not applying what you‚Äôre learning, your consuming and wasting your time.
Very few people create true wealth.
Even those who have high incomes are not truly wealthy. Most people‚Äôs lifestyles match their incomes. When they make more, they consume more. In fact, most people make money solely to consume.
Very few people make money to invest that money.
It‚Äôs best to think of your business as only 1/2 of your income equation. You have your business which brings income. Then, you have your investment entity to turn your income into even more money.
Like anything, how well you manage your money is determined by how well mentored you are. If you want to become brilliant with money, invest in education and mentoring.
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The best time to start investing was also in the past. If you haven‚Äôt started yet, don‚Äôt sit and wallow in regret. Tomorrow doesn‚Äôt exist for people who don‚Äôt do something today.
Start today. Get yourself educated. Create a vehicle, or several vehicles, where you put at least 10% of your income. Eventually, your investment vehicle may even start producing more profits for you than your actual business.
Compound interest is a real thing. If you put 10% of your income into your investments over a long enough period of time, you‚Äôll be set. Unlike the majority of high earners out there, you‚Äôll be able to STOP WORKING whenever you want, because your money is making more than enough money for you to comfortably live with.
Most people are only focused on what they can get out of life.
Me, me, me.
However, once you become more consciously awake to the world, your desire will shift from merely receiving to giving.
You‚Äôll realize that it‚Äôs actually far more satisfying to give than to get.Moreover, you‚Äôll be driven by a cause you fully believe in.
The truth is, you really only have 1 of 2 orientations towards people (and life).
Either you are in relationships as TRANSACTIONS, or as TRANSFORMATIONS.
Most people have transactional relationships. They‚Äôre focused only on what they get out of the relationship. It‚Äôs all about furthering their own agenda. It‚Äôs rooted in scarcity. It‚Äôs selfish.
This isn‚Äôt how you get far in relationships and life.
It‚Äôs also how you get stuck in your own small-mindedness.
Transformational relationships, on the other hand, are completely focused on giving and gratitude ‚Äî the hallmarks of abundance. In these relationships, the whole becomes more than the sum of parts. Both parties, in vulnerability and trust, transcend their own small-mindedness and become something more.
At the core, this requires being a giver, not a taker. As Adam Grant has explained in his book, Give and Take, when two givers come together, the results are astronomical.
Here‚Äôs a pro-tip: don‚Äôt surround yourself with takers.
When your motivation is to give, you‚Äôll often get insights about how you can improve your relationships. Random thoughts will pop into you head to send ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù texts to various people.
You‚Äôll have more ideas about how you can improve other people‚Äôs lives and businesses.
You‚Äôll start contributing more, which will lead to far more opportunities and deeper relationships. People will come to love and trust you. Your work will be motivated by a higher cause and thus will be far more inspired and impactful.
Just because your primary motivation is to give, doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt also seek a lot of help.
Actually, you are constantly seeking and receiving help.
The truth is, everyone is highly dependent on other people to do what they do. But it takes wisdom and humility to openly acknowledge that dependence. Rather than seeing it as a weakness, realize that it‚Äôs a strength.
Beyond acknowledging your dependence, constantly express your appreciation to the people in your life. That which you appreciate, appreciates. Relationships are assets that can and should grow bigger and better over time. As the brilliant entrepreneur Michael Fishman has said, ‚ÄúSelf-made is an illusion. There are many people who played divine roles in you having the life that you have today. Be sure to let them know how grateful you are.‚Äù
If you don‚Äôt appreciate and give to your relationships, your relationships will suffer. All relationships are like bank accounts, and if one person is constantly depositing and the other person is constantly withdrawing, eventually all of the resources become depleted.
In such relationships, 1+1=less than 2.
Conversely, in synergistic and healthy relationships, 1+1= far more than 2. When two people are continually giving and receiving, the relational bank account continues to grow and expand, providing several intended and unintended benefits.
For example, I was recently at the gym with my brother. At the beginning of the workout, he was struggling mentally. He wasn‚Äôt adding to my energy and helping my workout become better than if I was alone, but instead, he was sucking my energy and requiring me to exert more energy and effort than if I was alone.
I made him aware of what was happening, and he immediately shifted his emotional posture. He realized how dramatically his mood was impacting me. His motivation shifted from consuming an experience to creating something great.
Our shared mental state heightened, taking us into group flow. Our workout become far superior to anything I could create on my own. Not only that, but we began to engage in inspired conversation. This led to brilliant insights and connections that were relevant to the book I‚Äôm writing.
The amazing workout was the intended outcome of our synergy. The insights for my book were unintended benefits. This can only happen when both parties are actively giving and receiving from the relationship. Where both are focusing on creating rather than consuming. Where both have the primary motivation of helping the other person succeed.
Most people are in a state of competition rather than collaboration.
Collaboration is a much higher level than competition.
Competition is focused on the self. It‚Äôs also very low level thinking, because what you can do on your own is very limited.
People who are competing are grinding. They‚Äôre more focused on winning than creating real solutions.
However, when your thinking becomes expanded, you realize you could do so much more with other people. Collaboration creates unique connections working by yourself never could.
You have skills and knowledge that are awesome in your field. There are other people in different fields who have skills and knowledge completely outside of your current awareness. These people also have assets you don‚Äôt have.
If you want to get 10X or 100X the results of other people in your field, you need to develop strategic ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù partnerships. This generally happens when you devise a plan where your skill sets and assets merge with the skill sets and assets of someone else.
What you can do well, someone else may struggle with. What you struggle with, others can do extremely well.
Who can you partner with that could speed your process?
Who has assets and resources you don‚Äôt?
How could you help these people?
What types of partnerships could you develop, that would allow you to more quickly achieve your goals and help them more quickly achieve theirs?
When you collaborate with other people, 1+1=more than 2. The whole becomes DIFFERENT from the sum of it‚Äôs parts.
This is how TRANSFORMATION occurs. Only those who engage in collaboration actually experience true transformation. People who only work well by themselves are stuck in their own narrow worldview and agendas.
When you merge with others, your ideas and goals change. They become bigger and better. They become DIFFERENT from what you could ever create on your own.
The only way to have these types of partnerships is to think long-term. You must be invested and have skin in the game. It can‚Äôt be transactional. It‚Äôs can‚Äôt be this for that. It must be about something a lot deeper. When it is, you‚Äôll have far more integrity in the work you do. You‚Äôll express greater appreciation. You‚Äôll consistently do the right thing, even if that right thing is difficult and uncomfortable.
Don‚Äôt seek transactional relationships. Only seek long-term TRANSFORMATIONAL relationships.
Look at your current goals.
Why is that your metric for ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù?
Why is that your target?
What would happen if, in all seriousness, you 10X‚Äôd that target?
What if rather than earning $3,000/month, you pursued $30,000/month?
Is that even possible?
Of course it‚Äôs possible. There‚Äôs several people doing it.
The only difference between them and you is their education, relationships, and strategy.
When you set a 10X goal, you‚Äôre required to think very differently about your daily behaviors. You‚Äôre required to be more serious in all aspects of your life. You‚Äôre required to eliminate limiting thinking and consumptive distractions.
Setting a 10X goal will be one of the best things you‚Äôve ever done for yourself. This goal should be created while you are in a peak state. You get into a peak state by doing something powerful, whether that be exercising, learning, or being in a unique environment, such as a foreign country. You can even get into a peak state by being around certain types of people, the ones who inspire you to be the best version of yourself.
Only you know what gets you into a peak and passionate state. So, do whatever it is that gets you there, and then write down your goals. Declare what you‚Äôre going to do. Then write that goal down and visualize it‚Äôs achievement every single day until it becomes your reality.
When you think about this goal, don‚Äôt deviate from the natural flow of ideas that follow.
You can‚Äôt 10X your results by engaging in the same thinking and behaviors you‚Äôre currently performing. Consequently, while thinking about your goal, you‚Äôll also get ideas about what you need to do, realistically, to achieve that goal.
Chances are, you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know. So you‚Äôll need to start really educating yourself about how you could conceivably achieve your goal.You‚Äôll need to get bolder about the work you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôll need to create more, and fail more. Over and over, in fact. Quantity is often the fastest path to quality.
Not only that, but when you think about your 10X goal, you‚Äôll probably have ideas that scare you. When you do work that scares you, you cross a boundary that most people never cross. Scary work is often highly profitable and valuable work.
Marketing is nothing more than applied psychology.
It‚Äôs about connecting with people, persuading them, and helping them.
Many people think marketing is a nasty or immoral thing.
Many ‚Äúartists‚Äù don‚Äôt learn marketing because they don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúsell out.‚Äù They want their work to be pure.
Academics are not better. Their work is not accessible to the common man.
Marketing is nothing more than making your work easier and better to find and use.
People aren‚Äôt magically going to appear and buy your stuff.
People aren‚Äôt going to magically appear and read your stuff.
Even right now: How did you land on this page? Look at the title of this article. I could have just as easily called it, ‚ÄúAdvice for becoming successful.‚Äù
But would you have clicked on that article?
Probably not.
But you clicked on this one.
Why did you click on this one?
How did you get this far down?
Think about the experience.
Marketing is the ‚ÄúHOW‚Äù to whatever it is you do.
The reason most people aren‚Äôt successful is because they either fear or avoid marketing. For the same reason, most people are bad teachers. They‚Äôre more focused on content than the delivery and design of that content.
But the delivery ‚Äî the HOW ‚Äî is just as important IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT than WHAT you‚Äôre doing or WHY you‚Äôre doing it.
You could have the cure for cancer. But if you don‚Äôt market it well, you‚Äôll never get your cure out there.
You could have the world‚Äôs most important message, or greatest story, but no one will see it if you don‚Äôt promote and package it intelligently.
Founder of the exclusive entrepreneurial coaching platform, Strategic Coach, Dan Sullivan distinguishes between those who are in the ‚ÄúTime-and-Effort Economy‚Äù with those who are in the ‚ÄúResults Economy.‚Äù
If you‚Äôre in the time and effort economy, you are focused on being busy. You actually believe the amount of time and energy you put into something merits praise. Conversely, when you are in the results economy, you are only focused on achieving a specific result.
The bottom line is what matters, and thus, it becomes very important to find the most effective way to get there. This is a key difference between entrepreneurs and employees. As Sullivan says:
Most people don‚Äôt think in terms of results because their security is in a paycheck. However, when you shift your focus from how little you can do to how much you can do, you change how you work.
You start learning ways to accomplish more faster. You take on greater responsibility. You change your environment. And you also realize just how important sleep and rest are to achieving the highest possible results. Hence, you begin to take more and more time off and rest.
When you dedicate 80 percent of your energy to rest and self-improvement, then you have a lot of fodder and a very sharp saw to use during the time you‚Äôre actually working.
You‚Äôre thinking 10X bigger than everyone else. You‚Äôre operating under short timelines and high pressure. You can tax yourself to extremes while you work because you spend lots and lots of time resting and preparing.
The environments you work in should reflect the work you‚Äôre doing.
Doing several types of work in the same environment is ineffective. But people do it all the time. They sit in the same seat and mentally shift from one task to another.
A far better approach is to BATCH your activities and to do those activities in a relevant environment.
For example, when I write a blog post, I work in a quiet library where I have no distractions. Because my environment facilitates quality writing, and because I knew I‚Äôd be writing that day, I write a lot. It‚Äôs easier to write 2‚Äì5 blog posts in one sitting than to try writing one post at a time.
Ari Meisel, author and entrepreneur, batches his activities and alternates his environments to match the work he‚Äôs doing. On days he is recording podcasts, he goes to a studio and records about 5 podcast episodes in a single session.
On other days, he spends his whole day in meetings or on calls. He does this work at his friend‚Äôs apartment because it‚Äôs a much more engaging environment.
He also does a lot of writing, and does that at the SOHO HOUSE in New York City, because it‚Äôs a quiet environment with poor internet connection. The lack of connection stops him from surfing the web and even using his phone, because he has bad reception.
Success and wealth are not all about money.
There are a lot of people who have money and have little ‚Äúcapital‚Äù in the other key areas of their lives.
Money, obviously, is very important. It solves a lot of problems. It‚Äôs speeds processes.
But money is a tool. It‚Äôs a means to an end. For those engaging in work they truly believe in, money is simply a tool for doing more work.
What is your WHY for what you‚Äôre doing or pursuing?
How could you possibly know your why?
More importantly, how could you know your REAL WHY?
It‚Äôs actually quite simple.
But it takes some radical honestly.
There‚Äôs an exercise I‚Äôll walk you through to get to your WHY. And more importantly, once you know your deepest WHY for what you‚Äôre doing, you should operate FROM THAT STATE, not from your lower and base-level reasons.
When trying to understand why you do something, it‚Äôs better to ask ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù questions then ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù questions, because ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù questions tend to put people on the defensive.
Here‚Äôs a solid question you could ask yourself to understand your WHY.
What about ______________ is important to you?
Let‚Äôs say you want to start a business, or get a new cellphone, or go to the gym...
It could be big or small.
But put that thing in there.
What about ‚Äúgoing to the gym‚Äù is important to you?
Then, you just write the first thing that comes to your mind: because I like feeling good.
Then you take your answer, and put it in the same question: What about ______________ is important to you?
So, given the previous answer: What about ‚Äúfeeling good‚Äù is important to you?
A simple way to structure this exercise is shown in the images just below.
So, you want to try to go 7-layers deep. Once you get to layers 5, 6, and 7, you‚Äôre going to have to be really honest with yourself.
Usually, you can answer layers 1‚Äì4 with your head. However, if you‚Äôre being really honest with yourself, and I mean REALLY HONEST, you‚Äôll need to come from your heart to answer layers 5‚Äì7.
It‚Äôs at the deepest levels that you‚Äôll discover your TRUE WHY for what you‚Äôre doing. Even if that something is as simple as getting a new cellphone or going to the gym.
But you want to remind yourself of your DEEPEST WHY when you‚Äôre doing something. And you want to operate from THAT LEVEL, because at your deepest level, you‚Äôll be operating from your heart, not your head. Thus, your performance will be much deeper, more authentic, and powerful.
The stakes will be higher.
Suddenly, you‚Äôre not just going to the gym to ‚Äúfeel good,‚Äù but because you have a higher calling to perform and need to be as healthy as possible to make it happen (or whatever your deepest WHY is).
Your DEEPEST why will almost always expose something very personal about you, and about your fundamental beliefs about life.
You want to be aware of these things, and how/why they drive you to do what you‚Äôre doing.
If you truly go through this exercise in a genuine way, you should get some mental and emotional breakthroughs.
You should discover something about yourself, and why you are the way you are, and why you‚Äôre pursuing the specific things you are.
Know your why.
Then act from the DEEPEST and most powerful WHY you have.
You‚Äôll be far more brilliant at what you do.
In order to be successful, you must believe in something.
You must have a stand.
All successful people and brands have a clear WHY. As Simon Sinek explains in his book, Start With Why, people don‚Äôt buy what you sell, they buy why you sell it.
Apple is a great example. In all of their marketing, they don‚Äôt explain the technicalities of their products, they define and share their core values. They believe technology should be both easy to use and cool.
If you want to be compelling and interesting, you must truly believe in something. You must have a clear stand. That stand becomes your brand. It becomes your trademark. It becomes how you distinguish yourself from others.
When you have a clear stand and brand, you stand out. You are no longer neutral. You believe in something, and are fighting to make a specific change.
As a result, people will either love you or hate you. That‚Äôs what you want. Lukewarm means you have nothing to say. Lukewarm means you‚Äôre trying to appeal to everyone.
The riches are in the niches. Your niche is your audience. They are a small group of people who agree with the stand you‚Äôre trying to make. They are your evangelists.
If you try to appeal to everyone, your message, marketing, and products will be terrible. You won‚Äôt be clear on your why, and neither will anyone else. Thus, you‚Äôll be average like everyone else and your work won‚Äôt stand out.
Only people with firm stands get really really good at marketing. They care enough about their message to get it out there. They realize that the HOW is just as important as the WHAT and WHY.

Secret Sauce breaks down every channel just like this one, so if you think this is valuable check it out. It‚Äôs for sale now.
SEO is simply not as hard as people pretend like it is; you can get 95% of the effort with 5% of the work, and you absolutely do not need to hire a professional SEO to do it, nor will it be hard to start ranking for well-picked key terms.
Of all the channels we‚Äôll be discussing, SEO is the one that there is the most misinformation about. Some of it is subtle, but some of it is widely spread and believed by so-called SEO consultants who actually don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing.
SEO is very simple, and unless you‚Äôre a very large company it‚Äôs probably not worth hiring somebody else to do.
In order to understand what we need to do for SEO let‚Äôs look back at how Google started, how it‚Äôs evolving today, and develop a groundwork from which we can understand how to get ranked on Google.
The idea for PageRank ‚Äî Google‚Äôs early ranking algorithm ‚Äî stemmed from Einstein. Larry Page and Sergei Brin were students at Stanford, and they noticed how often scientific studies referred to famous papers, such as the theory of relativity. These references acted almost like a vote ‚Äî the more your work was referenced the more important it must be. If they downloaded every scientific paper and looked at the references, they could theoretically decide which papers were the most important, and rank them.
They realized that because of links, the Internet could be analyzed and ranked in a similar way, except instead of using references they could use links. So they set about attempting to ‚Äúdownload‚Äù (or crawl) the entire Internet, figuring out which sites were linked to the most. The sites with the most links were, theoretically, the best sites. And if you did a search for ‚Äúuniversity,‚Äù they could look at the pages that talked about ‚Äúuniversity‚Äù and rank them.
Google works largely the same way today, although with much more sophistication and nuance. For example, not all links carry the same weight. A link from an authoritative site (as seen by how many links a site has pointing at it) is much more valuable than a link from a non-authoritative site. A link from the New York Times is probably worth about 10,000 links from sites that don‚Äôt have much authority.
At the end of the day the purpose of Google is to find the ‚Äúbest‚Äù (or most popular) web page for the words you type into the search bar.
All this means is we need to make it clear to google what our page is about, and then make it clear that we‚Äôre popular. If we do that we win. In order to do that, we‚Äôll follow a very simple process that works every single time with less effort than you probably think is required.
Google is a very smart company. The sophistication of the algorithms they write is incredible; bear in mind that there are currently cars driving themselves around Silicon Valley powered by Google‚Äôs algorithms.
If you get too far into the SEO rabbit hole you‚Äôll start stumbling upon spammy ways to attempt to speed up this process. Automated software like RankerX, GSA SER, and Scrapebox, instructions to create spam or spin content, linkwheels, PBNs, hacking domains, etc.
Some of that stuff works very short term, but Google is smart and it is getting smarter. It gets harder to beat Google every day, and Google gets faster at shutting down spammy sites every day. Most don‚Äôt even last a week before everything you‚Äôve done disappears and your work evaporates. That‚Äôs not the way you should do things.
Instead of Internet-based churn and burn we‚Äôll be focusing on building equity in the Internet. So if you see some highly-paid SEO consultant telling you to use software and spun content to generate links, or when you see some blackhatter beating the system, just know that it‚Äôs not worth it. We‚Äôre going to build authority and get traffic fast, but we‚Äôre going to do it in a way that doesn‚Äôt disappear or cripple your site in the future.
The first step in getting our site ready to rank is making it clear to Google what our site is about.
For now we‚Äôre going to focus our home page (our landing page) on ranking for one keyword that isn‚Äôt our brand or company name. Once we do that and get that ranking we can branch out into other keywords and start to dominate the search landscape, but for now we‚Äôll stay laser focused.
The first thing we need to do is to figure out what that keyword is. Depending on how popular our site is and how long it‚Äôs been around, the level of traffic and difficulty we‚Äôll get from this effort may vary.
There‚Äôs a concept we need to be familiar with known as the ‚Äúlong tail.‚Äù
If we were to graph ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù of most things with ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù being the Y axis and the rank order being the X axis, we‚Äôd get something like a power law graph:
There are some big hits that get the majority of attention, and after a few hits the graph falls sharply. The long-tail theory says that as we become more diverse as a society the yellow end of the above graph will stretch forever and get taller.
Think of Amazon. They probably have a few best-selling products, but the majority of their retail revenue comes from a wide variety of things that aren‚Äôt bought anywhere nearly as often as their best-selling products. Similarly, if we were to rank the popularity of the songs played in the last 10 years, there would be a few hits that would garner the majority of plays, and an enormous number of songs that have only a few plays. Those less popular products and songs are what we call the long tail.
In SEO this matters because, at least in the beginning, we‚Äôre going to go after long tail keywords ‚Äî very exact, intention-driven keywords with lower competition that we know can win, then gradually we‚Äôll work our way to the left.
Our site isn‚Äôt going to outrank ultra-competitive keywords in the beginning, but by being more specific we can start winning very targeted traffic with much less effort.
The keywords we‚Äôre looking for we will refer to as ‚Äúlong-tail keywords.‚Äù
In order to find our perfect long-tail keywords, we‚Äôre going to use a combination of four tools, all of which are free.
The process looks like this:
Don‚Äôt be intimidated ‚Äî it‚Äôs actually very simple. For this example we‚Äôll pretend like we were finding a keyword for this book (and we‚Äôll probably have to build out a site so you see if we‚Äôre ranked there in a few months).
In this step we‚Äôre simply going to identify a few keywords that seem like they might work. Don‚Äôt concentrate too much on culling the list at this point, as most bad keywords will be automatically eliminated as a part of the process.
So since this is a book about growth hacking, I‚Äôm going to list out a few keywords that would be a good fit:
Growth hacking
Growth marketing
Internet marketing
Growth hacking guide
Growth hacking book
Book about growth hacking
What is growth hacking
Growth hacking instructions
That‚Äôs a good enough list to start. If you start running out of ideas go ahead and check out keywordshitter.com. If you plug in one keyword it will start spitting out thousands of variations in just a few minutes. Try to get a solid list of 5‚Äì10 to start with.
Now we‚Äôll plug each keyword into UberSuggest. When I plug the first one ‚Äî ‚Äúgrowth hacking‚Äù ‚Äî in, I get 246 results.
Clicking ‚Äúview as text‚Äù will let us copy and paste all of our keywords into a text editor and create an enormous list.
Go through that process with each keyword you came up with.
Now we‚Äôll assume you have 500+ keywords. If you don‚Äôt, try to start with something more generic and broad as a keyword, and you‚Äôll have that many quickly. Ideally you‚Äôll have over 1500.
Now that we have a pretty good list of keywords. Our next step is to figure out if they have enough search volume to be worth our while.
You‚Äôll likely notice that some are so far down the long tail they wouldn‚Äôt do much for us. For example, my growth hacking list came up with ‚Äú5 internet marketing techniques.‚Äù We probably won‚Äôt go after that one, but instead of guessing we can let Google do the work for us. This will be our weeding out step.
The Google Keyword Planner is a tool meant for advertisers, but it does give us some rough idea of traffic levels.
Google doesn‚Äôt make any promise of accuracy, so these numbers are likely only directionally correct, but they‚Äôre enough to get us on the right track.
You‚Äôll have to have an AdWords account to be able to use the tool, but you can create one for free if you haven‚Äôt use AdWords in the past.
Once you‚Äôve logged in, select ‚ÄúGet search volume data and trends.‚Äù
Paste in your enormous list of keywords, and click ‚ÄúGet search volume.‚Äù Once you‚Äôve done so, you‚Äôll see a lot of graphs and data.
Unfortunately the Keyword Planner interface is a little bit of a nightmare to work within, so instead we‚Äôre going to export our data to excel with the ‚Äúdownload‚Äù button and play with it there.
Now what we‚Äôre going to do is decide what traffic we want to go after.
This varies a bit based on how much authority your site has. So let‚Äôs try to determine how easy it will be for you to rank.
Go to SEMrush.com and enter your URL, looking at the total backlinks in the third column:
As a general rule (this may vary based on how old your site is, who the links are from, etc.), based on the number of links you have, this is the maximum level of ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù you should go after.
Number of Backlinks
Maximum Difficulty
< 30:<40
<100:40‚Äì50
<1000:50‚Äì70
1000+:70+
Go ahead and sort the data by difficulty, and eliminate all of the stuff that is too high for your site (don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll get those keywords later). For now you can simply delete those rows.
One important thing to note is that Google gives us this volume as ‚Äúexact match‚Äù volume. This means that if there is a slight variation of a keyword we will see it if the words are synonyms, but not if they are used in a phrase, so the traffic will be underestimated from what you would expect overall.
Now with that disclaimer sort the traffic volume highest to lowest, and from this data pick out five keywords that seem like a good fit.
Here are mine:
growth hacking strategies
growth hacking techniques
growth hacking 101
growth hacking instagram
growth hacking twitter
Mine all look the same, but that may not necessarily be the case.
Unfortunately the ‚Äúkeyword difficulty‚Äù that Google gives us is based on paid search traffic, not on natural search traffic.
First, let‚Äôs use Google Trends to view the keyword volume and trajectory simultaneously. You can enter all of the keywords at the same time and see them graphed against each other. For my keywords it looks like this:
The ones I‚Äôm most excited about are purple and red, which are ‚ÄúGrowth hacking techniques‚Äù and ‚ÄúGrowth hacking Twitter.‚Äù
Now we‚Äôll take a deeper look at what the competition is like for those two keywords.
In order to analyze how difficult it will be to rank for a certain keyword, we‚Äôre going to have to look at the keywords manually, one by one. That‚Äôs why we started by finding some long-tail keywords and narrowing the list.
This process gets a lot easier if you download the SEOQuake Chrome extension. Once you‚Äôve done that, do a Google search and you‚Äôll notice a few changes.
With SEOQuake turned on the relevant SEO data of each site is displayed below each search result.
We‚Äôre going to alter what is displayed, so in the left-hand sidebar click ‚Äúparameters‚Äù and set them to the following:
Now when you search, you‚Äôll see something like this
SEOQuake adds a ranking number, and the following at the bottom:
The Google Index: This is how many pages from this base URL Google has indexed
Page Links: The number of pages linking to the exact domain that is ranking according to SEMrush‚Äôs index (usually very low compared to reality, but since we‚Äôll be using this number to compare it wil be somewhat apples to apples)
URL Links: The number of pages pointing to any page on the base URL
Age: The first time the page was indexed by the Internet Archive
Traffic: A very rough monthly traffic number for the base URL
Looking at these we can try to determine approximately what it would take to overtake the sites in these positions.
You‚Äôll notice that the weight of the indicators change. Not all links are from as good of sources, direct page links matter much more than URL links, etc., but if you google around and play with it for a while you‚Äôll get a pretty good idea of what it takes.
If you have a brand new site it will take a month or two to start generating the number of links to get to page one. If you have an older site with more links it may just be a matter of getting your on-page SEO in place. Generally it will be a mixture of both.
Keep in mind that we‚Äôre going to optimize our page for this exact keyword, so we have a bit of an advantage. That said, if you start to see pages from sites like Wikipedia, you will know it‚Äôs an uphill battle.
Here are a couple of examples so you can see how you should think through these things, starting with ‚ÄúGrowth hacking techniques.‚Äù
Entrepreneur.com is definitely a big name, and ‚Äúgrowth hacking techniques‚Äù is in the title explicitly. This will be difficult to beat, but there are no links in the SEMRush index that point direct to the page.
(By the way, I wonder how hard it would be to write an article for entrepreneur.com ‚Äî I could probably do that and build a few links to that easily, even linking to my site in the article).
Yongfook.com, have never heard of that site. 206 total links, not much traffic, this one I could pass up. It does have quite a bit of age and ‚ÄúGrowth hacking tactics‚Äù in the title explicitly, so that would make it tough, but this one is doable to pass up after a while.
Alright, so quicksprout is relatively popular, a lot of links, good age, lots of traffic, a few links direct to the page but not a ton.
But the word ‚Äútactics‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even appear here. This page isn‚Äôt optimized for this keyword, so I could probably knock it out by being optimized specifically for ‚Äúgrowth hacking tactics.‚Äù
Let‚Äôs jump down a ways to see how hard it would be to get on the front page.
17 total pages indexed? Created in 2014? No links in the index, even to the root URL? This one‚Äôs mine. I should be able to front-page easily.
So this looks like a good keyword. Now we just have to get the on-page SEO in place and start building a few links.
Now that we have our keyword selected, we need to make sure Google knows what our site is about. This is as simple as making sure the right keywords are in the right places. Most of this has to do with html tags, which make up the structure of a webpage. If you don‚Äôt know html or understand how it works, just pass this list to a developer and they should be able to help you.
Here is a simple checklist you can follow to see if your content is optimized.
‚òê Your keyword is in the <title> tag, ideally at the front (or close to the front) of the tag
‚òê Your keyword is close to the beginning of the <title> tag (ideally the first words)
‚òê The title tag contains less than the viewable limit of 65 characters (optional but recommended)
‚òê Your keyword is in the first <h1> tag (and your page has an <h1> tag)
‚òê If your page contains additional header tags (<h2>, <h3>, etc) your keyword or synonyms are in most of them
‚òê Any images on the page have an <alt> tag that contain your chosen keyword
‚òê Your keyword is in the meta description (and there is a meta description)
‚òê There is at least 300 words of text on the page
‚òê Your keyword appears in the URL (if not the homepage)
‚òê Your keyword appears in the first paragraph of the copy
‚òê Your keyword (or synonyms ‚Äî Google recognizes them now) is used other times throughout the page
‚òê Your keyword density is between .5% and 2.5%
‚òê The page contains dofollow links to other pages (this just means you‚Äôre not using nofollow links to every other page)
‚òê The page is original content not taken from another page and dissimilar from other pages on your site
If you have all of that in place you should be pretty well set from an on-page perspective. You‚Äôll likely be the best-optimized page for your chosen keyword unless you‚Äôre in a very competitive space.
All we have left now is off-page optimization.
Off-Page SEO is just a fancy way to say links. (Sometimes we call them backlinks, but it‚Äôs really the same thing.)
Google looks at each link on the web as a weighted vote. If you link to something, in Google‚Äôs eyes you‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúThis is worth checking out.‚Äù The more legit you are the more weight your vote carries.
SEOs have a weird way to describe this voting process; they call it ‚Äúlink juice.‚Äù If an authoritative site, we‚Äôll say Wikipedia for example, links to you, they‚Äôre passing you ‚Äúlink juice.‚Äù
But link juice doesn‚Äôt only work site to site ‚Äî if your homepage is very authoritative and it links off to other pages on your site, it passes link juice as well. For this reason our link structure becomes very important.
There are a number of tools that let you check how many links are pointing to a site and what the authority of those pages are. Unfortunately none of them are perfect ‚Äî the only way to know what links are pointing to your site is to have crawled those pages.
Google crawls most popular pages several times per day, but they don‚Äôt want you manipulating them, so they update their index pretty slowly.
That said, you can check at least a sample of Google‚Äôs index in the Google Search Console (formerly known as Webmaster Tools). Once you navigate to your site, In the left-hand side select ‚ÄúSearch Traffic‚Äù then ‚ÄúLinks to your site.‚Äù There‚Äôs a debate raging over whether or not this actually shows you all of the links Google knows about (I‚Äôm 99% convinced it‚Äôs only a sample), but it‚Äôs at least a representative sample.
To see all of your links, click on ‚ÄúMore‚Äù under ‚ÄúWho links to you the most‚Äù then ‚ÄúDownload this table.‚Äù This, again, seems to only download a sample of what Google knows about. You can also select ‚ÄúDownload latest links‚Äù which provides more recent links than the other option.
Unfortunately this doesn‚Äôt let us see much a to the value of the links, nor does it show us links that have dropped or where those links are from.
To use those there are a wide variety of tools: If you have a budget I‚Äôd go with ahrefs.com as they have the biggest index, followed by Moz‚Äôs Open Site Explorer (most of the data you can get with a free account, if not then it‚Äôs slightly cheaper than ahrefs), and finally SEMrush, which is free for most purposes we need. MajesticSEO uses a combination of ‚Äútrust flow‚Äù and ‚Äúcitation flow‚Äù which also works fairly well to give you an idea as to the overall health and number of links pointing to your site.
All of these use different internal metrics to determine the ‚Äúauthority‚Äù of a link, but using them to compare apples to apples can be beneficial.
HTML links look something like this:
<a href=‚Äùhttp://www.somesite.com‚Äù title=‚Äùkeyword‚Äù>Anchor text</a>
Where http://www.somesite.com is the place the link directs you to, the title is largely a remnant of time gone by, and the linked text ‚Äî think the words that are blue and you click on ‚Äî is called the ‚Äúanchor text.‚Äù
In addition to the amount of link juice a page has, the relevance of the anchor text matters.
Generally speaking you want to use your keyword as the anchor text for your internal linking whenever possible. External linking (from other sites) shouldn‚Äôt be very heavily optimized for anchor text. If 90% of your links all have the same anchor text Google can throw a red flag, assuming that you‚Äôre doing something fishy.
If you‚Äôre ever creating links (like we‚Äôll show you in the future) I only ever use something generic like the site name, ‚Äúhere‚Äù or the full URL.
Generally speaking you don‚Äôt want orphan pages (those that aren‚Äôt linked to by other pages), nor do you want an overly-messy link structure.
Some say the ideal link structure for a site is something like this:
That‚Äôs close, but it gets a couple things wrong. First, you‚Äôll never have a structure that organized, and second, in an ideal world every page would link to every other page on its same level. This can easily be done with a footer that feels like a sitemap or ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù pages. That allows you to specify anchor text, and pass link juice freely from page to page.
Unfortunately it‚Äôs impossible to draw such a web without it becoming a mess, so you‚Äôll just have to imagine what that actually looks like.
We have just one more thing to go over before we start getting those first links pointing to our site.
Most of SEO is managing stuff that can go wrong. There is a lot of that, but we‚Äôll go over what will cover 99% of needs, and you can Google if there‚Äôs something really crazy.
Robots.txt
Almost every site has a page at url.com/robots.txt ‚Äî even google has one.
This is just a plain text file that lets you tell search engine crawlers what to crawl and not to crawl. Most are pretty good about listening, except the Bingbot, which pretty much does whatever it wants no matter what you tell it. (I‚Äôm mostly kidding.)
If you don‚Äôt want Google to crawl a page (maybe it‚Äôs a login page you don‚Äôt want indexed, a landing page, etc.) you can just ‚Äúdisallow‚Äù it in your robots.txt by saying disallow: /somepage.
If you add a trailing / to it (e.g. disallow: /somepage/) it will also disallow all child pages.
Technically you can specify different rules for different bots (or user agents), but it‚Äôs easiest to start your file with ‚ÄúUser-agent: *‚Äù if you don‚Äôt have a need for separate crawling rules.
Disavow
Google will penalize spammy sites, and unfortunately this causes some bad behavior from bad actors. Say, for example, you wanted to take out a competitor. You could send a bunch of obviously spammy links to their site and get them penalized. This is called ‚Äúnegative SEO,‚Äù and is something that happens often in highly contested keywords. Google generally tries to pretend like it doesn‚Äôt happen.
In the case that this does happen, however, you can ‚ÄúDisavow‚Äù links in the Search Console, which is pretty much saying, ‚ÄúHey Google, don‚Äôt count this one.‚Äù I hope you‚Äôll never have to use it, but if you hire (or have hired) a bad SEO or are being attacked by a competitor, that is how you combat it.
Nofollow
A link can have a property called ‚Äúnofollow‚Äù such as this:
<a href=‚Äùhttp://www.somesite.com‚Äù title=‚Äùkeyword‚Äù rel=‚Äùnofollow‚Äù>Anchor text</a>.
If you want to link to somebody but you don‚Äôt want it to count as a vote (you don‚Äôt want to pass link-juice), or you support user-generated content and want to deter spammers, you can use a nofollow link. Google says it discounts the value of those links. I‚Äôm not convinced they discount them heavily, but other SEOs are so they seem to deter spammers if nothing else.
Redirects
If you‚Äôre going to change a URL, but you don‚Äôt want its link juice to disappear, you can use a 301 redirect. A 301 will pass a majority of the link juice.
Canonical URLs
If you have two pages that are virtually the same, you can add something like <link rel=‚Äùcanonical href=‚Äùhttps://www.someurl.com/somepage‚Äù> to say ‚Äúhey, treat this page as if it were that page instead, but I don‚Äôt want to 301 it.‚Äù
And with that, we‚Äôre ready to build our first links.
Link building is where SEO really starts to matter, and where a lot of people end up in a world of hurt.
The best way to build links is to not build links. I‚Äôve worked for companies in the past that don‚Äôt have to ask for them, they just flow in from press, customer blogs, their awesome blog posts, etc. If this is an option (and we‚Äôll go over a couple of ways to make it more likely) you‚Äôre in a great place.
If not, at least in the beginning, we‚Äôre going to manually create just a few.
We‚Äôre going to create them in legitimate ways and not hire somebody in India to do so. That is a recipe for disaster, and I can‚Äôt even count the number of times I‚Äôve seen that take down a site.
The easiest way to build high quality links are what SEOs call ‚Äúweb 2.0s.‚Äù That‚Äôs just a way to say ‚Äúsocial sites‚Äù or sites that let you post stuff. Now tweeting a link into the abyss won‚Äôt do you anything, but profiles, status pages, etc. do carry some weight. And if they come from a popular domain that counts as a link.
Some of the easiest are:
Twitter (in your bio)
Github (the readme of a repo)
YouTube (the description of a video ‚Äî it has to actually get views)
Wordpress (yes, you‚Äôll have to actually create a blog)
Blogger (same here)
Tumblr
Upvote-based sites (HackerNews, GrowthHackers, Inbound.org, etc.)
If nothing else you can start there and get a half dozen to a dozen links. There are always big lists of ‚Äúweb 2.0s‚Äù you can find online, but keep in mind if you‚Äôre going to build something out on a blogging platform you‚Äôre going to have to really build something out. That‚Äôs a lot of content and time, but you have to do it the right way.
We generally keep a bigger list of Web 2.0s here. Some may be out of date, but you should probably only build a half dozen to a dozen Web 2.0s anyway.
Another way to get link juice is by purchasing an expired domain. This is more difficult to do, but there are a lot of options such as expireddomains.net. (Google ‚Äúexpired domains‚Äù and you‚Äôll find dozens of sites monitoring them.)
You‚Äôll want to purchase a domain that has expired and restore it as closely as you can to its original form using an archive. These sites likely have some link juice to pass on and you can pass it to yourself.
Another way to find places you can build links is by using a link intersection tool. These find sites that link to ‚Äúcompetitor a‚Äù and ‚Äúcompetitor b‚Äù but not to you. Theoretically, if they link to both of your competitors, they should be willing to link to you. Moz, Ahrefs, LunaMetrics and others have link intersection tools that work quite well.
Now that we have a few basic links flowing, we‚Äôre going to work on some strategies that will send continual links and press, eventually getting to a point where we don‚Äôt have to build any more links.
Awesome ‚Äî you have a site that converts well, your SEO is in place, ready for you to drive traffic. Now what?
As you‚Äôre probably learned at this point, a site that converts very well but has no traffic flowing to it still converts zero traffic.
We‚Äôre going to fix that.
This section takes a lot of time and effort, and in the beginning you‚Äôll likely wonder if you‚Äôre doing anything at all. Remember that class in college that is so difficult it‚Äôs the point where most people give up, effectively weeding out the people who aren‚Äôt ready to major in a specific subject?
Well this is the weeder-out chapter of growth hacking.
The reason so many people stumble on this step is the same reason people stumble on so many steps that take a little effort under time ‚Äî losing weight, investing in a 401(k), etc. In the beginning you‚Äôre going to have a little seedling of traffic, and you‚Äôll be looking up to those who have giant oak trees, thinking, ‚ÄúI must be doing something wrong.‚Äù You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong. The traffic starts as a trickle before it becomes a flood.
But don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre a startup. Our goal is to get enough traffic that continuing to do this effort will be sustainable (meaning we won‚Äôt die before we start to see the rewards), but at the same time we‚Äôre building equity in the Internet.
The type of traffic we want to build is the type that will compound and will never go away. We want to create traffic today that will still give us a little trickle in five years. Combining hundreds (or thousands) of little trickles, our site that converts, and a great product we will create a giant river.
Future chapters will go into depth on the networks we need to drive traffic from, so in this chapter we‚Äôre going to focus on traffic that‚Äôs network-agnostic. Traffic that we can‚Äôt get by tapping any specific network.
Just to give you some idea of scale, I‚Äôve seen this process drive over 500,000 visits per day, though the build up to that level took almost a full year. What could you do with 500,000 visits per day?
To start we‚Äôre going to use the keywords we found in the SEO chapter, and inject ourselves (and our company) into the conversation wherever it‚Äôs taking place.
To do this we‚Äôre going to use software called BuzzBundle.
This software lets us do a few things:
This step takes thought, effort, and a real human who understands what they‚Äôre typing. I don‚Äôt often say this, but you cannot effectively automate this step without it becoming spammy. If you‚Äôre trying to replicate the automated SEO spam you‚Äôve seen on various blogs and sites this will probably work, but you‚Äôll get banned, your clickthrough will be a fraction of what it could be, and you‚Äôll be banned
We‚Äôre not going to fire up some awful software to drop spun mentions of garbage onto various comment sections online hoping that brings us SEO traffic. Our comments must do two things:
If you do these two things a few changes will take place: First, you‚Äôll notice that people click on your links because you‚Äôre a thoughtful person who likes to contribute. Second, people will respect your company because you‚Äôre a thoughtful person who likes to contribute.
And with that disclaimer, we‚Äôll move on to the nitty gritty of how this is done.
Now that all of that is out of the way, let‚Äôs fire up BuzzBundle and get to work.
The first thing you‚Äôll want to do in BuzzBundle is go to Accounts -> Add new accounts. This is the starting point for everything we‚Äôll do, as we need accounts to comment.
One thing you‚Äôll notice about BuzzBundle is that it lets you use multiple accounts. I find it beneficial to think from multiple perspectives and therefore multiple points of view, but I don‚Äôt want to go too far overboard and be spammy.
I‚Äôd recommend doing something simple ‚Äî create 2‚Äì3 personas, each of whom you identify with (or are you), and enter them into your BuzzBundle accounts.
Personally I don‚Äôt even change my name, I just use a different one (eg. Austen J. Allred vs. Austen Allred) or use a few photos, just so it isn‚Äôt literally the same name and same photo blanketing the Internet.
Disqus is a comment system used all over the place, and it carries some caveates. Disqus will ban you if you use the same link in every post, so there are two workarounds:
Both of these work, but the second one is much easier in my view.
Using links with our UTM parameters here will be very beneficial. We‚Äôll be able to track traffic back to each individual blog or site, and if necessary double down on the ones that are driving traffic.
If you ever start to run into problems with getting your link posted, it may be useful to use a few link shorteners or some 301 redirects.
To keep it simple you can use a link shortener that 301s such as bit.ly, or if you want to spend a little more time you can set up your own site and 301 the traffic from a certain page to your money site.
Let‚Äôs get started with the BuzzBundle.
First, it‚Äôs going to ask you for a keyword. We already have a keyword from the SEO section, but we may want to do something even a bit more generic. For this one I‚Äôm going to go with ‚Äúgrowth hacking.‚Äù
Simply hit ‚Äúgo‚Äù and let BuzzBundle get started.
It will load different content types into different columns, but generally we are going to be scrolling through until we find something that looks compelling and like we can actually contribute to.
The first thing I clicked on was this:
It‚Äôs a review of another book about growth hacking. All I had to do was comment, tag the author, ask him if he were willing to review our book, and offer to send him one for free. (If you‚Äôre reading this now it‚Äôs going to be pretty awkward).
My assumption is this person will find the conversation to be completely authentic, because it is. The fact that there‚Äôs now a link on his video that people who are searching for something else will find is just an added bonus.
As an aside, I much prefer to hold ‚Äúshift‚Äù and click on a link to open it in my normal browser if I‚Äôm just going to be commenting as myself.
The next one I found was a roundup of great growth hacking blog posts from the week.
I left the following comment:
Note how I followed him on Twitter so that it‚Äôs obviously personal and not an automated spam comment. I even went a little bit overboard and tweeted at him just for kicks.
That is how you get people on your team.
As you get further along and have an idea of how to get a good response, I‚Äôd recommend starting to sort by reach, ramping up the number of keywords you‚Äôre searching for, and possibly even gasp upgrading to the paid version of BuzzBundle.

Right? Why else go through all the pain and hardship? It‚Äôs to achieve happiness in some way.
And I‚Äôm not the only person who believed that. In fact, if you look around you, most people are pursuing happiness in their lives.
That‚Äôs why we collectively buy shit we don‚Äôt need, go to bed with people we don‚Äôt love, and try to work hard to get approval of people we don‚Äôt like.
Why do we do these things? To be honest, I don‚Äôt care what the exact reason is. I‚Äôm not a scientist. All I know is that it has something to do with history, culture, media, economy, psychology, politics, the information era, and you name it. The list is endless.
Let‚Äôs just accept that. Most people love to analyze why people are not happy or don‚Äôt live fulfilling lives. I don‚Äôt necessarily care about the why.
I care more about how we can change.
Just a few short years ago, I did everything to chase happiness.
But at the end of the day, you‚Äôre lying in your bed (alone or next to your spouse), and you think: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next in this endless pursuit of happiness?‚Äù
Well, I can tell you what‚Äôs next: You, chasing something random that you believe makes you happy.
It‚Äôs all a facÃßade. A hoax. A story that‚Äôs been made up.
Did Aristotle lie to us when he said:
I think we have to look at that quote from a different angle. Because when you read it, you think that happiness is the main goal. And that‚Äôs kind of what the quote says as well.
Happiness can‚Äôt be a goal in itself. Therefore, it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs achievable.
I believe that happiness is merely a byproduct of usefulness.
When I talk about this concept with friends, family, and colleagues, I always find it difficult to put this into words. But I‚Äôll give it a try here.
Most things we do in life are just activities and experiences.
Those things should make you happy, right? But they are not useful. You‚Äôre not creating anything. You‚Äôre just consuming or doing something. And that‚Äôs great.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I love to go on holiday, or go shopping sometimes. But to be honest, it‚Äôs not what gives meaning to life.
What really makes me happy is when I‚Äôm useful. When I create something that others can use. Or even when I create something I can use.
For the longest time I found it difficult to explain the concept of usefulness and happiness. But when I recently ran into a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, the dots finally connected.
Emerson says:
And I didn‚Äôt get that before I became more conscious of what I‚Äôm doing with my life. And that always sounds heavy and all. But it‚Äôs actually really simple.
Did you do useful things in your lifetime? You don‚Äôt have to change the world or anything. Just make it a little bit better than before you were born.
If you don‚Äôt know how, here are some ideas.
That‚Äôs just some stuff I like to do. You can make up your own useful activities.
You see? It‚Äôs not anything big. But when you do little useful things every day, it adds up to a life that is well lived. A life that mattered.
The last thing I want is to be on my deathbed and realize there‚Äôs zero evidence that I ever existed.
Recently I read Not Fade Away by Laurence Shames and Peter Barton. It‚Äôs about Peter Barton, the founder of Liberty Media, who shares his thoughts about dying from cancer.
It‚Äôs a very powerful book and it will definitely bring tears to your eyes. In the book, he writes about how he lived his life and how he found his calling. He also went to business school, and this is what he thought of his fellow MBA candidates:
You can say that about all of us. And after he realized that in his thirties, he founded a company that turned him into a multi-millionaire.
Another person who always makes himself useful is Casey Neistat. I‚Äôve been following him for a year and a half now, and every time I watch his YouTube show, he‚Äôs doing something.
He also talks about how he always wants to do and create something. He even has a tattoo on his forearm that says ‚ÄúDo More.‚Äù
Most people would say, ‚Äúwhy would you work more?‚Äù And then they turn on Netflix and watch back to back episodes of Daredevil.
Being useful is a mindset. And like with any mindset, it starts with a decision. One day I woke up and thought to myself: What am I doing for this world? The answer was nothing.
And that same day I started writing. For you it can be painting, creating a product, helping elderly, or anything you feel like doing.
Don‚Äôt take it too seriously. Don‚Äôt overthink it. Just DO something that‚Äôs useful. Anything.

And how to make it a habit

Somebody once asked Warren Buffett about his secret to success. Buffett pointed to a stack of books and said,
When I first found this quote of Buffett‚Äôs two years ago, something was wrong.
It was December 2014. I‚Äôd found my dream job. Some days, I would be there, sitting at my dream job, and I would think. My god, what if I‚Äôm still here in 40 years? I don‚Äôt want to die like this...
Something wasn‚Äôt right. I‚Äôd followed the prescription: Good grades. Leadership. Recommendations. College. Dream job. I was a winner. I‚Äôd finished the race. Here I was in the land of dreams. But something was terribly, terribly wrong.
In January of 2015, I found Buffett‚Äôs quote. I decided to read. I was going to read and read and read and never stop until I got some damn answers.
I didn‚Äôt quite make 500 pages a day, but, in these last two years, I‚Äôve read over 400 books, cover to cover. That decision to start reading was one of the most important decisions in my life.
Books gave me the courage to travel. Books gave me the conviction to quit my job. Books gave me role models and heroes and meaning in a world where I had none.
I want to say reading 200 books a year is an amazing thing. But the truth is, it‚Äôs not. Anybody can do it.
All it takes is some simple math and the right tools.
When the average Joe hears the advice ‚ÄúRead 500 pages every day,‚Äù his snap reaction is, ‚ÄúNo way! That‚Äôs impossible!‚Äù
Joe will then go on to make up reasons to justify his belief without doing any deep thinking at all. These might include ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too busy,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not smart enough,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBooks just aren‚Äôt for me.‚Äù
But what if we go a little deeper? For example, what does it actually take to read 200 books a year? Before I began this project two years ago, I stopped to do the math. Here‚Äôs what I found: Reading 200 books a year isn‚Äôt hard at all.
It‚Äôs just like Buffett says. Anyone can do it, but most people won‚Äôt.
How long does it take to read 200 books a year?
First, let‚Äôs look at two quick statistics:
Now, all we need are some quick calculations...
That‚Äôs all there is to it. To read 200 books, simply spend 417 hours a year reading.
I know, I know. If your brain is like mine, it probably saw ‚Äú417 hours‚Äù and immediately tried to shut off. Most people only work 40 hours a week! How can we possibly read for 417 hours?
I mean, 417 hours sure feels like a lot. But is it, really? Let‚Äôs try to get some more perspective.
Here‚Äôs how much time the average American spends on social media and TV in a year:
Wow. That‚Äôs 3442.5 hours a year spent on TRASH. If those hours were spent reading instead, you could be reading over 1600 books a year!
Here‚Äôs the simple truth behind reading a lot of books: It‚Äôs not that hard. We have all the time we need. The scary part ‚Äî the part we all ignore ‚Äî is that we are too addicted, too weak, and too distracted to do what we all know is important.
All it takes to start reading more is to take ‚Äúempty time‚Äù spent Twitter-stalking celebrities or watching Desperate Housewives and convert some of it to reading time.
The theory is simple. It‚Äôs the execution that‚Äôs hard.
We all know reading is important. We all know we should do more of it. But we don‚Äôt. The main reason this happens is a failure to execute.
I‚Äôm not so perfect at it yet, but here are some tactics that have helped me get results.
If you were quitting cocaine, would you keep it lying around the house? Of course not. Media is designed to be addictive. Moving away from media addiction can be as difficult as quitting drugs.
The biggest bang-for-buck changes here are environmental.
If you want to read, make sure (1) you remove all distractions from your environment and (2) you make books as easy to access as possible.
As an example, here‚Äôs my immediate environment:
I travel a lot. That doesn‚Äôt stop me from reading. The picture on the left is of my ‚Äúbookshelf‚Äù in Thailand. I try to keep books everywhere so I can just pick one up and start reading.
The picture on the right is my smartphone desktop. Notice there are only two apps. One of them ‚Äî the Kindle app ‚Äî is for reading. The other is for habits... Which brings me to my next point.
Willpower is not a good tool for lifestyle change. It always fails you when you need it most. Instead of relying on strength of mind, build a fortress of habits ‚Äî these are what will keep you resilient in tough times.
If you‚Äôre not familiar with habit science, my favorite book on the subject is Tynan‚Äôs Superhuman by Habit. It‚Äôs infinitely practical, and practical is all I care about.
Getting good at habit-forming took me years. Many of the mistakes I made were avoidable. If I could go back, I‚Äôd find a habit coach. Here‚Äôs how I see it. One game-changing idea from a good book is worth thousands of dollars. If a coach helps you read ONE more good book a year, you already get your money‚Äôs worth. (A shout out to Cherry Jeffs and Nathan Sudds, two coaches that have helped me out a lot.)
When it comes to reading, be a jack of all trades, not a specialist.
If your goal is to read more, you can‚Äôt be picky about where you read or what mediums you use. I read paper books. I read on my phone. I listen to audiobooks. And I do these things everywhere ‚Äî on park benches, in buses, on the toilet... wherever I can.
Make your reading opportunistic. If you have a chance, take it. If you don‚Äôt have a chance, find one.
If I hadn‚Äôt started reading, perhaps I‚Äôd still be at my dream job. Perhaps I‚Äôd still be at my desk, taking peeks at the clock and wondering if that was how I was going to die.
If you‚Äôre in a similar position, give reading a try. You may find much, much more than you were looking for.

Alex Birsan|60K|7|https://medium.freecodecamp.org/messing-with-the-google-buganizer-system-for-15-600-in-bounties-58f86cc9f9a5?source=tag_archive---------9---------------------|How I hacked Google‚Äôs bug tracking system itself for $15,600 in bounties|"Have you ever heard of the Google Issue Tracker? Probably not, unless you‚Äôre a Google employee or a developer who recently reported bugs in Google tools. And neither had I, until I noticed my vulnerability reports were now being handled by opening a new thread there, in addition to the usual email notifications.
So I immediately started trying to break it.
So what exactly is this website? According to the documentation, the Issue Tracker (internally called Buganizer System) is a tool used in-house at Google to track bugs and feature requests during product development. It is available outside of Google for use by external public and partner users who need to collaborate with Google teams on specific projects.
In other words, when someone has an issue with a Google product, it goes in the issue tracker. Makes sense, right? We, as external users, only get to see the tip of the iceberg: A small set of pre-approved categories, and issues where someone at Google explicitly added an external account, such as vulnerability reports. But how much information lies under the surface?
By observing numerical IDs assigned to the latest public threads, we can easily estimate how much usage this tool gets internally. There are about 2000‚Äì3000 issues per hour being opened during the work hours in Mountain View, and only 0.1% of them are public. Seems like a data leak in this system would have a pretty big impact. Let‚Äôs break it!
One of the first things I noticed upon discovering the issue tracker was the ability to participate in discussions by sending emails to a special address, which looks like this:
buganizer-system+componentID+issueID@google.com
(in which componentID is a number representing a category, and issueID is an unique identifier for the thread you are responding to)
This reminded me of a recent finding called the Ticket Trick, which allowed hackers to infiltrate into organizations‚Äô chat systems by leveraging this kind of email system. Considering that this is an @google.com email address, I tried signing up to Google‚Äôs Slack team using it, and the confirmation page I got to looked very promising:
Alas, no email from Slack ever showed up.
The next best thing I could think of was getting a Google account with an @google.com main email address, which would hopefully give me some extra privileges on the Buganizer. Registering such an account from outside Google was not supposed to be allowed:
However, I found a method to bypass this filter: If I signed up with any other fake email address, but failed to confirm the account by clicking on a link received by email, I was allowed to change my email address without any limitations. Using this method, I changed the email of a fresh Google account to buganizer-system+123123+67111111@google.com.
Soon after, I received the confirmation email as a message on the corresponding issue page:
Nice! I clicked the confirmation link, logged in on the Issue Tracker, and ...
I got redirected to the corporate login page. And no, my Google account credentials did not work there. Bummer.
Nevertheless, this account gave me a lot of extra benefits in other places across the internet, including the ability to hitch a ride (for free, maybe?), so it was still a security problem that opened a lot of doors for malicious users.
Accepted: 11 hours | Bounty: $3,133.7 | Priority: P1
Another Issue Tracker feature that caught my eye while getting familiar with the UI is the ability to star items. Starring an issue means you‚Äôre interested in the problem being discussed and you want to receive email notifications whenever someone adds a comment.
The interesting thing I noticed about this functionality was the distinct lack of errors when trying to use it on issues I did not have access to. Access control rules never seemed to be applied on this endpoint, so I logged in to my second account and tried to star a vulnerability report from my main account by replacing the Issue ID in the request. I then saw this message, which means the action had been successful:
Could it be that easy to spy on open Google vulnerabilities? I quickly posted a comment on the issue to see if I my fictional attacker account would get notified about it.
But again, no email ever showed up.
For some reason that I genuinely can‚Äôt remember, I decided to do some further testing on this one. So I got a recent issue ID, and extrapolated a range of a few thousand IDs which should coincide with the latest issues in the database. I then starred them all.
In a matter of minutes, my inbox looked like this:
My first thought when opening the inbox was ‚ÄúJackpot!‚Äù.
However, upon closer inspection, there was nothing particularly interesting going on in those threads. Apparently, I could only eavesdrop on translation-related conversations, where people would debate the best ways to convey the meaning of a phrase in different languages.
I even considered not reporting this for a few hours, hoping I would find a way to escalate the severity. In the end, I realized that the Google security team would probably be interested in finding possible pivot methods and variants, so I sent out the details.
Accepted: 5 hours | Bounty: $5,000 | Priority: P0
When you visit the Issue Tracker as an external user, most of its functionality is stripped away, leaving you with extremely limited privileges. If you want to see all the cool stuff Google employees can do, you can look for API endpoints in the JavaScript files. Some of these functions are disabled completely, others are simply hidden in the interface.
When designing this limited version of the system, someone was nice enough to leave in a method for us remove ourselves from the CCs list, in case we lose interest in an issue or don‚Äôt want to receive emails about it any more. This could be achieved by sending a POST request like this:
However, I noticed some oversights here that led to a huge problem:
I could now see details about every issue in the database by replacing issueIds in the request above. Bingo!
I only tried viewing a few consecutive IDs, then attacked myself from an unrelated account to confirm the severity of this problem.
Yes, I could see details about vulnerability reports, along with everything else hosted on the Buganizer.
Even worse, I could exfiltrate data about multiple tickets in a single request, so monitoring all the internal activity in real time probably wouldn‚Äôt have triggered any rate limiters.
I promptly sent the exploit details to Google, and their security team had the affected endpoint disabled one hour later. Impressive response time!
Accepted: 1 hour | Bounty: $7,500 | Priority: P0
When I first started hunting for this information leak, I assumed it would be the Holy Grail of Google bugs, because it discloses information about every other bug (for example, HackerOne pays a minimum of $10,000 for something similar).
But after finding it, I quickly realized that the impact would be minimized, because all the dangerous vulnerabilities get neutralized within the hour anyway.
I‚Äôm very happy with the extra cash, and looking forward to finding bugs in other Google products.

Nir Eyal|439|5|https://medium.com/pminsider/abolish-the-reference-check-de55451c84d0?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|Abolish the reference check ‚Äì Product Management Insider ‚Äì Medium|"It‚Äôs time to abolish the reference check. The unpleasant process of calling up a job applicant‚Äôs former boss to gab about the candidate‚Äôs pluses and ‚Äúdeltas‚Äù is just silly. Maybe if we all just agree to stop doing it, the practice will go away, like pay phones and fanny packs. Instead, I‚Äôve learned a better way to hire that leverages a universal human attribute ‚Äî namely, the fact that we‚Äôre all lazy.
What‚Äôs my beef with reference checks? They don‚Äôt accomplish the job we intend them to do. In a startup, you can‚Äôt afford to hire B-players. But reference checks, which are intended to do the screening, fail to eliminate these candidates who are just so-so. This happens because the person giving the reference has no incentive to say anything but good things about the candidate. Telling the whole truth, warts and all, could expose the former boss to a defamation lawsuit. But legal action aside, no one likes to speak poorly about an ex-colleague. It‚Äôs bad karma and just feels icky.
Instead of asking a reference to call you and spend an awkward half-hour chitchatting about pretty much nothing, try a technique I‚Äôve come to call it the ‚Äúaverage-need-not-apply‚Äù method. Though I‚Äôm not sure who invented it, the approach was taught to me by Irv Grousbeck at Stanford.
First, send the email below to people who have worked with the candidate. This can include the references he or she provided, but it‚Äôs a good idea to find other people who‚Äôve worked with the candidate as well. I‚Äôd recommend letting the candidate know you may reach out to people they‚Äôve worked with who are not on their list of references and confirm that‚Äôs ok with them. LinkedIn makes finding former co-workers a snap, and the more people you send it to, the better it will work.
After you send this email, one of the following three things will happen:
Scenario A: It‚Äôs most likely that you will hear nothing back from the reference.
Congratulations! You saved yourself from hiring a B-player, or worse. You also saved yourself and the reference from having to conduct an uncomfortable, time-wasting phone call.
Scenario B: You receive an email back from the reference informing you that the candidate was in fact exceptional and they‚Äôd be happy to tell you more.
Congratulations! Looks like you found a star, now it‚Äôs time to have a chat to confirm the candidate is as great as you think they are and learn more about your soon-to-be employee.
Scenario C: You receive a call within 5 minutes of sending your email asking if the candidate is on the market for a new job, and if so, can you have the candidate call the reference back ASAP.
Congratulations! You‚Äôve definitely found a winner. Don‚Äôt let the candidate return the call and make an offer immediately before someone else does. This scenario has actually happened to me a few times. It‚Äôs the best predictor of the quality of candidate I‚Äôve ever seen. We immediately made offers to those candidates and without fail they turned out to be our best hires.
So why does this method work? It leverages the power of choosing a default option. Research by Eric Johnson and Daniel Goldstein demonstrated how opt-in versus opt-out decisions dramatically affect participation in organ donation programs; using a default option in the reference check allows you to affect results in a similar way.
Unlike the traditional reference check method, which elicits an overly positive response in order to preserve social harmony, the ‚Äúaverage-need-not-apply‚Äù method uses the opposite bias. By giving the reference an easy default ‚Äî in this case doing nothing ‚Äî this technique gauges just how great the reference thinks the candidate is.
Those who have a strong positive opinion of a candidate take the time to write back. By using this method, an employer can collect more data points on the potential hire with just a few emails instead of scheduling phone calls. In my experience, the results are binary. Most of the emails yield glowing replies or radio silence; both speak volumes.
By utilizing a bit of behavioral engineering instead of performing the reference check, employers can make better hiring decisions and make the hiring process better for everyone involved ‚Äî except maybe the B-players.

Stephanie St.Claire|16.9K|11|https://medium.com/@StephStClaire/11-things-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-started-my-business-3dc264023df5?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|11 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started My Business ‚Äì Stephanie St.Claire ‚Äì Medium|"My name is Stephanie St.Claire, and I‚Äôm an unfunded entrepreneur. I‚Äôve been in business for seven years. To get here, I engaged in my own personal and tenuous renaissance (uh... divorce) and rediscovered my Core Purpose. In other words, I grew a pair of ladyballs, launched a business, and figured out how to turn my efforts into profit.
But there was a lot to learn, some of which wasn‚Äôt covered in Who Moved My Cheese?
Throw these four rockstars into a blender, and you‚Äôll have a composite sketch of me in the first three months of my business:
Glitter was literally shooting out of my eye sockets as I quit my PR firm job. Full of optimism, living in New York City, and surrounded by a tribe of friends who were also launching businesses, I felt it was the perfect time to make a bold move to entrepreneurship. I was now officially Living My Dream and Working For Myself, which meant I was in charge of my financial destiny and Captain of My Promising Future.
Luckily, my initial hyperoptimism buoyed me whilst, oscillating between euphoria and despair, I was slowly but systematically forced off The Magic School Bus and onto the S.S. Battleship Long Haul.
I was a quick and eager learner, but despite the hours of webinar watching, countless Friday nights pumping out site copy, and teaching myself everything I could about HTML, there were just some things I didn‚Äôt get. I had to fall on my ass to procure the ‚Äúmaster‚Äôs degree in life survival‚Äù every entrepreneur earns on their ‚Äújourney.‚Äù (Yes, those are bitterly gesticulated air quotes.)
Here are 11 things I wish I knew when I started my business. I hope they will save you some time, and at the very least, some anguish because ‚Äî experience is a good teacher here ‚Äî the sodium from your tears acts as a corrosive melting agent on all brands of premium ice cream (though it does make a superb saline for your dirty martini). Cry over a cup, oh fathomless bird of preneurial gumption!
Your success (and financial stability) will come from expertly running your business ‚Äî not writing copy, rebranding your client‚Äôs website, teaching yoga, podcasting, or making jewelry. In other words, you will spend 15 percent of your time doing what you love (your gift, in my case coaching and writing) and 85 percent marketing, administrating, selling, strategizing, and answering a shitload of email. Survival will hinge on how quickly you adopt this role of business owner first, creator of pretty things second.
This sucked for me because I wanted nothing to do with running a business. I just wanted to be a writer and a life coach who wrote and coached all day. I didn‚Äôt get it.
Entrepreneurship is the most life-changing relationship (like marriage or parenthood) that a person can have. You will be confronted overandoverandover with your fears, insecurities, crappy excuses, limitations, justifications, shitty integrity, and inefficient time management. The standard you held yourself to in the workaday world was good enough then, but it won‚Äôt be good enough to run your own business.
You will learn to accept yourself through all this because, in order to get up every day and create a profit, you will have to. Somehow, through that process of acceptance, while you‚Äôre busy putting yourself out there in spite of your flaws, your weaknesses will transform into assets. Slowly but surely, you will fall in love with yourself. Not in the over-hyped ‚ÄúSelf Love 2018‚Äù way, but in a quiet way that sneaks up on you after witnessing a thousand splinter-sized moments of transcending the baser aspects of yourself.
I heard the ‚Äútwo-year rule‚Äù when I started my biz, but I was confident I could do it in six months. I believed with every fiber of my glittery, go-gettin‚Äô heart that my work ethic (15-hour days, seven days a week) ‚Äî along with my talent, skills, and personal magic ‚Äî could rip a path to accelerated success. This was a leap of faith, one that was worth some express lane juju points from Heaven.
Jesus had other plans.
You won‚Äôt expect it, because you prepared for the long haul. You secured a business loan, or got some investors, or sold your house (cough, cough), or have one year‚Äôs worth of savings and have planned accordingly.
But then all of the sudden, amidst the puffy clouds and blue skies, your little twin engine Entreprenairplane will sputter, the needle on the gas gauge unexpectedly plummeting to zero, and you will only have one choice: land your plane on the wild, abandoned air strip called Bank Balance: 14 Dollars. And this will be the last place you ever thought you‚Äôd crash land, because didn‚Äôt you pass this test on No More Sephora Island?
The good news is this is a rite of passage that will launch you into the League of Business Badassery in which, once you are out of the money hellhole, you will be unstoppable. You‚Äôve been to the baddest prison there is, looked down the barrel of your worst fear, and stood your ground. You didn‚Äôt quit. You got up the next day, and you wrote your next post, created your next offering, and answered the email with zero dollars in your bank account.
There is nothing more beautiful than running out of money and realizing that you are doing your work because you‚Äôve got the guts to push through your worst fears when there is no evidence of security. You really, truly love what you do, and you‚Äôd do it for free if you had to. Irony is a sassy bitch, isn‚Äôt she?
Take a second job if it will give you peace of mind. Please don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre failing at your business ‚Äî learn from my mistake. I was so resistant to ‚Äúdividing my focus‚Äù or taking any action which I interpreted as undermining my commitment to being a successful writer and coach. Do you see the hellish mousetrap that was? I really thought that by making a Plan B, I was telling the Universe I wasn‚Äôt 100 percent serious about my success. I created a worse problem by allowing financial stress to gut me of my sanity.
If having a steady stream of part-time income would be in service to your peace of mind, do it.
I finally came to terms with the fact that I was being obnoxiously naiÃàve about how money, peace, survival, and timing all work together, and I got a second job. By doing this, I supernaturalized my own path to freedom and self-sustainability. And since I wasn‚Äôt freaking out about money anymore, I liberated more creative real estate in my brain to apply toward my business.
The biggest challenge you will deal with in running a business is your own resistance. Before you study anything about marketing, social media, money, or time management, read this book. You‚Äôll be treated to gems like this:
Researching, studying, and reading other people‚Äôs blogs is a form of resistance. In order to get clarity, you must act. Clarity does not come by learning more ‚Äî it comes by jumping in with your instincts and putting yourself out there, even if you don‚Äôt know exactly what you‚Äôre doing.
Block out the distractions (turn off the phone, social media, and email notifications) and take inspired action that feels tangible and measurable. Set a timer for 25 minutes and go to town on a task. Do not look up. Do not go to the bathroom. Do not cruise the fridge for cheese sticks. Get something done, despite the fact that at times you will feel like you are pissing into the wind. Piss into the wind four times a day, and you‚Äôll make a difference in your bottom line.
Scrutinize any joint project carefully and qualify the person you‚Äôre collaborating with (even if they are your friend and have higher social media stats than you). Get everything in writing before you embark on the project, with a clear division of labor and deadline dates. You will most likely be splitting the profits, so have two numbers in your head: The number you need to make in order to pay for your time, and the number you would like to make. Set the first financial deadline early so that you both have the freedom to walk away if the project isn‚Äôt going to be profitable. Have a transition strategy in mind so in case that happens and one of you wants to continue on with the project, there is a way to pass the baton gracefully.
Summed up: communicate about everything ‚Äî even though you‚Äôre friends, even though you love each other, even though you trust each other, even though you‚Äôve worked together at XYZ Company, because projects have a way of going sideways and making everyone a little custodial and overreactive.
I know you just want to spend all your days making hipster sarsaparilla-scented mustache wax, or needlepointing edgy throw pillows for Etsy, or writing your YA zombie novel, or life coaching entrepreneurs to stratospheric success, but if you don‚Äôt spend time marketing you will not make money.
This was my biggest weakness when I started. I thought marketing meant slimy sales letters with big arrows and opt-in boxes, and I couldn‚Äôt! I wouldn‚Äôt! So I put my head in magical fairyland sand, stubbornly insisting that my customers would be tractor-beamed into my budding practice by the pulsating, heavenly light that radiated from my vision boards and four blog posts.
And then I ate canned food and spaghetti for a long, long time.
What rescued me? Knowing what marketing personality I embody. There are three main types:
Once you have figured out your marketing personality, selling to your customers will be a thousand times easier because you will be working within your natural vibe. Learn how you like to market and stick to that. Do it consistently and often. Even if you hire a pro, you will be doing some marketing yourself. Keeping your website fresh and current is essential, so also learn how to work WordPress and HTML code. You will be in the guts of your website a lot.
Your inbox will explode. You care about everyone, but you can‚Äôt help everyone. Read: Not everyone is your customer. Your inbox will be a jumble of people who want to say thank you, people who want free stuff, and people who want your services. Your job is to quickly discern who‚Äôs who and respond in the most appropriate way.
Shorten the email back-and-forth as quickly as possible with potential clients. If your business is a consultancy where you are selling your time, I recommend having two form letters on hand that you can customize to the occasion: one for potential customers and the other for non-potential customer.
For Your Customers: Acknowledge the situation, request, or problem and extend an invite to a 20-minute call. Include your available dates, times, and phone number.
For Non-Customers: Acknowledge the situation, request, or problem and provide other resources, practitioners, blogs, or articles that would be a splendid fit.
I love connecting personally with my clients. In this area of business, I am 1997 all the way. I pick up the phone and talk to them live. I schedule all the calls on one day or after my regular client sessions. I have found this to save a colossal amount of time. In a 20-minute phone call, I:
Do you know how long that would take back-and-forth by email? Anywhere from five days to a month. Do not screw with your own time.
Do not work your business seven days a week. Cover your legal ass from day one. From time to time, forget everything you know about the ‚Äúright way‚Äù to run a business and run it like a neighborhood lemonade stand. Do not price your offerings around your personal ability to pay for it ‚Äî you are not your ideal customer. Work out perplexing issues in your business, and it will resolve problems in other areas of your life. Connect with other entrepreneurs and set up a Skype brainstorming session (with wine). Take a walk around the block every day at lunch. And lastly, if you want to be smarter in business, follow everything these two people do: Gary Vaynerchuk and Regina Anaejionu.

Brandon Chu|2.2K|8|https://blackboxofpm.com/the-black-box-of-product-management-3feb65db6ddb?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|The Black Box of Product Management ‚Äì The Black Box of Product Management|"There is a rite of passage in the product management world, where all PMs have experienced being asked:
‚ÄúWhat does a product manager do, anyway?‚Äù
I empathize with designers and engineers for asking this question. In their shoes, I would be just as skeptical, because a product manager‚Äôs activities are fragmented, and don‚Äôt reveal the true discipline beneath.
When I first started in product management, I didn‚Äôt even know I was doing it. Instead, I was a first time founder and thought I was just ‚Äúdoing startup‚Äù.
Later, when I interviewed for a PM job, some much more qualified people told me that I was, in fact, doing product management. I got the job. Early into that role, I was asked the infamous question above. I wasn‚Äôt offended; in fact, I was just as curious as them, so I started reading (and reading) about product management. The internet said many things:
I soaked it all in. I re-read Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager ‚Äî my bible of product management ‚Äî weekly, for the first few months.
And then I shipped, and shipped some more. And pretty soon I felt useful.
Years into that job, I started managing other product teams. Other PMs were now looking to me to define expectations, so that they could now respond to questions of why they existed. I offered a cocktail of the best posts I‚Äôd read, and examples of the experiences I‚Äôd had over the years.
I‚Äôm currently at Shopify in my third role in product, and again I find myself rethinking assumptions about what it is I truly do. Shopify is a true engineering culture, and has very few product managers relative to the size of the company. For perspective, my last company had 1:10 ratio of PMs to employees. Shopify (including directors) is closer to 1:80.
One of the best things about working here has been observing an alternative approach to how products can be built and shipped effectively. Shopify engineers and designers are incredibly talented, opinionated and independent, and learning to effectively work with them has forced me to change the way I perceive my craft.
It‚Äôs also forced me to figure out what shouldn‚Äôt change, and in doing so, push me to abstract away the what in favour of the why. This post isn‚Äôt about Shopify, nor is it about the how to be an effective product manager. It‚Äôs about why product management exists.
Product Management is the by-product of two exponential forces being exerted on a company.
Speed is an exponential force because with every period of time, more change is occurring than in the last. Similarly with scale; every extra feature, employee, or user is adding more complexity to the system than the last.
The reason product management as a career has been popularized in predominantly software companies, is because software is inherently fast and scalable.
The internet changed how software products were delivered to the market. Long gone are the days of annual releases and cardboard boxes on shelves. For the last two decades, teams have been writing code, deploying it, and giving updates to all their customers instantaneously.
Software development itself has a lowered bar of entry. Approachability of high level programming languages, and the prevalence of open source libraries has super charged developers with unprecedented productivity. At the same time, the infrastructure costs of building a functional product and deploying it has dropped to basically zero.
In this way, speed has two meanings: both how quickly you can get something to market with software development, and (critically) how competition forces companies to go faster to survive.
The reason why sub 50-person startups rarely have product managers is that the complexity is still manageable. The CEO and co-founders are still able to coordinate the company towards a focused problem and unleash the power of a scrappy startup upon it.
But as the company grows, complexity emerges as more features are added, customers become more diverse, and the team grows. And that complexity grows exponentially.
For example, how many meetings do you think a 20-person startup can have?
The answer shows why we suck at conceptualizing the exponential.
The problem the company solves grows in complexity as well. As teams solve high level problems, they spawn hundreds of derivative problems, all begging to be solved. The catch is the company can‚Äôt solve them all. Faced with hundreds of problems to solve, choosing where to focus quickly becomes the most important decision a company makes.
When you consider the simultaneous impacts of speed and scale on a company, it‚Äôs easy to conceptualize how things will eventually derail without someone thinking holistically about the company. Ultimately, that role is for the CEO, but when they‚Äôve reached their multi-tasking limits, who else can fill the void?
Sure, products need some oversight - got it. Why not just train everyone to be able to manage the product, why hire a specific role?
The short answer is that it‚Äôs harder than you think to manage a product, and it takes years of experience to become capable. Here‚Äôs the long answer:
The core competency of a product manager is truly understanding product development. That is, how to identify which problem to solve and how to work with a team to solve it.
Anyone who‚Äôs been through a few launches knows that despite the textbooks, a linear product development process like the one below is a fairy tale.
Even if you included feedback loops between the steps, the idea of neat and tidy sequential steps, where functional teams work together through a checklist is flawed. It simply does not fit into a world where technology is progressing exponentially.
I view modern product development as a system of interconnected disciplines, working in a network, to deliver on a user‚Äôs desire. Product managers are the API that facilitates communication in this network.
Each node represents a broad bucket of domain expertise, each with enough depth that people dedicate careers to master them. This is an important quality of product development in a company where speed and scale have reached critical mass: there‚Äôs too much to know, so only a team can effectively deliver a product.
The process of product development is how this system moves through time.
Product managers shepherd this system from problem identification through to product launch, ensuring that each node in the network is aware of the progression of the others, and that users increasingly want what is being developed.
Finally, organizational scale brings with it multiple teams. And an effective product development system coordinates and focuses those teams towards the company‚Äôs vision.
As the product development APIs, product managers support company wide efficiency by ensuring no duplication of effort, and sharing infrastructure to enable other teams to go faster.
Product managers spend years to develop the skills required to be responsible for this system. It‚Äôs a multidisciplinary, breadth over depth approach to learning.
In my career, I‚Äôve done all of: programming, UI design, UX research, financial modelling, business development, support, copy-writing, accounting, legal, contract negotiation, reporting, marketing, blog posts, FAQs, and product copy.
I‚Äôve been an expert in none, and achieved borderline competence in some. I knew just enough of each to be useful as an API, but never enough to be dangerous (in a good way). That‚Äôs the quintessential quality of a product manager‚Äôs skill set, one that makes it hard for builder types to grok exactly what value they bring.
A product manager‚Äôs multidisciplinary awareness enables them to communicate in whatever language is necessary to effectively deliver information across the team.
They‚Äôre also in the best position to assess the impact of change across the system. A recent conversation I had with Shopify‚Äôs CEO, expressed this pretty succinctly to me.
Exactly right.
In a world where speed is king and the world is changing exponentially, having time to develop consensus before action is often a luxury. Teams need critical decisions made on a daily basis in order to maintain speed, and those decisions have major trade offs and/or conflicting interests among stakeholders.
Driving those decisions is no one else‚Äôs job but the product manager‚Äôs.
Whereas the work of engineers and designers are easier quantified, because it‚Äôs difficult to observe a PMs impact over the short run, the ambiguity around Product Management will remain for some time.
One day, there may be graduate degrees and definite career paths to product management, but not today. Until then, companies will continue to scale, the world will continue to get faster, and sooner or later ‚Äúwe need someone to manage this‚Äù will get proposed.
If you‚Äôre a PM, don‚Äôt get butt-hurt the next time someone challenges your existence. Embrace ambiguity (you‚Äôre a PM, after all) and have confidence in your purpose.
Oh, and Shopify is hiring.

Tucker Max|369|9|https://medium.com/startup-grind/my-startup-made-200k-in-its-first-two-months-and-im-embarrassed-51173a0ffcf9?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|My Startup Made 200k In It‚Äôs First Two Months... And I‚Äôm Embarrassed|"It all started with a simple question from a frustrated entrepreneur:
She asked me these questions because I am uniquely qualified to answer them. First, I‚Äôm a writer: I‚Äôve written three #1 NY Times Best Sellers. But beyond that, I‚Äôm an entrepreneur: I started and exited a publishing company that established the current model for many very successful authors, like Hugh Howey‚Äôs deal with Simon & Schuster.
Because of these two facets, I get some version of this question on a nearly daily basis, and I have a canned answer to quickly get out of these conversations.
I tell people that sitting down to write is not an optional part of the book creation process‚Äîin fact, it‚Äôs the very point of the process‚Äîand that they can‚Äôt have something (a book) without doing the work necessary to create it (write it).
I usually say it in a disdainful tone, sneering at the laziness of people who presume that books are something they can just ‚Äúget‚Äù without having to do the hard work. I often throw in some version of the ‚Äúeveryone wants to be a star, but no one wants to do the work‚Äù quote that Mark Cuban made famous.
Melissa Gonzalez, the entrepreneur who asked me the question, was different. And this was not just some dinner. This was an LDV Entrepreneur Dinner (LDV is an invite-only organization run by Evan Nisselson, that brings together successful entrepreneurs with the stated intent of helping each other).
Nonetheless, fully bathing in my writer‚Äôs arrogance, I gave her my usual canned speech about ‚Äúhard work‚Äù and ‚Äúthe difficult process being part of the work.‚Äù When she rolled her eyes at me, I wondered what I had said that was so bad.
She stopped me and reframed her question:
This was a straight up call out... and she was exactly right.
I was not talking to some schmoe. This woman knew those lessons‚Äîshe‚Äôd built her own successful business, in the extremely competitive field of retail.
Here I was at dinner with 30+ entrepreneurs who are all more successful than me, and I was lecturing one of them about hard work, instead of thinking of a way to solve her problem.
I have seen the embarrassed amateur in the room, and he is me.
I was too flustered to brainstorm a solution in the moment, so I told her that I would think about it, and get in touch.
Because I got called out‚Äîand I was so clearly, embarrassingly wrong‚ÄîI ended up obsessing over her problem for weeks. Which of course got me nowhere. Finding ways to make the publishing process easy is doable, but all I kept coming back to was the fact that there was no way to write a book without putting in the time to write it. The writing is part of the process, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called WRITING a book.
I eventually gave up on finding a solution, and a few days later‚Äîafter I‚Äôd stopped thinking about it, of course‚Äîthe solution hit me, like a lightning strike:
I started unpacking all of this in my head with a little one-man Socratic method:
A. A book is just a collection of thoughts that are expressed in words, and assembled in the form of a finite, defined text.
A. Books‚Äîespecially non-fiction books‚Äîexist to take a singular, contained idea out of the head of the author, and put it into the head of readers.
A. Writing thoughts down in words and sentences is the process by which the ideas are put into books.
A. If books exist to transfer ideas from one head to another, AND writing is the way by which people commit their ideas to words to put into books‚Äîis there another way to get those thoughts into a book, without writing? How would that happen? Of course there is‚Äîtalking!!
A. If I can find a way for her to talk about her ideas, instead of write her ideas down, could I then give her a finished book? Can Melissa just talk about her ideas instead of writing them down? Of course she can!
The problem was that I didn‚Äôt really have a precise process to do this and, quite honestly, I wasn‚Äôt sure this was going to work.
But like Melissa said, this is what entrepreneurship is about: solving problems that give people what they want.
So I connected Melissa with a former employee of mine, Zach Obront, and the three of us decided to collaborate on this project, to test it and see what would happen.
Start to finish, the whole process took about 5 months. As we were working through this process, I told a few people I know about this idea, and all of them loved the idea, said I should do this as a company, and they wanted the same service.
Yeah, yeah ‚Äî everyone loves every start-up idea until it comes time to pay right?
Except two of them bought packages. Like...with real money...during the call.
A few weeks later, I went on a podcast to talk about a whole different subject. During that podcast, I talked about this idea for 20 minutes, sort of by accident. Off of that single episode, we sold four more packages, which meant six packages sold before we even confirmed to ourselves that we would offer this as a service to customers.
When you are selling a product before you even formally offer it to customers, you‚Äôre onto something. That is pretty much the definition of product-market fit.
Zach and I decided to call the company ‚ÄúBook In A Box‚Äù (now called Scribe Media) and officially started offering the services to customers in August 2014. In the next two months , we did more than $200k in revenue. I had a different publishing services company, and some other side projects I was working on, and I have shelved all of that. Now we focus on Scribe full time.
What‚Äôs really cool, at least to me, is how excited I am about this company. Not just because it‚Äôs making money. Yes, money is great, but in this case the money is only the proof of what matters in a new start-up idea: that you are creating real value for real people, by solving their real problems. It appears that Scribe does just that‚Äîa lot of people really want a book, but they don‚Äôt have the time, ability, or patience to do it the conventional way. We solve their problem.
Not only do we solve their problem, we do it in way that is easier and cheaper than anything else they can do. Take ghostwriting for example. To hire a ghostwriter, you‚Äôre going to pay at least $40k (and usually much more for a good one). You have no guarantees of quality or process with them, and they don‚Äôt do anything but help you write the book manuscript‚Äîno publishing, no marketing, nothing. You have to pay for that separately, from a different company. Our packages range from $15k to $25k‚Äîand we do everything necessary to create a professionally published book, with no work from the author aside from talking.
But as great as this is, you know what my overwhelming emotion is right now, even more than being excited?
I feel embarrassed.
I feel embarrassed because people have been asking the question ‚ÄúHow do I get a book‚Äù for almost a decade, and my answer that whole time has been some version of elitist sneering at their lack of work ethic. I wasn‚Äôt thinking like an entrepreneur, I was thinking like the type of person I always claim to hate‚Äîthe one who says the status quo is the only way, that you have to do it ‚Äúthe way it‚Äôs always been done.‚Äù
It‚Äôs really embarrassing, at least to me, that it took me this long to see what has been right in front of my face for years. The technology existed to do this from the first day I was asked that question, almost a decade ago, and I was too arrogant and fixed in my notions of what a ‚Äúwriter‚Äù had to be in order to see it.
But I guess that‚Äôs the benefit of being around the type of women and men you meet at the LDV dinners (or any good entrepreneurial event with good people)‚Äîsmart people help you see your own biases and weaknesses, so you can fix them.
And if you fix your own problem, chances are lots of other people have that same problem, and if you can fix their problem the same way you fixed yours, you provide real value to the world...and that is the best place to start a business.

At SOSV, we are very excited to work with each new team, and we like to make sure everyone is on board with the terms of our collaboration. So, in the interest of transparency (something we care very much about!), here‚Äôs an outline of the steps in our process: what applicants in our accelerator programs can look forward to from the time their application is submitted, to the start of their program.
Let‚Äôs use our HAX hardware accelerator as an example.
Applications Submitted Online (including video)
HAX accelerator receives over 500 applications each session. After an initial first review, we contact the most promising candidates.
Above all, there are some key traits we love to see in a HAX applicant:
Team
We look foremost for a strong and skilled team. We like a team who:
Product
We like to see a working prototype for a product that:
A working prototype is important. What ‚Äúworking‚Äù means varies, but it is useful proof. We don‚Äôt mind ugly if it‚Äôs key element works, or is close to working.
Typically the ‚Äúproduct‚Äù part and the demo is the first thing we look at. It tells us lots as it shows what you can already build, and the technical challenges you face. It also already suggests a market (and we are familiar with quite a few):
Check our portfolio and mention any concerns you have about competing with our existing investments. It‚Äôs a concern for us too.
HAX applicant teams come to us in varying stages of development: very young companies with fresh technology, teams that already have some traction in their market but need to expand their sales or reach, and even companies who have promising technology but haven‚Äôt quite found their market. We always have a mix in any accelerator class.
This process takes our partners an intense few weeks, after which around 100 of the most intriguing applicants move on to the next step: a thorough interview.
You‚Äôve Applied. What Happens Now?
We‚Äôre reviewing applications on a rolling basis. We will contact you if we feel there is a match. We typically pick the top 10‚Äì20% out of all applications for further conversation. The best applications include background on the founders, the idea, and investors, plus a vital video component. When we select applicants, it‚Äôs due to:
Once we feel that these traits are in an applicant, we set up initial calls with our HAX partners.
You will have questions, and we will also have questions.
We will get a sense if it‚Äôs a match on both sides. If we‚Äôre both happy with the first call, there will generally be a second call with a different HAX partner for a second opinion.
We know waiting is not fun, but unfortunately it is necessary, as candidates don‚Äôt all apply at the same time. We need to interview many teams and founders, across all time zones.
Following a full review, HAX selects 15 teams and sends a Letter of Intent to participate in the HAX accelerator and a Founder‚Äôs Agreement. These are the accepted teams for the next HAX class.
Letter of Intent
The Letter of Intent outlines the SOSV offer to accepted applicants for the accelerator program. It offers a blueprint of what‚Äôs required of participants, and what they can expect from SOSV in terms of both investment and support during the program. Participants must agree to the terms in order to move forward. Some important details are specified:
Information Needed From Participants
Expectations of Participants
Financial Agreement Between SOSV and Participants
The Letter of Intent lays out the important details of the financial agreement between SOSV and the company‚Äôs management team. The SOSV commitment level (dollars offered plus program resources and support costs) is translated into an equity stake in the company, usually 6% (for HAX). The percentages and dollar amounts are based on a formula applied across all portfolio companies.
The Letter of Intent also maps out the future high-level investment terms which will be detailed in the Share Purchase Agreement and Accelerator Contract for Equity which are the final agreements between SOSV and HAX accelerator participants.
Once all parties are clear on the financial terms and program commitment, the participating team signs the Letter of Intent and submits it along with any additional information requested.
SOSV then draws up the final Share Purchase Agreement and Accelerator Contract for Equity. After this we‚Äôre ready to go.
Teams can start packing and get ready to take their businesses to the next level!

Gabriel Weinberg|17K|36|https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|Mental Models I Find Repeatedly Useful ‚Äì Gabriel Weinberg ‚Äì Medium|"Update: I‚Äôm co-authoring a book about the mental models from this post. Get notified when the book comes out here.
Around 2003 I came across Charlie Munger‚Äôs 1995 speech, The Psychology of Human Misjudgment, which introduced me to how behavioral economics can be applied in business and investing. More profoundly, though, it opened my mind to the power of seeking out and applying mental models across a wide array of disciplines.
A mental model is just a concept you can use to help try to explain things (e.g. Hanlon‚Äôs Razor ‚Äî ‚Äúnever attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness.‚Äù). There are tens of thousands of mental models, and every discipline has their own set that you can learn through coursework, mentorship, or first-hand experience.
There is a much smaller set of concepts, however, that come up repeatedly in day-to-day decision making, problem solving, and truth seeking. As Munger says, ‚Äú80 or 90 important models will carry about 90% of the freight in making you a worldly‚Äêwise person.‚Äù
This post is my attempt to enumerate the mental models that are repeatedly useful to me. This set is clearly biased from my own experience and surely incomplete. I hope to continue to revise it as I remember and learn more.
How-to Use This List
I find mental models are useful to try to make sense of things and to help generate ideas. To actually be useful, however, you have to apply them in the right context at the right time. And for that to happen naturally, you have to know them well and practice using them.
Therefore, here are two suggestions for using this list:

Secret Sauce breaks down every channel just like this one, so if you think this is valuable check it out. It‚Äôs for sale now.
SEO is simply not as hard as people pretend like it is; you can get 95% of the effort with 5% of the work, and you absolutely do not need to hire a professional SEO to do it, nor will it be hard to start ranking for well-picked key terms.
Of all the channels we‚Äôll be discussing, SEO is the one that there is the most misinformation about. Some of it is subtle, but some of it is widely spread and believed by so-called SEO consultants who actually don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing.
SEO is very simple, and unless you‚Äôre a very large company it‚Äôs probably not worth hiring somebody else to do.
In order to understand what we need to do for SEO let‚Äôs look back at how Google started, how it‚Äôs evolving today, and develop a groundwork from which we can understand how to get ranked on Google.
The idea for PageRank ‚Äî Google‚Äôs early ranking algorithm ‚Äî stemmed from Einstein. Larry Page and Sergei Brin were students at Stanford, and they noticed how often scientific studies referred to famous papers, such as the theory of relativity. These references acted almost like a vote ‚Äî the more your work was referenced the more important it must be. If they downloaded every scientific paper and looked at the references, they could theoretically decide which papers were the most important, and rank them.
They realized that because of links, the Internet could be analyzed and ranked in a similar way, except instead of using references they could use links. So they set about attempting to ‚Äúdownload‚Äù (or crawl) the entire Internet, figuring out which sites were linked to the most. The sites with the most links were, theoretically, the best sites. And if you did a search for ‚Äúuniversity,‚Äù they could look at the pages that talked about ‚Äúuniversity‚Äù and rank them.
Google works largely the same way today, although with much more sophistication and nuance. For example, not all links carry the same weight. A link from an authoritative site (as seen by how many links a site has pointing at it) is much more valuable than a link from a non-authoritative site. A link from the New York Times is probably worth about 10,000 links from sites that don‚Äôt have much authority.
At the end of the day the purpose of Google is to find the ‚Äúbest‚Äù (or most popular) web page for the words you type into the search bar.
All this means is we need to make it clear to google what our page is about, and then make it clear that we‚Äôre popular. If we do that we win. In order to do that, we‚Äôll follow a very simple process that works every single time with less effort than you probably think is required.
Google is a very smart company. The sophistication of the algorithms they write is incredible; bear in mind that there are currently cars driving themselves around Silicon Valley powered by Google‚Äôs algorithms.
If you get too far into the SEO rabbit hole you‚Äôll start stumbling upon spammy ways to attempt to speed up this process. Automated software like RankerX, GSA SER, and Scrapebox, instructions to create spam or spin content, linkwheels, PBNs, hacking domains, etc.
Some of that stuff works very short term, but Google is smart and it is getting smarter. It gets harder to beat Google every day, and Google gets faster at shutting down spammy sites every day. Most don‚Äôt even last a week before everything you‚Äôve done disappears and your work evaporates. That‚Äôs not the way you should do things.
Instead of Internet-based churn and burn we‚Äôll be focusing on building equity in the Internet. So if you see some highly-paid SEO consultant telling you to use software and spun content to generate links, or when you see some blackhatter beating the system, just know that it‚Äôs not worth it. We‚Äôre going to build authority and get traffic fast, but we‚Äôre going to do it in a way that doesn‚Äôt disappear or cripple your site in the future.
The first step in getting our site ready to rank is making it clear to Google what our site is about.
For now we‚Äôre going to focus our home page (our landing page) on ranking for one keyword that isn‚Äôt our brand or company name. Once we do that and get that ranking we can branch out into other keywords and start to dominate the search landscape, but for now we‚Äôll stay laser focused.
The first thing we need to do is to figure out what that keyword is. Depending on how popular our site is and how long it‚Äôs been around, the level of traffic and difficulty we‚Äôll get from this effort may vary.
There‚Äôs a concept we need to be familiar with known as the ‚Äúlong tail.‚Äù
If we were to graph ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù of most things with ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù being the Y axis and the rank order being the X axis, we‚Äôd get something like a power law graph:
There are some big hits that get the majority of attention, and after a few hits the graph falls sharply. The long-tail theory says that as we become more diverse as a society the yellow end of the above graph will stretch forever and get taller.
Think of Amazon. They probably have a few best-selling products, but the majority of their retail revenue comes from a wide variety of things that aren‚Äôt bought anywhere nearly as often as their best-selling products. Similarly, if we were to rank the popularity of the songs played in the last 10 years, there would be a few hits that would garner the majority of plays, and an enormous number of songs that have only a few plays. Those less popular products and songs are what we call the long tail.
In SEO this matters because, at least in the beginning, we‚Äôre going to go after long tail keywords ‚Äî very exact, intention-driven keywords with lower competition that we know can win, then gradually we‚Äôll work our way to the left.
Our site isn‚Äôt going to outrank ultra-competitive keywords in the beginning, but by being more specific we can start winning very targeted traffic with much less effort.
The keywords we‚Äôre looking for we will refer to as ‚Äúlong-tail keywords.‚Äù
In order to find our perfect long-tail keywords, we‚Äôre going to use a combination of four tools, all of which are free.
The process looks like this:
Don‚Äôt be intimidated ‚Äî it‚Äôs actually very simple. For this example we‚Äôll pretend like we were finding a keyword for this book (and we‚Äôll probably have to build out a site so you see if we‚Äôre ranked there in a few months).
In this step we‚Äôre simply going to identify a few keywords that seem like they might work. Don‚Äôt concentrate too much on culling the list at this point, as most bad keywords will be automatically eliminated as a part of the process.
So since this is a book about growth hacking, I‚Äôm going to list out a few keywords that would be a good fit:
Growth hacking
Growth marketing
Internet marketing
Growth hacking guide
Growth hacking book
Book about growth hacking
What is growth hacking
Growth hacking instructions
That‚Äôs a good enough list to start. If you start running out of ideas go ahead and check out keywordshitter.com. If you plug in one keyword it will start spitting out thousands of variations in just a few minutes. Try to get a solid list of 5‚Äì10 to start with.
Now we‚Äôll plug each keyword into UberSuggest. When I plug the first one ‚Äî ‚Äúgrowth hacking‚Äù ‚Äî in, I get 246 results.
Clicking ‚Äúview as text‚Äù will let us copy and paste all of our keywords into a text editor and create an enormous list.
Go through that process with each keyword you came up with.
Now we‚Äôll assume you have 500+ keywords. If you don‚Äôt, try to start with something more generic and broad as a keyword, and you‚Äôll have that many quickly. Ideally you‚Äôll have over 1500.
Now that we have a pretty good list of keywords. Our next step is to figure out if they have enough search volume to be worth our while.
You‚Äôll likely notice that some are so far down the long tail they wouldn‚Äôt do much for us. For example, my growth hacking list came up with ‚Äú5 internet marketing techniques.‚Äù We probably won‚Äôt go after that one, but instead of guessing we can let Google do the work for us. This will be our weeding out step.
The Google Keyword Planner is a tool meant for advertisers, but it does give us some rough idea of traffic levels.
Google doesn‚Äôt make any promise of accuracy, so these numbers are likely only directionally correct, but they‚Äôre enough to get us on the right track.
You‚Äôll have to have an AdWords account to be able to use the tool, but you can create one for free if you haven‚Äôt use AdWords in the past.
Once you‚Äôve logged in, select ‚ÄúGet search volume data and trends.‚Äù
Paste in your enormous list of keywords, and click ‚ÄúGet search volume.‚Äù Once you‚Äôve done so, you‚Äôll see a lot of graphs and data.
Unfortunately the Keyword Planner interface is a little bit of a nightmare to work within, so instead we‚Äôre going to export our data to excel with the ‚Äúdownload‚Äù button and play with it there.
Now what we‚Äôre going to do is decide what traffic we want to go after.
This varies a bit based on how much authority your site has. So let‚Äôs try to determine how easy it will be for you to rank.
Go to SEMrush.com and enter your URL, looking at the total backlinks in the third column:
As a general rule (this may vary based on how old your site is, who the links are from, etc.), based on the number of links you have, this is the maximum level of ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù you should go after.
Number of Backlinks
Maximum Difficulty
< 30:<40
<100:40‚Äì50
<1000:50‚Äì70
1000+:70+
Go ahead and sort the data by difficulty, and eliminate all of the stuff that is too high for your site (don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll get those keywords later). For now you can simply delete those rows.
One important thing to note is that Google gives us this volume as ‚Äúexact match‚Äù volume. This means that if there is a slight variation of a keyword we will see it if the words are synonyms, but not if they are used in a phrase, so the traffic will be underestimated from what you would expect overall.
Now with that disclaimer sort the traffic volume highest to lowest, and from this data pick out five keywords that seem like a good fit.
Here are mine:
growth hacking strategies
growth hacking techniques
growth hacking 101
growth hacking instagram
growth hacking twitter
Mine all look the same, but that may not necessarily be the case.
Unfortunately the ‚Äúkeyword difficulty‚Äù that Google gives us is based on paid search traffic, not on natural search traffic.
First, let‚Äôs use Google Trends to view the keyword volume and trajectory simultaneously. You can enter all of the keywords at the same time and see them graphed against each other. For my keywords it looks like this:
The ones I‚Äôm most excited about are purple and red, which are ‚ÄúGrowth hacking techniques‚Äù and ‚ÄúGrowth hacking Twitter.‚Äù
Now we‚Äôll take a deeper look at what the competition is like for those two keywords.
In order to analyze how difficult it will be to rank for a certain keyword, we‚Äôre going to have to look at the keywords manually, one by one. That‚Äôs why we started by finding some long-tail keywords and narrowing the list.
This process gets a lot easier if you download the SEOQuake Chrome extension. Once you‚Äôve done that, do a Google search and you‚Äôll notice a few changes.
With SEOQuake turned on the relevant SEO data of each site is displayed below each search result.
We‚Äôre going to alter what is displayed, so in the left-hand sidebar click ‚Äúparameters‚Äù and set them to the following:
Now when you search, you‚Äôll see something like this
SEOQuake adds a ranking number, and the following at the bottom:
The Google Index: This is how many pages from this base URL Google has indexed
Page Links: The number of pages linking to the exact domain that is ranking according to SEMrush‚Äôs index (usually very low compared to reality, but since we‚Äôll be using this number to compare it wil be somewhat apples to apples)
URL Links: The number of pages pointing to any page on the base URL
Age: The first time the page was indexed by the Internet Archive
Traffic: A very rough monthly traffic number for the base URL
Looking at these we can try to determine approximately what it would take to overtake the sites in these positions.
You‚Äôll notice that the weight of the indicators change. Not all links are from as good of sources, direct page links matter much more than URL links, etc., but if you google around and play with it for a while you‚Äôll get a pretty good idea of what it takes.
If you have a brand new site it will take a month or two to start generating the number of links to get to page one. If you have an older site with more links it may just be a matter of getting your on-page SEO in place. Generally it will be a mixture of both.
Keep in mind that we‚Äôre going to optimize our page for this exact keyword, so we have a bit of an advantage. That said, if you start to see pages from sites like Wikipedia, you will know it‚Äôs an uphill battle.
Here are a couple of examples so you can see how you should think through these things, starting with ‚ÄúGrowth hacking techniques.‚Äù
Entrepreneur.com is definitely a big name, and ‚Äúgrowth hacking techniques‚Äù is in the title explicitly. This will be difficult to beat, but there are no links in the SEMRush index that point direct to the page.
(By the way, I wonder how hard it would be to write an article for entrepreneur.com ‚Äî I could probably do that and build a few links to that easily, even linking to my site in the article).
Yongfook.com, have never heard of that site. 206 total links, not much traffic, this one I could pass up. It does have quite a bit of age and ‚ÄúGrowth hacking tactics‚Äù in the title explicitly, so that would make it tough, but this one is doable to pass up after a while.
Alright, so quicksprout is relatively popular, a lot of links, good age, lots of traffic, a few links direct to the page but not a ton.
But the word ‚Äútactics‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even appear here. This page isn‚Äôt optimized for this keyword, so I could probably knock it out by being optimized specifically for ‚Äúgrowth hacking tactics.‚Äù
Let‚Äôs jump down a ways to see how hard it would be to get on the front page.
17 total pages indexed? Created in 2014? No links in the index, even to the root URL? This one‚Äôs mine. I should be able to front-page easily.
So this looks like a good keyword. Now we just have to get the on-page SEO in place and start building a few links.
Now that we have our keyword selected, we need to make sure Google knows what our site is about. This is as simple as making sure the right keywords are in the right places. Most of this has to do with html tags, which make up the structure of a webpage. If you don‚Äôt know html or understand how it works, just pass this list to a developer and they should be able to help you.
Here is a simple checklist you can follow to see if your content is optimized.
‚òê Your keyword is in the <title> tag, ideally at the front (or close to the front) of the tag
‚òê Your keyword is close to the beginning of the <title> tag (ideally the first words)
‚òê The title tag contains less than the viewable limit of 65 characters (optional but recommended)
‚òê Your keyword is in the first <h1> tag (and your page has an <h1> tag)
‚òê If your page contains additional header tags (<h2>, <h3>, etc) your keyword or synonyms are in most of them
‚òê Any images on the page have an <alt> tag that contain your chosen keyword
‚òê Your keyword is in the meta description (and there is a meta description)
‚òê There is at least 300 words of text on the page
‚òê Your keyword appears in the URL (if not the homepage)
‚òê Your keyword appears in the first paragraph of the copy
‚òê Your keyword (or synonyms ‚Äî Google recognizes them now) is used other times throughout the page
‚òê Your keyword density is between .5% and 2.5%
‚òê The page contains dofollow links to other pages (this just means you‚Äôre not using nofollow links to every other page)
‚òê The page is original content not taken from another page and dissimilar from other pages on your site
If you have all of that in place you should be pretty well set from an on-page perspective. You‚Äôll likely be the best-optimized page for your chosen keyword unless you‚Äôre in a very competitive space.
All we have left now is off-page optimization.
Off-Page SEO is just a fancy way to say links. (Sometimes we call them backlinks, but it‚Äôs really the same thing.)
Google looks at each link on the web as a weighted vote. If you link to something, in Google‚Äôs eyes you‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúThis is worth checking out.‚Äù The more legit you are the more weight your vote carries.
SEOs have a weird way to describe this voting process; they call it ‚Äúlink juice.‚Äù If an authoritative site, we‚Äôll say Wikipedia for example, links to you, they‚Äôre passing you ‚Äúlink juice.‚Äù
But link juice doesn‚Äôt only work site to site ‚Äî if your homepage is very authoritative and it links off to other pages on your site, it passes link juice as well. For this reason our link structure becomes very important.
There are a number of tools that let you check how many links are pointing to a site and what the authority of those pages are. Unfortunately none of them are perfect ‚Äî the only way to know what links are pointing to your site is to have crawled those pages.
Google crawls most popular pages several times per day, but they don‚Äôt want you manipulating them, so they update their index pretty slowly.
That said, you can check at least a sample of Google‚Äôs index in the Google Search Console (formerly known as Webmaster Tools). Once you navigate to your site, In the left-hand side select ‚ÄúSearch Traffic‚Äù then ‚ÄúLinks to your site.‚Äù There‚Äôs a debate raging over whether or not this actually shows you all of the links Google knows about (I‚Äôm 99% convinced it‚Äôs only a sample), but it‚Äôs at least a representative sample.
To see all of your links, click on ‚ÄúMore‚Äù under ‚ÄúWho links to you the most‚Äù then ‚ÄúDownload this table.‚Äù This, again, seems to only download a sample of what Google knows about. You can also select ‚ÄúDownload latest links‚Äù which provides more recent links than the other option.
Unfortunately this doesn‚Äôt let us see much a to the value of the links, nor does it show us links that have dropped or where those links are from.
To use those there are a wide variety of tools: If you have a budget I‚Äôd go with ahrefs.com as they have the biggest index, followed by Moz‚Äôs Open Site Explorer (most of the data you can get with a free account, if not then it‚Äôs slightly cheaper than ahrefs), and finally SEMrush, which is free for most purposes we need. MajesticSEO uses a combination of ‚Äútrust flow‚Äù and ‚Äúcitation flow‚Äù which also works fairly well to give you an idea as to the overall health and number of links pointing to your site.
All of these use different internal metrics to determine the ‚Äúauthority‚Äù of a link, but using them to compare apples to apples can be beneficial.
HTML links look something like this:
<a href=‚Äùhttp://www.somesite.com‚Äù title=‚Äùkeyword‚Äù>Anchor text</a>
Where http://www.somesite.com is the place the link directs you to, the title is largely a remnant of time gone by, and the linked text ‚Äî think the words that are blue and you click on ‚Äî is called the ‚Äúanchor text.‚Äù
In addition to the amount of link juice a page has, the relevance of the anchor text matters.
Generally speaking you want to use your keyword as the anchor text for your internal linking whenever possible. External linking (from other sites) shouldn‚Äôt be very heavily optimized for anchor text. If 90% of your links all have the same anchor text Google can throw a red flag, assuming that you‚Äôre doing something fishy.
If you‚Äôre ever creating links (like we‚Äôll show you in the future) I only ever use something generic like the site name, ‚Äúhere‚Äù or the full URL.
Generally speaking you don‚Äôt want orphan pages (those that aren‚Äôt linked to by other pages), nor do you want an overly-messy link structure.
Some say the ideal link structure for a site is something like this:
That‚Äôs close, but it gets a couple things wrong. First, you‚Äôll never have a structure that organized, and second, in an ideal world every page would link to every other page on its same level. This can easily be done with a footer that feels like a sitemap or ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù pages. That allows you to specify anchor text, and pass link juice freely from page to page.
Unfortunately it‚Äôs impossible to draw such a web without it becoming a mess, so you‚Äôll just have to imagine what that actually looks like.
We have just one more thing to go over before we start getting those first links pointing to our site.
Most of SEO is managing stuff that can go wrong. There is a lot of that, but we‚Äôll go over what will cover 99% of needs, and you can Google if there‚Äôs something really crazy.
Robots.txt
Almost every site has a page at url.com/robots.txt ‚Äî even google has one.
This is just a plain text file that lets you tell search engine crawlers what to crawl and not to crawl. Most are pretty good about listening, except the Bingbot, which pretty much does whatever it wants no matter what you tell it. (I‚Äôm mostly kidding.)
If you don‚Äôt want Google to crawl a page (maybe it‚Äôs a login page you don‚Äôt want indexed, a landing page, etc.) you can just ‚Äúdisallow‚Äù it in your robots.txt by saying disallow: /somepage.
If you add a trailing / to it (e.g. disallow: /somepage/) it will also disallow all child pages.
Technically you can specify different rules for different bots (or user agents), but it‚Äôs easiest to start your file with ‚ÄúUser-agent: *‚Äù if you don‚Äôt have a need for separate crawling rules.
Disavow
Google will penalize spammy sites, and unfortunately this causes some bad behavior from bad actors. Say, for example, you wanted to take out a competitor. You could send a bunch of obviously spammy links to their site and get them penalized. This is called ‚Äúnegative SEO,‚Äù and is something that happens often in highly contested keywords. Google generally tries to pretend like it doesn‚Äôt happen.
In the case that this does happen, however, you can ‚ÄúDisavow‚Äù links in the Search Console, which is pretty much saying, ‚ÄúHey Google, don‚Äôt count this one.‚Äù I hope you‚Äôll never have to use it, but if you hire (or have hired) a bad SEO or are being attacked by a competitor, that is how you combat it.
Nofollow
A link can have a property called ‚Äúnofollow‚Äù such as this:
<a href=‚Äùhttp://www.somesite.com‚Äù title=‚Äùkeyword‚Äù rel=‚Äùnofollow‚Äù>Anchor text</a>.
If you want to link to somebody but you don‚Äôt want it to count as a vote (you don‚Äôt want to pass link-juice), or you support user-generated content and want to deter spammers, you can use a nofollow link. Google says it discounts the value of those links. I‚Äôm not convinced they discount them heavily, but other SEOs are so they seem to deter spammers if nothing else.
Redirects
If you‚Äôre going to change a URL, but you don‚Äôt want its link juice to disappear, you can use a 301 redirect. A 301 will pass a majority of the link juice.
Canonical URLs
If you have two pages that are virtually the same, you can add something like <link rel=‚Äùcanonical href=‚Äùhttps://www.someurl.com/somepage‚Äù> to say ‚Äúhey, treat this page as if it were that page instead, but I don‚Äôt want to 301 it.‚Äù
And with that, we‚Äôre ready to build our first links.
Link building is where SEO really starts to matter, and where a lot of people end up in a world of hurt.
The best way to build links is to not build links. I‚Äôve worked for companies in the past that don‚Äôt have to ask for them, they just flow in from press, customer blogs, their awesome blog posts, etc. If this is an option (and we‚Äôll go over a couple of ways to make it more likely) you‚Äôre in a great place.
If not, at least in the beginning, we‚Äôre going to manually create just a few.
We‚Äôre going to create them in legitimate ways and not hire somebody in India to do so. That is a recipe for disaster, and I can‚Äôt even count the number of times I‚Äôve seen that take down a site.
The easiest way to build high quality links are what SEOs call ‚Äúweb 2.0s.‚Äù That‚Äôs just a way to say ‚Äúsocial sites‚Äù or sites that let you post stuff. Now tweeting a link into the abyss won‚Äôt do you anything, but profiles, status pages, etc. do carry some weight. And if they come from a popular domain that counts as a link.
Some of the easiest are:
Twitter (in your bio)
Github (the readme of a repo)
YouTube (the description of a video ‚Äî it has to actually get views)
Wordpress (yes, you‚Äôll have to actually create a blog)
Blogger (same here)
Tumblr
Upvote-based sites (HackerNews, GrowthHackers, Inbound.org, etc.)
If nothing else you can start there and get a half dozen to a dozen links. There are always big lists of ‚Äúweb 2.0s‚Äù you can find online, but keep in mind if you‚Äôre going to build something out on a blogging platform you‚Äôre going to have to really build something out. That‚Äôs a lot of content and time, but you have to do it the right way.
We generally keep a bigger list of Web 2.0s here. Some may be out of date, but you should probably only build a half dozen to a dozen Web 2.0s anyway.
Another way to get link juice is by purchasing an expired domain. This is more difficult to do, but there are a lot of options such as expireddomains.net. (Google ‚Äúexpired domains‚Äù and you‚Äôll find dozens of sites monitoring them.)
You‚Äôll want to purchase a domain that has expired and restore it as closely as you can to its original form using an archive. These sites likely have some link juice to pass on and you can pass it to yourself.
Another way to find places you can build links is by using a link intersection tool. These find sites that link to ‚Äúcompetitor a‚Äù and ‚Äúcompetitor b‚Äù but not to you. Theoretically, if they link to both of your competitors, they should be willing to link to you. Moz, Ahrefs, LunaMetrics and others have link intersection tools that work quite well.
Now that we have a few basic links flowing, we‚Äôre going to work on some strategies that will send continual links and press, eventually getting to a point where we don‚Äôt have to build any more links.
Awesome ‚Äî you have a site that converts well, your SEO is in place, ready for you to drive traffic. Now what?
As you‚Äôre probably learned at this point, a site that converts very well but has no traffic flowing to it still converts zero traffic.
We‚Äôre going to fix that.
This section takes a lot of time and effort, and in the beginning you‚Äôll likely wonder if you‚Äôre doing anything at all. Remember that class in college that is so difficult it‚Äôs the point where most people give up, effectively weeding out the people who aren‚Äôt ready to major in a specific subject?
Well this is the weeder-out chapter of growth hacking.
The reason so many people stumble on this step is the same reason people stumble on so many steps that take a little effort under time ‚Äî losing weight, investing in a 401(k), etc. In the beginning you‚Äôre going to have a little seedling of traffic, and you‚Äôll be looking up to those who have giant oak trees, thinking, ‚ÄúI must be doing something wrong.‚Äù You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong. The traffic starts as a trickle before it becomes a flood.
But don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre a startup. Our goal is to get enough traffic that continuing to do this effort will be sustainable (meaning we won‚Äôt die before we start to see the rewards), but at the same time we‚Äôre building equity in the Internet.
The type of traffic we want to build is the type that will compound and will never go away. We want to create traffic today that will still give us a little trickle in five years. Combining hundreds (or thousands) of little trickles, our site that converts, and a great product we will create a giant river.
Future chapters will go into depth on the networks we need to drive traffic from, so in this chapter we‚Äôre going to focus on traffic that‚Äôs network-agnostic. Traffic that we can‚Äôt get by tapping any specific network.
Just to give you some idea of scale, I‚Äôve seen this process drive over 500,000 visits per day, though the build up to that level took almost a full year. What could you do with 500,000 visits per day?
To start we‚Äôre going to use the keywords we found in the SEO chapter, and inject ourselves (and our company) into the conversation wherever it‚Äôs taking place.
To do this we‚Äôre going to use software called BuzzBundle.
This software lets us do a few things:
This step takes thought, effort, and a real human who understands what they‚Äôre typing. I don‚Äôt often say this, but you cannot effectively automate this step without it becoming spammy. If you‚Äôre trying to replicate the automated SEO spam you‚Äôve seen on various blogs and sites this will probably work, but you‚Äôll get banned, your clickthrough will be a fraction of what it could be, and you‚Äôll be banned
We‚Äôre not going to fire up some awful software to drop spun mentions of garbage onto various comment sections online hoping that brings us SEO traffic. Our comments must do two things:
If you do these two things a few changes will take place: First, you‚Äôll notice that people click on your links because you‚Äôre a thoughtful person who likes to contribute. Second, people will respect your company because you‚Äôre a thoughtful person who likes to contribute.
And with that disclaimer, we‚Äôll move on to the nitty gritty of how this is done.
Now that all of that is out of the way, let‚Äôs fire up BuzzBundle and get to work.
The first thing you‚Äôll want to do in BuzzBundle is go to Accounts -> Add new accounts. This is the starting point for everything we‚Äôll do, as we need accounts to comment.
One thing you‚Äôll notice about BuzzBundle is that it lets you use multiple accounts. I find it beneficial to think from multiple perspectives and therefore multiple points of view, but I don‚Äôt want to go too far overboard and be spammy.
I‚Äôd recommend doing something simple ‚Äî create 2‚Äì3 personas, each of whom you identify with (or are you), and enter them into your BuzzBundle accounts.
Personally I don‚Äôt even change my name, I just use a different one (eg. Austen J. Allred vs. Austen Allred) or use a few photos, just so it isn‚Äôt literally the same name and same photo blanketing the Internet.
Disqus is a comment system used all over the place, and it carries some caveates. Disqus will ban you if you use the same link in every post, so there are two workarounds:
Both of these work, but the second one is much easier in my view.
Using links with our UTM parameters here will be very beneficial. We‚Äôll be able to track traffic back to each individual blog or site, and if necessary double down on the ones that are driving traffic.
If you ever start to run into problems with getting your link posted, it may be useful to use a few link shorteners or some 301 redirects.
To keep it simple you can use a link shortener that 301s such as bit.ly, or if you want to spend a little more time you can set up your own site and 301 the traffic from a certain page to your money site.
Let‚Äôs get started with the BuzzBundle.
First, it‚Äôs going to ask you for a keyword. We already have a keyword from the SEO section, but we may want to do something even a bit more generic. For this one I‚Äôm going to go with ‚Äúgrowth hacking.‚Äù
Simply hit ‚Äúgo‚Äù and let BuzzBundle get started.
It will load different content types into different columns, but generally we are going to be scrolling through until we find something that looks compelling and like we can actually contribute to.
The first thing I clicked on was this:
It‚Äôs a review of another book about growth hacking. All I had to do was comment, tag the author, ask him if he were willing to review our book, and offer to send him one for free. (If you‚Äôre reading this now it‚Äôs going to be pretty awkward).
My assumption is this person will find the conversation to be completely authentic, because it is. The fact that there‚Äôs now a link on his video that people who are searching for something else will find is just an added bonus.
As an aside, I much prefer to hold ‚Äúshift‚Äù and click on a link to open it in my normal browser if I‚Äôm just going to be commenting as myself.
The next one I found was a roundup of great growth hacking blog posts from the week.
I left the following comment:
Note how I followed him on Twitter so that it‚Äôs obviously personal and not an automated spam comment. I even went a little bit overboard and tweeted at him just for kicks.
That is how you get people on your team.
As you get further along and have an idea of how to get a good response, I‚Äôd recommend starting to sort by reach, ramping up the number of keywords you‚Äôre searching for, and possibly even gasp upgrading to the paid version of BuzzBundle.

Right? Why else go through all the pain and hardship? It‚Äôs to achieve happiness in some way.
And I‚Äôm not the only person who believed that. In fact, if you look around you, most people are pursuing happiness in their lives.
That‚Äôs why we collectively buy shit we don‚Äôt need, go to bed with people we don‚Äôt love, and try to work hard to get approval of people we don‚Äôt like.
Why do we do these things? To be honest, I don‚Äôt care what the exact reason is. I‚Äôm not a scientist. All I know is that it has something to do with history, culture, media, economy, psychology, politics, the information era, and you name it. The list is endless.
Let‚Äôs just accept that. Most people love to analyze why people are not happy or don‚Äôt live fulfilling lives. I don‚Äôt necessarily care about the why.
I care more about how we can change.
Just a few short years ago, I did everything to chase happiness.
But at the end of the day, you‚Äôre lying in your bed (alone or next to your spouse), and you think: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next in this endless pursuit of happiness?‚Äù
Well, I can tell you what‚Äôs next: You, chasing something random that you believe makes you happy.
It‚Äôs all a facÃßade. A hoax. A story that‚Äôs been made up.
Did Aristotle lie to us when he said:
I think we have to look at that quote from a different angle. Because when you read it, you think that happiness is the main goal. And that‚Äôs kind of what the quote says as well.
Happiness can‚Äôt be a goal in itself. Therefore, it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs achievable.
I believe that happiness is merely a byproduct of usefulness.
When I talk about this concept with friends, family, and colleagues, I always find it difficult to put this into words. But I‚Äôll give it a try here.
Most things we do in life are just activities and experiences.
Those things should make you happy, right? But they are not useful. You‚Äôre not creating anything. You‚Äôre just consuming or doing something. And that‚Äôs great.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I love to go on holiday, or go shopping sometimes. But to be honest, it‚Äôs not what gives meaning to life.
What really makes me happy is when I‚Äôm useful. When I create something that others can use. Or even when I create something I can use.
For the longest time I found it difficult to explain the concept of usefulness and happiness. But when I recently ran into a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, the dots finally connected.
Emerson says:
And I didn‚Äôt get that before I became more conscious of what I‚Äôm doing with my life. And that always sounds heavy and all. But it‚Äôs actually really simple.
Did you do useful things in your lifetime? You don‚Äôt have to change the world or anything. Just make it a little bit better than before you were born.
If you don‚Äôt know how, here are some ideas.
That‚Äôs just some stuff I like to do. You can make up your own useful activities.
You see? It‚Äôs not anything big. But when you do little useful things every day, it adds up to a life that is well lived. A life that mattered.
The last thing I want is to be on my deathbed and realize there‚Äôs zero evidence that I ever existed.
Recently I read Not Fade Away by Laurence Shames and Peter Barton. It‚Äôs about Peter Barton, the founder of Liberty Media, who shares his thoughts about dying from cancer.
It‚Äôs a very powerful book and it will definitely bring tears to your eyes. In the book, he writes about how he lived his life and how he found his calling. He also went to business school, and this is what he thought of his fellow MBA candidates:
You can say that about all of us. And after he realized that in his thirties, he founded a company that turned him into a multi-millionaire.
Another person who always makes himself useful is Casey Neistat. I‚Äôve been following him for a year and a half now, and every time I watch his YouTube show, he‚Äôs doing something.
He also talks about how he always wants to do and create something. He even has a tattoo on his forearm that says ‚ÄúDo More.‚Äù
Most people would say, ‚Äúwhy would you work more?‚Äù And then they turn on Netflix and watch back to back episodes of Daredevil.
Being useful is a mindset. And like with any mindset, it starts with a decision. One day I woke up and thought to myself: What am I doing for this world? The answer was nothing.
And that same day I started writing. For you it can be painting, creating a product, helping elderly, or anything you feel like doing.
Don‚Äôt take it too seriously. Don‚Äôt overthink it. Just DO something that‚Äôs useful. Anything.

Donny Reynolds|7.4K|9|https://medium.com/fwd-thoughts/the-future-is-without-apps-ddf43ec52aab?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|The Future is Without Apps ‚Äì Fwd: Thoughts ‚Äì Medium|"‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an App for That.‚Äù
It‚Äôs the trademarked slogan that defined the mobile world since 2008. Surely, apps seemed to be the way to go. Coding bootcamps that claimed to teach you app development chops within weeks popped up everywhere; products used commercials to go out of their way and show off their new apps; heck, even that family restaurant around the block got its own menu app built.
With the release of the App store in 2008, Apple was the first to popularize the idea of nicely packaged, downloadable applications on your phone. However, this concept of centralized software distribution isn‚Äôt actually new. Many handheld and desktop devices already had some form of application store built in years before Apple‚Äôs App Store debut. The reason why Apple succeeded, in retrospect, is a combination of timing and technology. By 2008, the iOS (then ‚ÄúiPhone OS‚Äù) platform was able to offer access to a maturing 3G network, a well-documented development environment, great handheld graphics, and most importantly, the backing of a technology giant. Mobile apps made sense. They were the most efficient way to deliver the newest content and services with native experience and performance.
People don‚Äôt care how it all works, they just want to throw birds at pigs and show off their #nofilter selfies. The ability to download and run cool apps was the iPhone‚Äôs winning feature for a short while. Android soon followed suit. Smartphones became cheaper; networks became faster; handheld processing power quadrupled; apps prevailed.
Nothing. But we can do better now. ‚ÄúBetter than this app that lets me feed and play with cute cats?‚Äù Yep.
You see, mobile apps succeeded because of the right combination of fast network and capable handheld processors. Technologies have progressed much further than that in the meantime, and the world of apps has grown beyond a healthy size. Among all of the headaches that follow the impenetrable mobile market today, the two most urgent would be the delivery and discoverability of content.
Everyone with a smartphone has experienced this at some point: ‚ÄúWow, this restaurant/shop is offering 20% off the special entree...oh, but only if you have this app,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWait, I have to download an app for this? I just to want to see what my friend posted.‚Äù You probably heard from a friend or saw in a billboard about this really cool app that‚Äôll transform your life, but hesitated to install it, or worse, pay for it.
The problem is twofold. Let‚Äôs start with the first: delivery. Your average digital couch potato now has a shorter attention span and less patience. Paying for and installing an app, what was once a magical, fast, and smooth experience, is an act of commitment for many nowadays. You won‚Äôt believe how many people demand a convincing reason, your heartfelt speech, and your first-born child just to get them to try out a new app. Just think about that one friend who still refuses to download the Messenger app (seriously just get it already). Companies want to deliver content and services to customers as fast and easily as possible, but the increasing reluctance for the perceived installation-barrier is putting up a delivery obstacle. Our home screens are the new San Francisco ‚Äî space is at a premium.
The second problem, discoverability, is a little bit more subtle, but was well articulated by a few tech journalists in the past. Many popular apps, such as Instagram and The Daily, began as mobile-only apps that surfaced great content only within a closed platform. You had to download and register for Instagram in order to see your friends‚Äô Instagram photos. I‚Äôm sure that there are many more apps out there today that I‚Äôm not aware of with useful content that are not searchable or viewable on your browser. A fragmented Internet where creative and original content are locked up in proprietary platforms is not the Internet we know and love.
Now that we understand the problems, let‚Äôs take a look at the current solutions. The word ‚Äúapp linking‚Äù may not sound familiar to you, but every time you tap on a YouTube link in another app and the YouTube app opens up to play the video, you‚Äôre experiencing it. Google, Apple, and Facebook have all implemented variations of this technology. App linking brings you to the app that best presents the content you want. Great.
The other half of our existing solution to compliment app linking is app indexing. Google and Apple have provided ways for third-party content providers to show their own in-app content in a search query, allowing previously locked away content to surface on Google and iOS Spotlight.
Perfect. That seems to have solved our delivery and discoverability problems. User searches for something, in-app content shows up in the results, user clicks the link and gets brought into the app.
You might have already noticed the problems here. What if the app doesn‚Äôt support app linking and indexing? App indexing requires the content provider to actively put effort into implementing it, so by default, your content is not visible to the world wide web, exactly opposite of how most web-based content work. And only until recently, in order for your app to be indexed by Google, developers had to build mirroring web versions. Just imagine the troubles. On the consumer side, what if I don‚Äôt have that app to begin with? What if I don‚Äôt want to install that app just to read an article? The list goes on.
Think about that one time when you tried to check out something and it redirected you into App Store instead. Very annoying. And no, no one wants to install your app.
I don‚Äôt want to maintain a walled garden of apps. I want to consume and create content.
‚ÄúSo then, what is the solution?‚Äù
Just get rid of ‚Äúapps.‚Äù Let‚Äôs see how we might be able to do this.
Google‚Äôs approach to the delivery and discoverability problem has relied on app indexing and linking. If the developer puts in the effort, users can see previously mobile-only content surfacing on Google search results. This is great for Google to stay relevant in a mobile market that is increasingly reliant on native app content instead of web search. But in countries like China and India, where mobile phones are the first computers for millions of people and mobile-only content is king, where does a search engine provide their links to begin with? Suddenly, ‚Äúeverything is just a Google search away‚Äù loses its magic.
Roughly four months ago, Google rolled out an impressive technology that almost no one remembers ‚Äî App Streaming. It does exactly what it sounds like; instead of installing applications like we‚Äôre used to, you tap a link to the content and Google will stream the right parts of the app to you on-demand. No need to install it, ‚Äôcause you‚Äôre already running it. It might be Google‚Äôs first pilot experiment of their cloud platform, but the idea of streaming applications onto your phone is not new. In fact, the very technology itself was bought by Google from Agawi a few years back.
Combine App Streaming and App Indexing, suddenly you remove the two barriers to all information previously locked away in mobile apps.
While Google‚Äôs fantastic solution is still in an experimental stage, Apple is nudging its developers in more or less the same direction, albeit characteristic of Apple, in a less obvious or more incremental way.
On-Demand Resources (ODR) is a technology released with iOS 9 that downloads a small core application only on installation, and then downloads extra parts and content as needed. ODR currently is being used mostly in games, where a user only downloads the assets (graphics, videos, etc.) for a few beginning levels. iOS will then download more levels as the user progresses, and delete assets for completed levels to make space.
How does this mirror Google‚Äôs approach? It doesn‚Äôt. However, if ODR becomes commonplace and the supporting infrastructure is flexible enough, you can reasonably imagine Apple extending the framework to a more general use case. In any case, they got this wonderful tool under the belt that will potentially blossom into a form of install-free applications.
While we‚Äôre on Apple, I want to bring up Steve Jobs‚Äôs vision of the first iPhone. You might still remember fondly that the first iPhone was a closed platform with no developer environment or third-party apps. His solution? Web apps.
Web apps don‚Äôt need to be installed. They run (relatively) securely in closed browser environment. They are web friendly, meaning they can be indexed and surfaced by search engines. Oh wait, isn‚Äôt that exactly what we want today? Probably.
I‚Äôm still leaning on the belief that web apps were simply Steve Jobs‚Äôs transitional plan to native apps, but even so, I think he was (at least accidentally) onto something. If we had in 2008 the powerful Javascript frameworks we have today, perhaps web apps would have taken off. Feel free to paint the story into one where Jobs the Visionary foresaw the discoverability and delivery problem, because perhaps he did predict this.
A lot of what app streaming offers competes with other sophisticated web app technologies (React Native, etc.) that are quickly closing the gap between native and web. However, one decisive differentiating factor would still be the native look and feel or possibly performance that web apps sorely lack. There is just no perfect solution yet.
On top of it all, what we really need is a platform-agnostic solution to app streaming that truly overcomes content delivery and discoverability problems. We want something akin to Java applets on browsers (yikes) on mobile. Imagine the possibilities: regardless of the OS or the brand of supercomputer you have in your pocket, you will be able to run an app and view its content with zero friction and with native feel and performance. As for developers, you can write an app once and stream it to all devices and browsers.
With Google streaming apps to your phone and Apple nudging developers to store parts of their apps in the cloud, we may have just entered the beginning of a future where installation becomes obsolete and the border between ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù and ‚Äúnative app‚Äù is blurred. This is a future without apps. And it‚Äôs wonderful.
The user forefront of all these insanely complex, powerful, and cool technologies is one of ultimate simplicity and elegance.

No funding. No connections. No customers. No ‚Äî you‚Äôre not nuts.
But First, a Digression...
Are you like me and completely sick of all the patronizing startup advice out there? You know, the kind that goes like this:
Let me give you permission to join me in calling bullshit. It just doesn‚Äôt work that way. And anyone that would lead you to believe otherwise is only trying to make themselves seem smarter and more clever than you ‚Äî so that you‚Äôll keep listening to them for their next nugget of advice.
The stone cold truth of the matter is that most of the people pandering this advice are only doing so to build up their ‚Äúguru‚Äù status.
When they claim they got 100,000 email signups in a week (and make it look as easy as microwaving popcorn) ‚Äî they‚Äôre playing you. They‚Äôre creating an idealized result that you will never attain. At the same time, they‚Äôre implying that you should be able to get similar results ‚Äî but only if you know what they know. They do this so that look up to them. They do this so that you talk about them (getting you to help them grow their audience). They do this so that you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre somehow less than they are. And they do this to make you feel like you can only be successful with their continued ‚Äúhelp‚Äù (or exclusive online webinar with limited seats starting at $1,000 where they spill all their ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù).
I promise I‚Äôm not going to do any of that to you.
What follows is straightforward, battle tested, and pragmatic advice to help you get your SaaS startup off the ground all by your lonesome ‚Äî just like I did when bootstrapping Tamboo (a service that lets you record and watch what people do on your website), as well as a handful of other SaaS apps.
Some of it may seem simple. Don‚Äôt be fooled. There is complexity in simple things. The more you experience it, the more you‚Äôll see what I mean by that.
Let‚Äôs get to it.
A Quick Update
Since its original publication, The Epic Guide has become an *insanely* popular resource for bootstrapped startups ‚Äî on the verge of becoming a ‚Äúcult classic‚Äù!
I‚Äôve had an insane number of people asking me for even more down and to the point advice for building their startups ‚Äî so much so that it‚Äôs inspired me to give The Epic Guide the full-length book treatment.
If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about the book or if you‚Äôre itching to pick up a copy, head on over to this page I‚Äôve set up for The Epic Guide to Bootstrapping a Startup By Yourself: The Book!
Now back to our regularly scheduled programming:
If You Love Writing Code, You‚Äôre Going to Hate Running a SaaS Business
Since most people wanting to start a SaaS business are developers, we need to get this out of the way ‚Äî and fast.
Building and running a SaaS business has nothing to do with your ability to write code.
Too many developers have the following thought process:
Yeah, that would be great. Except it doesn‚Äôt work that way. Unless you relish doing failed startup postmortems.
This might be going a little too far, but at the same time it‚Äôs probably not going far enough: Code is the least important thing about a SaaS business.
In fact, most startup codebases are dismal abysses of darkness, pain, and the cause for much wailing and gnashing of teeth. They are the furthest thing from the pristine green fields you imagine them to be.
The reason for this is simple: A business‚Äôs software serves one purpose and one purpose only: To make the business money.
You want comprehensive unit tests for your entire codebase? How does that make the business money?
You want to use DI and IoC? How does that make the business money?
You want to use that shiny new framework? How does that make the business money?
Contrast that with the following:
This customer is requesting this feature. How fast can we build that so we can get them to buy?
We think making this change will get more signups. How fast can we make that happen?
This thing is completely broken right now and we have customers cancelling! How fast can we get a fix in?
If you try to build your SaaS app like you build enterprise software, you will most likely fail. Not because your software isn‚Äôt good enough (in fact, I‚Äôll bet you it would be downright awesome). But because you took too long working on things that don‚Äôt contribute to the business making money. And so you just simply run out of time and/or money. Game over.
Now don‚Äôt misread me here. We‚Äôre talking about code, not your product. Your product still has to be good. It still needs to be solid. It still needs to do what your customers expect it to do. Customers care about your product. You‚Äôre the only one who cares about your code.
The other thing you need to be aware of is that you‚Äôre going to spend very little time actually writing code running a SaaS business.
How little?
There‚Äôs times that I don‚Äôt write a line of code for months on end.
Instead of coding, the vast majority of your time is going to be spent marketing, selling, optimizing funnels, and providing support. Those are the things that get (and keep) customers. Those are the things that you do when you run a business. Not writing code.
Getting Your Idea Off The Ground
Now that we‚Äôve gotten all of that out of the way, let‚Äôs get to the good stuff: How to actually build a SaaS business from nothing.
First off, you should know that your idea probably sucks.
Dude, what‚Äôs with all of this negativity? Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you that I don‚Äôt kid glove when it comes to this stuff. If you want to feel good about yourself, go listen to one of the startup gurus out there that will be more than happy to spoon feed you some entreporn. We‚Äôre busy building a business here.
Now, back to your idea.
The reason your idea probably sucks is because it‚Äôs your idea.
Meaning: Your idea is only worth something if other people care about it. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you think. Chances are you‚Äôre not Elon Musk (hello if you are!). We‚Äôre building a business, not our ego.
So really, your SaaS business idea is just a guess.
You‚Äôre guessing that this is something that people are interested in. You‚Äôre guessing that this is something people would want to use. You‚Äôre guessing that this is something that people will give you money for. You‚Äôre guessing that this is something that can scale into an actual business that can replace your income.
So Elon ‚Äî going forward, we‚Äôre not going to refer to your precious game-changing idea as ‚Äúyour idea‚Äù anymore. We‚Äôre going to refer to it as ‚Äúyour guess‚Äù.
This will help you disassociate your emotions from the process. And believe me, you‚Äôre going to need to do just that.
Finding the Right Words
If you‚Äôve heard about value propositions, USPs, elevator pitches, etc. and think you can just skip this section ‚Äî you‚Äôre doing so at your own peril. Getting your messaging right is perhaps one of the most important things you need to nail. Pretty much everything down stream depends on this. And don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll just do this once and be done. You‚Äôll probably get it wrong the first few times. Plus you‚Äôll need to continually come back to this as you try to grow your market.
Now that we have our hunch or guess (not idea!), we need to answer three important questions:
We need to do this for two reasons.
First, we need to sanity check our guess to make sure that it‚Äôs actually valuable to people and that we‚Äôre thinking in terms of what it enables people to do. Your guess shouldn‚Äôt be about software. Your guess should be about the types of superpowers or beneficial outcomes people will get as a result of using your service.
Second, we need a way to quickly explain our guess to people to see how they react to it.
It‚Äôs simple (but infuriatingly difficult).
Let‚Äôs play fill in the blank:
For example:
I believe that people want to send automated drip email campaigns to their email list signups so that they can automatically nurture leads and convert them into paying customers, and they would pay good money for that because trying to convert leads by manually sending emails or by using something like MailChimp is hard and takes forever.
Perfect. This becomes our business hypothesis.
Now we need to rearrange the jigsaw pieces a little bit for when we put the message in front of people. One more time:
If you have been trying to convert leads by manually sending emails or by using something like MailChimp and think it‚Äôs hard and takes forever, you can send automated drip email campaigns to your email list signups with MailZoo so that you can automatically nurture leads and convert them into paying customers.
Awesome.
Now ‚Äî are your messages compelling?
You did do this, right?
Need more prodding? When I first started out building online businesses, I didn‚Äôt do this exercise and would just jump in and start coding. Most of those projects would wind up failing miserably. When I started doing this exercise (and got it right), my projects stopped failing.
Now. Are your business hypothesis and customer-facing message believable? Do you really think people would give you good money for the ability you‚Äôre giving them? Is the outcome you came up with plausible and something that people actually want to achieve? If not, go back to the drawing board until it sings. This can take minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even months to get right. And if you can never get it right, chances are your guess was wrong and you‚Äôll need to come up with a new one.
There are no sacred cows when it comes to building a business. I don‚Äôt care how much you love your ‚Äúidea‚Äù. If it doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúbuy me!‚Äù when you put it into this format, slaughter it and start over with something new.
Let‚Äôs Make Some Friends
Now, let‚Äôs take the underlying reason that people would pay money for our service from the exercise above. Just for reference, our example is that people would be willing to pay good money for our solution because converting leads by manually sending emails or by using something like MailChimp is hard and takes forever.
Our job now is to find people that meet this criteria. In our example, we‚Äôre looking for people that have been trying to convert leads by manually sending emails or by using something like MailChimp and think it‚Äôs hard and takes forever. (See why I told you that was important?)
We need to test some very important things here that will make or break our business:
So now it‚Äôs time to hurt our heads a little bit.
Go and brainstorm 20 different and specific places you can find the kinds of people that would want to give you money for the value statement you‚Äôre offering. These need to be super specific. You can‚Äôt say something like ‚Äúpeople who participate in online forums where they talk about email marketing‚Äù. No. You need to name those forums. And they can only count as one way out of the 20 we‚Äôre talking about here.
You‚Äôll ultimately need to figure this out for yourself, but here‚Äôs some ideas based on our ongoing example: People following MailChimp on Twitter, people who hang out on inbound.org, people that have blogs with a newsletter signup box, people listening to the Smart Passive Income podcast, people who have retweeted any of Ramit Sethi‚Äôs articles, people who like HubSpot on Facebook, etc.
You‚Äôll probably find that this is harder than it seems. That‚Äôs okay. It is.
As a side note: If you can‚Äôt come up with 20 good places, chance are you don‚Äôt know who your customer actually is. Believe me, it‚Äôs better you find this out now rather than after you‚Äôve spent 5‚Äì6 months heads down around the clock coding your app. Either educate yourself or pick a customer you understand better.
Alright, it‚Äôs about time we put ourselves out there. Like I said before, all you have right now is a guess ‚Äî not an idea. You‚Äôre guessing that some solution you‚Äôve concocted in your head is actually going to be useful to people. So we‚Äôre going to find out if people care about what you have to say.
But here‚Äôs the kicker ‚Äî we‚Äôre not going to tell them anything about our solution. Nothing. Nada. Zilch.
Instead, we‚Äôre going to see if they care about the reason we think they‚Äôd want to give us money. You‚Äôll see why in a few.
So now, we‚Äôre going to research 10 individual people from each of the 20 places we identified. Yes. If you‚Äôre good at math, you just realized that we‚Äôre going to be going after 200 people. I kid you not. You‚Äôll also see why in a few.
Let‚Äôs take our running example. Let‚Äôs say we think that people that have blogs with a newsletter signup box would care about what we‚Äôre talking about. Great. Let‚Äôs go find 10 blogs that we think would give us money based on the premise that we identified. Find out how you can get in touch with the person running the blog. Ideally, you want an email address. You can settle for a contact form. But don‚Äôt just leave some comment spam and walk away thinking you did your job.
Now, let‚Äôs send them a personalized message like the following:
The text in bold is just my emphasis to call out where we‚Äôre slipping in the part we think they would care enough about to pay money for ‚Äî don‚Äôt bold your own text like that.
Also: Never say you like something if you don‚Äôt, express interest in something you could care less about, or mislead them in any way. It will come back to bite you. Tenfold.
If you do everything right, you should probably get a handful of responses from the 200 people you sent detailed, thoughtful, well researched messages to. Yep, you read that right. A handful of responses for 200 messages.
If you work in a corporate environment, this will probably mess with you. Think about it. You‚Äôre used responding to emails you receive, and you‚Äôre used to getting responses from people you‚Äôve sent emails to. It‚Äôs common office courtesy. If you don‚Äôt respond to an email, you‚Äôre ostrisized. The internet doesn‚Äôt work that way. Indifference is the rule. We‚Äôll talk more about how to handle rejection later on.
Because of this, you may be tempted to just blast people with a template. Don‚Äôt. People will see right through it. Plus that‚Äôs just spammy and wrong.
Okay, so let‚Äôs say we get some responses. You‚Äôd honestly be surprised by how much information you can get from people when you just ask them about what they‚Äôre doing. Maybe they read like this:
I had a dog and BINGO was his name-o.
If you don‚Äôt get any responses, or if you don‚Äôt get any responses that reinforce your hypothesis, you have a couple of options:
For those of you still playing along at home, we‚Äôre not done ‚Äî nowhere near close. But if you are getting responses like this, you‚Äôve gotten some confirmation that the underlying reason people would give you money does exist. Now it‚Äôs time to find out if they think your solution is worth any salt.
Time To See If Our Solution Sticks
Now it‚Äôs time to see what happens when we actually put our idea out in front of those people who responded in a way that confirms our money-generating hypothesis.
Something as simple as this would suffice (bold is my own ‚Äî don‚Äôt bold your stuff):
You can see that here, we use the ability and outcome from our earlier messaging exercise. (See why I told you to do that?)
Now, one of the following is going to probably happen:
Chances are, you‚Äôre going to get responses #1‚Äì3 far more often than #4.
So what do you do?
If you don‚Äôt get a response, you should follow up until you do or they tell you to bugger off.
If their response is ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not a problem‚Äù, ask them under what circumstances it would become a problem or make sense for them to try what you‚Äôre offering. If you get enough of these types of responses, it may be that you‚Äôre close, and that you just need to target people that have the problem they refer to or are in the circumstances they describe.
If their response is ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a bunch of companies already doing that‚Äù, don‚Äôt scrap your idea! Just because someone else is already doing what you thought was a revolutionary concept doesn‚Äôt mean you should give up. In fact, it helps to prove that there might already be a market out there for you. In this case, you should ask them what they mean by ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù and what they would like to see in the market as an alternative to the companies they mentioned. See if adjusting your offering in light of these insights will get you to ‚ÄúHeck yes‚Äù.
If they‚Äôve said ‚ÄúHeck yes‚Äù, you‚Äôre nailing it.
After you get those ‚ÄúHeck yeses‚Äù, tell them that you‚Äôre going to look into what you can do for them and ask them if they‚Äôd be interested to look at what you come up with.
The goal here is to get to 20 ‚ÄúHeck yeses‚Äù that are interested in hearing about what you come up with. You‚Äôll need to refine your message, listen to feedback, adjust your message again, try different approaches, different places, different people, etc.
Make no mistake, it‚Äôll most likely suck.
If you can‚Äôt get to 20, you might want to reconsider what you‚Äôre doing.

SteÃÅphane Nasser|2K|9|https://medium.com/parisoma-blog/valuation-for-startups-9-methods-explained-53771c86590e?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|Valuation For Startups ‚Äî 9 Methods Explained ‚Äì The PARISOMA Review ‚Äì Medium|"This article was co-written and published in French by Augustin de Cambourg, in Portuguese by Raphael Mielle, and in Spanish by Alberto Martinez de Arenaza.
A startup is like a box. A very special box.
The box has a value. The more things you put in the box, the more its value increases. Add a patent in the box, the value increases. Add a kick-ass management team in the box, the value increases. Easy, right?
The box is also magic. When you put $1 inside, it will return you $2, $3 or even $10! Amazing!
Problem is, building a box can be very expensive. So you need to go and see people with money ‚Äî let‚Äôs call them investors ‚Äî and offer them a deal that sounds a bit like this:
But how much should ‚ÄúX‚Äù be?
It depends on the Pre-Money Valuation, e.g. the value of the box at the moment of the investment. But calculating the Pre-Money Valuation is tricky. This article will take you through 9 different valuation methods to better let you understand how to determine Pre-Money Valuation.
The Berkus Method is a simple and convenient rule of thumb to estimate the value of your box. It was designed by Dave Berkus, a renowned author and business angel investor. The starting point is: do you believe that the box can reach $20M in revenue by the fifth year of business? If the answer is yes, then you can assess your box against the 5 key criteria for building boxes.
This will give you a rough idea of how much your box is worth (AKA pre-money valuation) and more importantly, what you should improve. Note that according to Berkus, the pre-money valuation should not be more than $2M.
The Berkus Method is meant for pre-revenue startups. To read more about the Berkus Method, click here.
The Risk Factor Summation Method or RFS Method is a slightly more evolved version of the Berkus Method. First, you determine an initial value for your box. Then you adjust said value for 12 risk factors inherent to box-building.
Initial value is determined as the average value for a similar box in your area, and risk factors are modelled as multiples of $250k, ranging from $500k for a very low risk, to -$500k for a very high risk. The most difficult part here, and in most valuation methods, is actualy finding data about similar boxes.
The Risk Factor Summation Method is meant for pre-revenue startups. To read more about the Risk Factor Summation Method, click here.
The Scorecard Valuation Method is a more elaborate approach to the box valuation problem. It starts the same way as the RFS method i.e. you determine a base valuation for your box, then you adjust the value for a certain set of criteria. Nothing new, except that those criteria are themselves weighed up based on their impact on the overall success of the project.
This method can also be found under the name of Bill Payne Method, considering 6 criteria: Management (30%), Size of opportunity (25%), Product or Service (10%), Sales channels (10%), Stage of business (10%) and Other factors (15%).
The Scorecard Valuation Method is meant for pre-revenue startups. To read more about the Scorecard Valuation Method, click here.
The Comparable Transactions Method is really just a rule of three.
Depending on the type of box you are building, you want to find an indicator which will be a good proxy for the value of your box. This indicator can be specific to your industry: Monthly Recurring Revenue (Saas), HR headcount (Interim), Number of outlets (Retail), Patent filed (Medtech/Biotech), Weekly Active Users or WAU (Messengers). Most of the time, you can just take lines from the P&L : sales, gross margin, EBITDA, etc.
The Comparables Transactions Method is meant for pre- and post-revenue startups. To read more about the Comparable Transactions Method, click here.
Forget about how magical the box is, and see how much 1 pound of cardboard is worth.
The book value refers to the net worth of the company i.e. the tangible assets of the box i.e. the ‚Äúhard parts‚Äù of the box.
The Book Value Method is particularly irrelevant for startups as it is focused on the ‚Äútangible‚Äù value of the company, while most startups focus on intangible assets : RD (for a biotech), user base and software development (for a Web startup), etc. To read more about the Book Value method, click here.
Rarely good from a seller perspective, the liquidation value is, as implied by its name, the valuation you apply to a company when it is going out of business.
Things that counts for a liquidation value estimation are all the tangible assets: Real Estate, Equipment, Inventory... Everything you can find a buyer for in a short span of time. The mindset is: if I sell whatever the company can in less than two months, how much money does that make ? All the intangibles on the other hand are considered worthless in a liquidation process (the underlying assumption is that if it was worth something, it would have already been sold at the time you enter in liquidation): patents, copyright, and any other intellectual property.
Practically, the liquidation value is the sum of the scrap value of all the tangible assets of the company.
For an investor, the liquidation value is useful as a parameter to evaluate the risk of the investment: a higher potential liquidation value means a lower risk. For example, all other things equal, it is preferable to invest in a company that owns its equipment compared to one that leases it. If everything goes wrong and you go out of business, at least you can get some money selling the equipment, whereas nothing if you lease it.
So, what is the difference between book value and liquidation value ? If a startup really had to sell its assets in the case of a bankruptcy, the value it would get from the sale would likely be below its book value, due to the adverse conditions of the sales.
So liquidation value < book value. Although they both account for tangible assets, the context in which those assets are valued differs. As Ben Graham points out, the liquidation value measures what the stockholders could get out of the business, while the book value measures what they have put into the business.
If your box works well, it brings in a certain amount of cash every year. Consequently, you could say that the current value of the box is the sum of all the future cash flows over the next years. And that is exactly the reasoning behind the DCF method.
Let‚Äôs say you are projecting cash flows over n years. What happens after that ? This is the question addressed by the Terminal Value (TV)
Option 1: you consider the business will keep growing at a steady pace, and keep generating indefinite cash flows after the n years period. You can then apply the formula for Terminal Value : : TV = CFn+1/(r- g) with ‚Äúr‚Äù being the discount rate and ‚Äúg‚Äù being the expected growth rate.
Option 2 : you consider an exit after the n year period. First, you want to estimate the future value of the acquisition, for example with the comparable method transaction (see above). Then, you have to discount this future value to get its net present value. TV = exit value/(1+r)^n
Although technically, you could use it for post-revenue startups, it is just not meant for startup valuation. To read more about the DCF method, click here.
The First Chicago Method answers to a specific situation: what if your box has a small chance of becoming huge? How to assess this potential?
The First Chicago Method (named after the late First Chicago Bank ‚Äî if you ask) deals with this issue by making three valuations: a worst case scenario (tiny box), a normal case scenario (normal box), a best case scenario (big box).
Each valuation is made with the DCF Method (or, if not possible, with internal rate of return formula or with multiples). You then decide of a percentage reflecting the probability of each scenario to happen. Your valuation according to the First Chicago Method is the weigthed average of each case.
The First Chicago Method is meant for post-revenue startups. You can read more about the First Chicago Method here.
As its name indicate, the Venture Capital Method stands from the viewpoint of the investor.
An investor is always looking for a specific return on investment, let‚Äôs say 20x. Besides, according to industry standards, the investor thinks that your box could be sold for $100M in 8 years. Based on those two elements, the investor can easily determine the maximum price he or she is willing to pay for investing in your box, after adjusting for dilution.
The Venture Capital Method is meant for pre- and post-revenue startups. To read more about the Venture Capital Method, click here.
Congratulations! If you made it this far, you know 9 valuation methods. So you must be screaming from the inside: what is the best valuation method ?!
First, keep in mind that the only methods really used by VCs are comparables and a rough estimate of how much dilution is acceptable by the founders ‚Äî e.g. giving out 15% to 25% for a seed round comprised between ‚Ç¨300k and ‚Ç¨500k, or making sure that the founders remain majority shareholders after a Series A.
Second, let us remember that valuations are nothing but formalized guesstimates. Valuations never show the true value of your company. They just show two things: (1) how bad the market is willing to invest in your little red box, and (2) how bad you are willing to accept it.
Having said that, I find that the best valuation method is the one described by Pierre Entremont, early-stage investor at Otium Capital, in this excellent article. According to him, you should start from defining your needs and then negotiate dilution:
Valuations are a good starting point when considering fundraising. They help builing up the reasoning behind the figures and objectify the discussion. But in the end, they are just the theoretical introduction to a more significant game of supply and demand.

Now on to the original article.
by Michael Horton | VP Product and UX/UI Designer at PhoneWagon
We have been living in a world of ‚Äòclean and minimal‚Äô for quite some time, so what‚Äôs next?
Over the last several months, some of the leaders of innovative design have taken ‚Äòminimal design‚Äô to the next level. Facebook, Airbnb and Apple have followed a similar blueprint to simplify prominent products in a way that reflects this new trend of ‚ÄòComplexion Reduction‚Äô in mobile design.
You‚Äôve never heard of ‚ÄòComplexion Reduction‚Äô you say? Well yea, that‚Äôs because I just made the term up. Recently I‚Äôve noticed a new trend that is beyond flat design, beyond minimal design and independent of progressive reduction. Some may claim that this is just the next step of minimal design being implemented into the mobile realm but I say it is something more distinct. There are specific similarities and characteristics that define this new trend. So I decided to name it. I‚Äôm allowed to do that, right?
The defining characteristics of this hot new trend sweeping across Silicon Valley are:
The result? The user interfaces of some of our favorite apps are starting to look more and more like they could all be housed under the same brand.
I first started taking notice of this trend back in early May when Instagram released their redesigned UI.
Some of the changes they introduced included removing much of the blue and dark grey color used throughout the app, making headlines bolder and simplifying the bottom navigation and icons. What was left was a black and white UI with bold headlines where the content shined and functionality was clear. I appreciated the less cluttered interface and was reminded a bit of a platform I have been an admirer of for quite some time; Medium. Medium has been rocking the black and white since launch in 2012, and has reduced clutter with each redesign since; effectively making Medium one of the originators of CR (Complexion Reduction) without even knowing it. Congratulations, Medium!
Shortly after the folks over at FB unveiled Instagram‚Äôs look, I opened up the Airbnb app and was struck by how familiar it looked. This was my first time browsing the app since they released a redesign in April, yet I felt like I had seen this all before.
Airbnb‚Äôs redesigned UI didn‚Äôt get nearly the media coverage of Instagram‚Äôs redesign a month later (partly because it wasn‚Äôt accompanied by a shiny new app icon) but it followed many of the same CR tactics.
The mobile redesign introduced larger, bolder headlines, removed unnecessary imagery and color and simplified their icons to make them more universally recognizable. What was left was a very black and white UI where the content shined and functionality was clear.
Apple is the latest example of designers becoming enamored by the Complexion Reduction movement. Earlier this month, at Apple‚Äôs WWDC the tech giant announced a number of exciting things for consumers to look forward to, including the release of iOS 10, which they are dubbing, ‚ÄúThe biggest iOS release ever!‚Äù (or at least since iOS 8 which was referred to as... ‚ÄúThe biggest iOS release ever!‚Äù)
One announcement in particular caught my eye. That was the redesign of Apple Music. While the most important aspects of the redesign are UX updates and additional features, the aesthetic was the first thing I noticed. Caitlin McGarry, a staff writer at Macworld, described the updated appearance well, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a totally new look, with giant cards, bigger and bolder fonts, and a clean white background that allows the album art to shine.‚Äù
Sound familiar? The design differs slightly from the blueprint used by Instagram and Airbnb (they use solid icons! What the heck Apple?) but the key elements are there: large bold headlines, black and white UI.
As I mentioned earlier, this means more and more of your favorite apps are going to start looking like one another. Why? Much like the NFL, tech is a copycat league. These redesigns were met with generally positive reviews (some people are complaining about a ‚Äòlack of personality‚Äô in these new black and white UIs but they‚Äôll soon get over that. You open an app for it‚Äôs functionality, not it‚Äôs personality) so I expect apps both new and old to start jumping on the CR bandwagon.
Now, whether you are for or against this monochromatic fad, it is undoubtedly a sign of progress. The product design process is advancing and evolving from the old segmented approach that encouraged superfluous design to a more holistic process that truly is focused on the user. In the old product design process a UI designer may be handed wireframes by a UX or product person with the instructions ‚Äòmake it pretty‚Äô. That designer would then spend hours or days adding color, removing color, changing color when the best solution may have been right there in front of them all along... the wireframes! As the lines between UX and UI designer blur in today‚Äôs more integrated design process, designers become less worried about their specific responsibilities (like making it pretty) and focus on the ultimate goal of creating the best product for their user.
So you‚Äôre sold on CR and ready to hop on the bandwagon? Good, follow these guidelines and you‚Äôll have an award winning app in no time.
Thanks for reading! Hit the heart if you enjoyed.

Please stop it for goodness sake. We know it by now!
When I talk to friends, or when I coach people, I always ask: ‚ÄúDo you keep a journal?‚Äù
This probably won‚Äôt surprise you, but the answer is almost always ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
And the funny thing is that everyone knows that they should keep one. But should is not enough. There are a lot of things that we should do‚Äîbut we don‚Äôt do them.
Why? We have no idea HOW to do them.
It‚Äôs just like when you were in school. Do you remember all those times you had a question on your mind but you didn‚Äôt ask. You probably thought: ‚ÄúMaybe the teacher thinks I‚Äôm dumb.‚Äù
Well, this is exactly the same. We all think that journaling is easy so we don‚Äôt bother asking how you do it. It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs also not rocket science.
Most people overcomplicate the act of journaling or putting your thoughts on paper. I think Ernest Hemingway put it best:
But how do you do that?
For me, there‚Äôs only one reason to keep a journal: To manage myself.
That‚Äôs the only practical reason I can think off. Why else would you keep a journal? It‚Äôs not that my life is so interesting that I can ever sell it as a memoir. I‚Äôm no John Krakauer or Maya Angelou.
No, I see journaling as a self-improvement tool. Nothing else.
Most of us still see journaling as a hobby or something that we do for fun or to relax. Sure, those reasons might be true for some. But for most, there‚Äôs only one why: Self-improvement.
How do you expect to improve yourself if you don‚Äôt know yourself? You truly get to know the quality of your thoughts when you write them down.
You can answer all these questions by reading your journal. Don‚Äôt know what to write? Here are 3 ideas.
Just write what you‚Äôve been doing. You can either do it in the morning or evening.
It doesn‚Äôt matter when you do, just try to write about what you‚Äôve done during the past 24 hours. It‚Äôs not same as an activity log, something I wrote about recently.
When I journal my activities, I record what time I went to bed, what time I woke up, what I worked on, who I talked to, what book I read, etc.
When I lack inspiration or motivation, I just go through my journal and see when I was inspired, felt energized, or motivated. Then, I recreate those events.
There‚Äôs no better way to address your worries than writing about them. If you worry about something, it seems way worse in your head.
When you start writing down what you‚Äôre stressed about, you can start thinking about how you‚Äôre going to solve the problem that‚Äôs causing you stress in the first place.
I‚Äôve been journaling about my fears for a long time now. And it truly helps. If you want to read more about that process, check out this article I wrote a while back.
Use your journal as a feedback mechanism by second-guessing your own decisions. Making decisions is hard.
For example:
Those are examples of big decisions. But you can also use it for all the small decisions in life.
Deep down, we kind of know the answers. We just don‚Äôt look deep enough.
Ask yourself a question and try to answer it by reasoning from multiple sides. What are the pros? What are the cons? What are the outcomes?
The questions you can ask yourself are endless.
There you have it. You see? It‚Äôs not complicated stuff.
Journaling is a very versatile tool. It helps you with your self-awareness, and it also helps you to improve yourself. If you‚Äôre serious about those things, a journal is a must.
Now, all you have to do is open a new page in your physical journal, or a document in your digital journal, and start writing:
There‚Äôs this weird thing‚Äîwhen you write things down, they become real. Start journaling and see it for yourself.
I‚Äôve made an eBook with 5 tips, exercises, and video training, that you can use to get immediate results. Curious?

But if you use the right tools, your life can be a lot easier and better.
My general opinion about apps, tools, and resources is this: It doesn‚Äôt matter.
I say that because most people hide behind their apps. We‚Äôre always looking for the ONE app that will turn us into a productivity monster.
Or we believe that tools or other resources will help us do better work.
YouTuber and filmmaker Casey Neistat makes this point very clear, he says:
When it comes to writing, Stephen King has a similar approach. Whenever he‚Äôs asked about tools, he doesn‚Äôt even answer. If you want to become a better writer, he says:
I‚Äôm sure you know there‚Äôs only one way to get things done: Put your head down and work fucking hard. But often, we still think these type of thoughts:
These are all reasons we procrastinate. Now, of course, tools matter. But they are not the determining factor. You are.
It‚Äôs not about the resources you have; it‚Äôs about what you do with them. Life is about resourcefulness. And that‚Äôs the point people like Casey Neistat and Stephen King want to make.
What you‚Äôll find next is a list of 7 of my favorite apps and how I use them. When you use the tools in the right way, you can easily save 10 hours per week.
If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre probably a knowledge worker. And a knowledge worker‚Äôs primary weapon is her words.
I strongly believe that if you want to become a better communicator, it all starts on paper. Learn how to think and write well, and you will ultimately become better at speaking, sales, copywriting, programming, doing interviews, leading, etc.
The very words you use are EVERYTHING in how you conduct yourself. Especially in an increasingly digital world where people shy away from face-to-face contact.
And Grammarly is the best tool to help you with communicating. Most people think a grammar checker is only for writers.
But I mainly use Grammarly‚Äôs browser extension for daily use. I use it for writing emails in Gmail, responding to comments, or any other site I have to write something.
I also edit my articles with Grammarly (they also have an MS Office add-on). It checks for passive voice, grammatical, spelling, and punctuation mistakes.
All in all, this app saves me about 30 minutes a day in sheer brainpower. With Grammarly, I can just focus on writing and communicating my message; they do the rest.
Reading improves focus, productivity, creativity, and it reduces stress. The benefits are so great that it makes you think everybody should be reading books like crazy.
Nope.
23% of Americans have not read a single book in the past year. And the number of books people read per year are also not pretty. Only 28% reads more than 11 books per year.
And I get it. Reading takes time. Plus, one of my main challenges is to select which books I‚Äôm going to read.
In the past, I‚Äôve often bought books, and quit them half-way through because they were not useful or interesting. That costs me time and money. That‚Äôs frustrating, especially because you can only read so many books every year.
If you‚Äôre like me, your reading list grows faster than you cross off books, and that‚Äôs a problem. Why? You want to read the RIGHT books. You want to read books that make you grow; personally, professionally, financially.
And I‚Äôve finally found a solution to the question of: ‚ÄúWhat book should I read next?‚Äù
Blinkist creates quality summaries of non-fiction books. Every day I read one book summary, and if I want to learn more, I get the actual book. If not, I just eliminate the book from my reading list.
You have to be realistic; you just can‚Äôt read all the books in the world. And it‚Äôs important to figure out how you decide which books you‚Äôre going to read.
Also, I don‚Äôt rely on reviews to select books because a book that‚Äôs useless to you can be valuable to me.
You should eliminate those two thoughts from your head. Why? Because they plant the seeds of something that‚Äôs called: WASTING TIME.
I use Trello as a backlog of tasks that I have to do. If you don‚Äôt know Trello; it‚Äôs a versatile project management tool that can be used in many ways.
With Trello you can create ‚Äòboards‚Äô for every project you have. And on every board, you can list all the actions you have to complete for that project.
Every week I take some time to update my projects. That helps me to improve my focus, so I know what I have to do.
Whenever I don‚Äôt know what to do, I open Trello: There‚Äôs ALWAYS something to do.
Browsing blogs remains one of the main sources of wasting time for most of us.
I have a simple tip for you: Stop clicking on articles you see in your social feeds.
Most people open Facebook, Twitter, or even news sites, and they click on anything thing that looks slightly interesting.
DON‚ÄôT.
Instead, make a list of 5‚Äì10 blogs/authors you love to read. Then, add them to Feedly or follow the bloggers/publications on Medium. Every day, only read your articles through Feedly and Medium.
This saves at least 1 hour of mindless browsing per week.
I still meet a lot of entrepreneurs and freelancers who don‚Äôt work in the cloud. If you‚Äôre one of them, you‚Äôre wasting a lot of time.
Just the few minutes it takes to open files from folders, save them on external drives, or share your documents with others, adds up quickly.
A few minutes here and there become a few hours a week, and hundreds of hours per year.
I use Office 365 because I like to work offline too (plus, I‚Äôm a little old school ‚Äî I‚Äôm used to Office). But Google Docs also works well.
Let‚Äôs keep this short: If you‚Äôre not working in the cloud, it‚Äôs time to move there.
I save about 1 hour per week by having easy access to all my documents (on all my devices) in the cloud. I only focus on working and sharing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
I don‚Äôt want to think about anything else that‚Äôs involved with productivity. And that‚Äôs what these apps are great at.
Forget about to-do lists, fancy productivity apps, or anything else that promises you to get shit done.
There‚Äôs only one thing that helps you to get things done: Your calendar.
It‚Äôs so obvious that most of us ignore it. We prefer fancy looking to-do lists with all colors of the rainbow, and that make sounds when you check off an item.
The research is clear: To-do lists don‚Äôt work. And yet, most people stick to them.
Ditch the to-do list and use your calendar as your number one productivity tool. Take some time to plan your week. Ask: When will I do what? Then, schedule it in your calendar. I do this exercise every day.
I promise that it will save you at least 15 minutes a day of updating your to-do list.
I love working with the Pomodoro method. Research shows that it improves focus and the quality of your output.
Whenever I don‚Äôt use an app like Tomighty, I just waste hours every day. This app can easily save you one hour per DAY.
How? When you work in intervals, you get more done in less time because of the improved focus.
As you might have noticed, productivity is all about eliminating time-wasting activities, and improving your focus.
In that way you get the RIGHT things done, and you ultimately save a lot of hours every week.
Start living more consciously of your time and productivity: Save your time for other, more important, things.
If you do that, you can use those precious hours with your family, friends, spouse. Or you can spend the time to improve your skills.
Because at the end of the ride, when you‚Äôre on your deathbed, you won‚Äôt think about all apps, tools, or resources you used. No, you‚Äôll reflect on all the great things you did with them.
So what are you waiting for? You have the tools you need to be successful. Only thing left is this: Go out and DO things with the resources you have.

Preethi Kasireddy|70K|12|https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-im-leaving-silicon-valley-72919edb3297?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|Why I‚Äôm leaving Silicon Valley ‚Äì Preethi Kasireddy ‚Äì Medium|"Here‚Äôs something I never thought I‚Äôd say: this is my last week in Silicon Valley.
This post is a personal one. Rather than sharing insights on Blockchain or Javascript, I‚Äôd like to walk through my inner journey the past few years.
It‚Äôs a journey that‚Äôs left me itching for change ‚Äî and driving down to Los Angeles to set up a new home base is a big one!
I moved to Silicon Valley during the summer of 2012, a little over five years ago. I had just graduated college and serendipitously landed here because of a new job offer. I was eager and anxious to start my career out here and frankly had no idea what to expect.
As it turned out, I lucked out ‚Äî Silicon Valley is one of the best places in the world for entrepreneurs, engineers, and anyone bold enough to try and change the world through technology.
...This was a stark contrast to life in my New Jersey hometown, where most people went to the community college, pursued 9-to-5 jobs, and settled into comfortable lives by their mid-20s. There was very little space there for thinking big, or taking risks, or creating your own career path.
So, landing in San Francisco was the best kind of culture shock imaginable. Suddenly, I was surrounded by technology and innovation and immersed in a community where challenging yourself was actually encouraged.
The next three years of living in San Francisco had a path-altering impact on my life, as I began to learn that crazy ideas aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù for those of us willing to put in the work and take a few risks.
That first post-college job was as an analyst at Goldman Sachs, where I was able to learn how tech company financials work at a fundamental level through working with CEOs and CFOs preparing for IPO rounds and acquisitions. This was hugely beneficial when I later moved on to working with some of those tech companies directly, and planted the seeds of my interest in solving problems with software.
After a year at Goldman Sachs, however, I realized that a career in banking was not what I wanted long term. I wanted to go back to being an engineer as I had been in college. So I decided to go against the grain and say goodbye to a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù position. Where was I off to next?
Well, I was on the brink of leaving to join as a systems engineer for a small industrial startup in the middle of the country. But after a random cold email followed by a long series of unexpected events, I got an offer to join Andreessen Horowitz on the deal team. It was an opportunity I couldn‚Äôt pass up ‚Äî and thank God I didn‚Äôt.
I spent the next two years at Andreessen Horowitz, where I worked with and learned from the pioneers of the web, like Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, Chris Dixon, and many others. I saw thousands of companies come through the doors ‚Äî I saw their ideas, their teams, their challenges and their strengths. I learned the ins and outs of building a successful technology startup, and on the flip side, learned the common mistakes that lead to failure. Most importantly, I met incredible entrepreneurs who inspired me to also become like them one day.
When I left a16z, I made the transition to software engineering. I was young and wanted to go out and just build stuff for the world. You could say that I had ‚Äúentrepreneur envy‚Äù ‚Äî I was eager to build products day to day, and eventually start my own company. I‚Äôve written about my experience extensively in the past.
This transition was nothing short of amazing. I was learning and growing at a break-neck pace. I was passionate and excited by my work. Frankly, I was having so much fun being an engineer that not a single day felt like ‚Äúwork‚Äù.
But beyond just loving my work, I also felt empowered. Empowered to do things I never thought were possible before. Because being an engineer gave me freedom. Freedom to build anything I want, whenever I want and wherever I want. The freedom to learn how everything works at a fundamental level. The freedom to teach and empower new developers. And most importantly, the freedom to be a creator and literally, create something from nothing.
It was only after I left Andreessen Horowitz to return to an engineering track that my feelings about life in Silicon Valley started to change.
Thanks to the freedoms of the developer lifestyle, I started to travel more and meet engineers from all around the world ‚Äî Paris, London, India, Vienna, Australia, Berlin, Tel Aviv, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea ‚Äî and I started to see that Silicon Valley wasn‚Äôt the only place where world-changing engineering, technology, and innovation was happening.
What I once thought was only something I could find in Silicon Valley, was starting to appear in every city I visited. Early seeds of technology and innovation were being planted in places like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Tel Aviv, India, Switzerland and even South Africa.
This isn‚Äôt exactly a surprise, since one of the Internet‚Äôs core functions is to make access to knowledge available everywhere. I personally taught myself almost everything I know about programming on the internet (outside some fundamentals from Hack Reactor), for free. And I‚Äôm just one of thousands of learners using the Internet to access information that used to be limited to elite colleges like Stanford, Berkeley, or MIT.
These days, techies aren‚Äôt limited to Silicon Valley if they want to find funding and a community. Many other cities with active and relevant tech scenes have their own unique cultures, art, cuisines, and activities to offer.
Despite it being the center of tech and innovation for decades, I‚Äôm not the only engineer to notice a degree of homogeny in Silicon Valley culture lately.
What made it homogenous was that everyone seemed to have a similar story ‚Äî whether they were software engineers, product managers, venture capitalists or entrepreneurs. The career paths and goals may have been different from what my home town in New Jersey offered... but within the Valley, you‚Äôd hear the same stories over and over.
Every coffee shop I went to or restaurant I ate at, I‚Äôd overhear people talking about their $20M rounds, $200M exits or their 200% YoY growth. What was once a beautiful thing ‚Äî the like-mindedness ‚Äî was no longer beautiful to me. I started to notice a lot of similar thinking ‚Äî group think as they call it.
Silicon Valley is paradoxically a predictable place founded on the idea of being unpredictable.
This isn‚Äôt to say Silicon Valley hasn‚Äôt taught me anything important.
It‚Äôs been a perfect place to learn to take risks. A place to learn the value of creating your own path, and to prove to myself that I can do it.
While living here, I‚Äôve made a deliberate effort to say yes to my dreams. I wanted the freedom to build anything I want, and I earned that. I wanted to learn and grow as quickly as possible, and I‚Äôve proven that. I wanted to meet people from around the world and learn from them, and I got that. I wanted to find my purpose instead of following a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù path, and I did that.
Most importantly, I wanted to pave a path that is unique to me, and I‚Äôm doing exactly that. I‚Äôm only a couple years into it, and the future feels unlimited.
Looking back, when I left Andreessen Horowitz to pursue this path, I set out a three-part roadmap for myself:
I spent the past two years learning many different areas of programming (e.g. web development, mobile development, distributed systems, etc.) and various application areas (e.g. machine learning, blockchain, etc.). I purposely stayed broad and exposed myself to as much as possible, and learned to code things that interested me most. Eventually, I fell in love with blockchain development.
My fascination with blockchains started when we first made the investment in Coinbase at a16z, and ever since, I‚Äôve been keeping up with the technology and eventually joined Coinbase as a software engineer, which helped me further dive deeper into the space. After Coinbase, I continued to tinker and teach myself various aspects of blockchain, and now I‚Äôm at phase two, where I‚Äôm focusing on getting really good at it. The next step is to use my skills to ‚Äúbuild a world-changing company or something else entirely‚Äù.
Leading the path I want to lead doesn‚Äôt require me to be in Silicon valley anymore. I don‚Äôt need to be here to follow my personal roadmap. Having the freedom of an engineer to learn and grow as an entrepreneur, writer, and speaker has opened me up to a whole new world. It made me realize that I can be an engineer, entrepreneur, writer and speaker from anywhere in the world.
The world is becoming increasingly global. Silicon Valley is just one way of living. One way of thinking. One way of viewing the world. But there‚Äôs so many other ways. Because after all, technology is global, engineering is global, innovation is global and entrepreneurship is global.
It‚Äôs evident by the fact that we now see countries like India and China leap frog generations of western technology and even inventing their own ways ‚Äî take mPesa in Kenya, Paytm in India, or WeChat in China.
Moreover, it‚Äôs become easier than ever to connect with anyone thousands of miles away. Being physically present is no longer a requirement. I can code from South Africa and still ship a product to someone in Silicon Valley.
Beyond this, what really nudged me was when I realized that the blockchain revolution is global. I‚Äôve spent the past year doing research and development in blockchain technologies, and noticed that many cities outside of the valley, like New York, Berlin, Toronto, Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Bangkok, are making immense strides in pushing blockchains forward. Many well known projects and efforts to bring blockchain to the masses are being started from places outside of Silicon Valley. For once, I noticed that Silicon Valley isn‚Äôt the center of it.
So then a crazy idea came to my head. Can I leave Silicon Valley and still pursue my dreams? Can I still build a massive and world-changing company? Can I still make a big impact in this world?
The answer to that increasingly became a clear yes.
Of course, there‚Äôs a strong argument for staying in Silicon Valley. After all, this place has a massive network of entrepreneurs and people who ‚Äúget it‚Äù. This place knows how to breed amazing startups. Moreover, I‚Äôve personally built up a great network in Silicon Valley over the past five years. I could easily stay and lead a very successful life here, financially at least.
But frankly, I don‚Äôt want to. That feels a bit too easy. I‚Äôm young, passionate, and driven ‚Äî I can‚Äôt let inertia, familiarity, comfort or money hold me back from going on to to doing bigger and harder things. I‚Äôm going to challenge myself. I‚Äôm going to fight for my goals. To work day and night for them. And money isn‚Äôt going to get me any of these things.
Money has never been my main motivator. I left Goldman Sachs before my first-year bonus because I was too eager to sit back for two months hating my life, instead of starting my new career at a16z. Then I left an amazing career at a16z to go become a developer. Challenge and impact are what gets me out of bed in the morning.
I have this burning desire to do even more, see more and experience more, outside of Silicon Valley. When the opportunity exists to experience a whole new city and still do what I love, why not just go out there and try? Why not try to expose myself to ideas in a place where the opportunities are wide open? Why not meet other types of people, learn other skills, and live on the edge a little?
Here I am: ready to do exactly that!
Perhaps my feeling and frustrations towards Silicon Valley and San Francisco are merely a fact of being here for too long. Perhaps they‚Äôre just from me needing a change. Perhaps they‚Äôre just from finding my true calling as an engineer, builder, writer and entrepreneur and realizing that I can do that from anywhere.
I‚Äôm ready to pick up my bags and embark onto the next adventure in Los Angeles.
Am I scared?
Hell yeah I‚Äôm scared.
I know practically no one in Los Angeles except for a few college friends who I haven‚Äôt spoken to in years. While on one hand, this sounds scary, on the other hand, I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôm beyond ecstatic to get out there and build up my network from ground up, just like I have done for the past five years in Silicon Valley.
And the best part is, I can always come back here ‚Äî for a day, a week or a month. Silicon Valley is where my entire network is, and they aren‚Äôt going anywhere. If I come back a year, or two years, or even five years from now, most of them will still be here.
So why the heck would I choose Los Angeles of all places? Lots of reasons!
Of course, every city has it‚Äôs flaws. Let‚Äôs not even get into the traffic situation in LA ;)
As some of you may know, I‚Äôve been heavily focused in the blockchain space for a while now. I hope to share more details about my next project in the coming months.
In the meantime, look out for more updates from me, whether it‚Äôs posts to teach you blockchain, videos for my #AskPreethi series, or pictures of me sitting on Venice beach with my laptop being a nerd and coding üòé
Still here? Good! Here‚Äôs the mic. Have you ever made a ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù move to chase something you wanted? Tell me about it in the comments so we can keep the fire going!
Blockchain Engineer. I have a passion for understanding things at a fundamental level and sharing it as clearly as possible.

Daniel Colin James|69K|7|https://hackernoon.com/how-google-collapsed-b6ffa82198ee?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|This is how Google will collapse ‚Äì Hacker Noon|"Google made almost all its money from ads. It was a booming business ‚Äî until it wasn‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs how things looked right before the most spectacular crash the technology industry had ever seen.
Search was Google‚Äôs only unambiguous win, as well as its primary source of revenue, so when Amazon rapidly surpassed Google as the top product search destination, Google‚Äôs foundations began to falter. As many noted at the time, the online advertising industry experienced a major shift from search to discovery in the mid-2010s.
While Google protected its monopoly on the dying search advertising market, Facebook ‚Äî Google‚Äôs biggest competitor in the online advertising space ‚Äî got on the right side of the trend and dominated online advertising with its in-feed native display advertising.
In late 2015, Apple ‚Äî Google‚Äôs main competitor in the mobile space ‚Äî added a feature to their phones and tablets that allowed users to block ads.
Devices running iOS were responsible for an estimated 75% of Google‚Äôs revenue from mobile search ads, so by making this move, Apple was simultaneously weighing in decisively on the great ad blocking debate of the 2010s and dealing a substantial blow to the future of online advertising.
A year later, as the internet went mobile, so too did ad blocking. The number of people blocking ads on a mobile device grew 102% from 2015 to 2016; by the end of 2016, an estimated 16% of smartphone users globally were blocking ads when browsing the internet on a mobile device. The number was as high as 25% for desktop and laptop users in the United States, a country that accounted for 47% of Google‚Äôs revenue.
The people most likely to block ads were also the most valuable demographic: millennials and high earners.
Internet users had spoken, and they hated ads.
In early 2017, Google announced its plans to build an ad blocker into its popular Google Chrome browser. Google‚Äôs ad blocker would only block ads that were deemed unacceptable by the Coalition For Better Ads, effectively allowing the company to use its dominant web browser to strengthen its already dominant advertising business.
Even after making this desperate and legally questionable move, it would quickly become clear to Google that even though ads were getting better, ad blocking numbers would continue to rise. Google had given even more people a small taste of what an ad-free internet experience could look like.
The company discovered that it wasn‚Äôt just annoying ads that people didn‚Äôt like; it was ads in general.
A key platform where Google served ads was YouTube, which it bought in 2006 and quickly turned into one of its biggest entities. But even with a sixth of the world visiting this video-sharing behemoth every month, YouTube never became profitable. In an attempt to combat the effect of ad blockers, YouTube launched an ad-free subscription model in late 2015, but the subscription numbers were underwhelming.
YouTube‚Äôs already insurmountable problems multiplied in early 2017 as advertisers began to pull out amid ad placement controversies, and huge revenue generators began to leave the site.
Even those who weren‚Äôt blocking ads had trained themselves to ignore them entirely. Researchers dubbed this phenomenon ‚Äúbanner blindness‚Äù. The average banner ad was clicked on by a dismal 0.06% of viewers, and of those clicks, roughly 50% were accidental.
Research showed that 54% of users reported a lack of trust as their reason for not clicking banner ads and 33% found them completely intolerable. These figures painted a pretty grim picture for the sustainability of online advertising, but especially for Google‚Äôs position within the industry.
If losing a major portion of their audience and annoying the rest wasn‚Äôt bad enough, Google also failed to get ahead of one of the biggest shifts in technology‚Äôs history. They recognized the importance of artificial intelligence but their approach missed the mark. Since Google‚Äôs search pillar had become unstable, a lot was riding on the company‚Äôs strategy for artificial intelligence.
Google‚Äôs then-CEO Sundar Pichai famously predicted in 2016 that ‚Äúthe next big step will be for the very concept of the ‚Äòdevice‚Äô to fade away‚Äù and that ‚Äúover time, the computer itself ‚Äî whatever its form factor ‚Äî will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world.‚Äù
Google‚Äôs ability to acknowledge the coming trend and still fail to land in front of it reminded many observers of its catastrophic failures in the booming industries of social media and instant messaging.
Meanwhile, in 2014, Amazon released a product called Amazon Echo, a small speaker that could sit in your home and answer questions, perform tasks, and buy things online for you. The Echo was a smash success. Google released its copycat product, Google Home, two years later, but it was already too late to catch up, and had no clear revenue strategy.
Alexa ‚Äî the assistant that lived inside the Echo ‚Äî on the other hand, was quickly integrated into several products and services, and its monetization model was clear, viable, and most importantly future-friendly. The Echo made it easy to order products through Amazon, and every time someone used an Echo to purchase something, Amazon made money.
Google extended the reach of their virtual assistant by building it into Android, but doing so still didn‚Äôt provide an answer for how the technology would generate enough revenue to sustain Google‚Äôs expanding repertoire of expensive innovations.
Google‚Äôs ads relied on screens, yet voice interaction subverted screens entirely. Google briefly tried playing audio ads with the Google Home, but consumers were far from receptive. Investors started to voice their concerns in 2017, but Sundar Pichai told them not to worry, leaving them to assume that Google would use their age-old strategy and analyze users‚Äô voice searches so that users could be shown more suitable ads on devices with screens.
Headlines in early 2017 proclaimed that ‚ÄúAlexa Just Conquered CES. The World is Next.‚Äù Amazon then made their technology available to third party manufacturers, putting even more distance between the two companies. Amazon had already beaten Google once before, holding 54% of the cloud computing market (compared to Google‚Äôs 3%) in 2016, and they were just getting started.
By early 2017, Amazon had begun closing in on the entire retail industry.
At its peak, Google had a massive and loyal user-base across a staggering number of products, but advertising revenue was the glue that held everything together. As the numbers waned, Google‚Äôs core began to buckle under the weight of its vast empire.
Google was a driving force in the technology industry ever since its disruptive entry in 1998. But in a world where people despised ads, Google‚Äôs business model was not innovation-friendly, and they missed several opportunities to pivot, ultimately rendering their numerous grand and ambitious projects unsustainable. Innovation costs money, and Google‚Äôs main stream of revenue had started to dry up.
In a few short years, Google had gone from a fun, commonplace verb to a reminder of how quickly a giant can fall.

Ben Yu|12.2K|75|https://medium.com/@intenex/cryptocurrency-101-7197684775fd?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|Cryptocurrency 101 ‚Äì Ben Yu ‚Äì Medium|"Ever since Nas Daily‚Äôs video came out about how I earned over $400,000 with less than $10,000 investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum, I‚Äôve been getting hundreds of questions from people around the world about how to get started with cryptocurrency investment.
First: I‚Äôm super glad there‚Äôs so much interest in cryptocurrency right now. I firmly do believe that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has the potential to fundamentally change much of the way our world currently operates for the better. It reminds me a lot of the internet in the 90s.
Second: Investment in cryptocurrency isn‚Äôt something to be taken lightly. It‚Äôs extremely risky, extremely speculative, and extremely early stage still at this point in time. Countless speculators and day traders have lost their entire fortunes trading cryptocurrency. I was no different when I first started investing in crypto. The first $5000 I put into crypto fell almost immediately to less than $500 ‚Äî a net loss of over 90%.
Third: All of the following words are entirely and solely my own opinion, and do not reflect any objective truth in the world or the opinions or perspective of any other individual or entity. I write them here merely so people can know how I personally approach cryptocurrency, and what I have personally found helpful in my foray into this realm.
I‚Äôm firmly of the opinion that one should never invest in something one doesn‚Äôt thoroughly understand, so I‚Äôm going to split this article into three parts.
The first part will speak to a broad explanation of what bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large are. The second will discuss my personal investment philosophy as it pertains to crypto. The third will show you step by step how to actually begin investing in crypto, if you so choose. Each section will be clearly delineated, so feel free to skip parts if they‚Äôre already familiar to you.
Great question. If you want the full story behind the advent of bitcoin, I highly recommend the book Digital Gold. It traces the entire history of bitcoin from its inception all the way up to 2015. It‚Äôs an engrossing read, and highly informative.
For now, let‚Äôs start with a quick history lesson about bitcoin. Bitcoin was officially unveiled to the public in a white paper published October 31st, 2008. The white paper is actually extremely readable, very short (just 8 pages), and incredibly elegantly written. If you want to understand why bitcoin is so compelling straight from the horse‚Äôs mouth, you must read this paper. It will explain everything better than I or anyone else likely ever could.
I won‚Äôt delve too much into the technical details of how bitcoin works (which are better elucidated in the white paper), but will instead focus on a broader exploration of its history and implications.
Bitcoin was invented in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, and the crisis was a clear motivating factor for its creation.
Numerous banks and other financial institutions failed across the world, and had to be bailed out by governments at the expense of their taxpayers. This underscored the fragility of the modern financial system, where the health of our monetary system is reliant on banks and other financial institutions that we are forced to trust to make wise and prudent decisions with the money we give them. Too often for comfort, they fail to carry out this fiduciary responsibility to an adequate degree.
Of particular note is fractional reserve banking. When you give a bank $1,000, the bank doesn‚Äôt actually keep all that money for you. It goes out and is legally allowed to spend up to $900 of your money, and keep just $100 in the off chance that you ask for your money back.
In the most simplistic case, if you are the only depositor at this bank, and you ask for more than $100 back at once, the bank won‚Äôt be able to give you your money, because it doesn‚Äôt have it any more.
Shockingly, this is actually how banks work in reality. In the United States, the reserve requirement, or the percentage of net deposits banks are actually required to keep in liquid financial instruments on hand, is generally 10% for most banks. This means that if a bank has net deposits of a billion dollars, it needs to only keep 100 million on hand at any given time.
This is fine most of the time, as generally the customers of that bank won‚Äôt all try to cash out at the same time, and the bank is able to stay liquid. However, the moment customers start to question the bank‚Äòs financial stability, things can go south very quickly. If just a small number of customers begin asking for all their deposits back, a bank can rapidly become depleted of all its liquid funds.
This leads to what‚Äôs known as a bank run, where the bank fails because it is unable to fulfill all the withdrawals customers demand. This can escalate quickly into a systemic bank panic, where multiple banks begin to suffer the same fate. Each successive failure compounds the collective panic, and quite quickly, the whole system can begin to collapse like a house of cards.
This is what led in large part to the Great Depression, for instance. The whole system is fundamentally predicated on trust in the system, and the second that vanishes, everything can go south incredibly quickly.
The financial crisis of 2008 highlighted yet another risk of the modern banking system. When a bank goes out and spends the 90% of net deposits it holds in investments, it can often make very bad bets, and lose all that money. In the case of the 2008 crisis, banks in particular bet on high risk subprime mortgages. These were mortgages taken out by borrowers very likely to become delinquent, to purchase houses that were sharply inflated in value by the rampant ease of acquiring a mortgage.
When those mortgages were defaulted on, the artificially inflated values of the homes began to collapse, and banks were left holding assets worth far less than the amount they had lent out. As a consequence, they now had nowhere near the amount of money that customers had given them, and began experiencing liquidity crises that led to their ultimate bankruptcy and demise.
After the Great Depression occurred, the government attempted to address this issue by creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which technically guarantees all customer deposits in participating banks up to $250,000 per account.
Unfortunately, the FDIC is just as dramatically underfunded as banks are. As the FDIC itself acknowledges, it holds enough money to cover just over 1% of all the deposits it insures. In other words, if banks reneged on any more than 1% of all their deposits, the FDIC itself would also fail, and everyone would yet again be left in the dust without recourse.
In fact, this has already happened. The FDIC used to have a sister corporation that insured savings and loan institutions, as it itself at the time only insured bank deposits, and not savings and loan institution deposits. This was known as the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, or FSLIC.
In the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, over 1,000 of the 3,200 savings and loan institutions in the United States failed in rapid succession. The FSLIC almost immediately became insolvent itself, and had to be recapitalized several times with over $25 billion dollars of taxpayer money. Even this didn‚Äôt even come close to being sufficient to solve the crisis, and the FSLIC managed to only resolve the failure of less than 300 of the 1000 bankrupt institutions, even with all the handouts from taxpayers, before it just flat out gave up and dissolved itself.
For the most part, things generally work fine on a day to day basis. This belies, however, the true fragility of the system. It‚Äôs hard to anticipate these things before they happen, because it‚Äôs so easy to fall into the trap of assuming that things will always be as they mostly always have been. If things have been fine yesterday, and the day before, and the few years before that, or even the few decades before that, we just naturally assume that they will continue to be fine for the indefinite future.
History has proven this to be an often fatal assumptive error. The second things start to stop working, they tend to stop working in an extremely rapid, catastrophic fashion. There‚Äôs very little, if anything, stopping us from seeing another Great Depression sometime in the future, be it the near or longer term future. When that does happen ‚Äî and it almost certainly will, sooner or later, if history is any good teacher ‚Äî those who haven‚Äôt adequately prepared for it and taken appropriate prophylactic measures may very well find themselves in a bad spot.
Mistrust in fiat currencies, or currencies created and backed solely by faith in a government, both because of the modern banking system and because of the inherent nature of fiat currency, has in large part been why gold has been used as such a reliable store of value over millennia.
Fiat currencies are the world‚Äôs predominant form of currency today. The US dollar or the British pound, for instance, are fiat currencies. These are currencies that are entirely controlled in their supply and creation by a national government, and are backed by nothing but faith in that government.
This has proved a mistake countless times throughout history. Zimbabwe is a classic example, where the Zimbabwean dollar, thanks to an incompetent government among other factors, experienced enormous levels of hyperinflation. At one point, inflation was estimated at almost 80 billion percent in just a single month.The following image gives an idea of just how rapidly and absurdly a fiat currency can spiral out of control, once it reaches the point of no return.
Lest we think this an isolated instance, Venezuela is experiencing incredibly similar hyperinflation in the present-day, right this moment. The Venezuelan BoliÃÅvar inflated over 800% in 2016, and shows no signs of stopping in 2017.
The US hasn‚Äôt been immune to these crises, either. The US began its foray into fiat currency with the issuance of Continental Currency in 1775. Just three years later, Continental Currency was worth less than 20% of its original value. 13 years later, hyperinflation entirely collapsed the currency, and the US had to pass a law guaranteeing that all future currencies would be backed by gold and silver, and that no unbacked currencies could be issued by any state.
In comparison, the early history of the US dollar makes the relative volatility of bitcoin in these first 9 years look like peanuts.
Once adopted out of necessity, the gold standard became part and parcel of US currency, just as it was with most other currencies from around the world. The gold standard removed some of the need to have pure faith in US dollars in of themselves, as it guaranteed that all paper money the US issued would be exchangeable at a fixed rate for gold upon demand.
Naturally, you still had to believe that the government would actually keep enough gold to fulfill all these demands (deÃÅjaÃÄ vu and foreshadowing, anyone? Any flashbacks to fractional reserve banking yet?), but it was certainly better than nothing.
Gold, unlike fiat currencies, requires no trust and faith in a government to responsibly manage its money supply and other financial dealings in order to believe that it will retain its value well over time. This is because gold has no central authority that controls it and effectively dictates its supply and creation arbitrarily. Gold is fundamentally scarce, and only a small amount of it can be mined every year and added to the whole net supply. To date, the estimated total of all the gold ever mined in the history of humankind is only 165,000 metric tons. To put that in perspective, all that gold wouldn‚Äôt even fill up 3.5 Olympic sized swimming pools.
No government, no matter how much they wanted to or needed to, could simply conjure up more gold on demand. Fiat currencies, on the other hand, can and often have been printed on demand by governments whenever they happened to be short on cash and needed a quick infusion.
This printing of more money generally leads to inflation, as the total value of all the money in existence rationally should stay the same, no matter how many dollars are printed. Hence, if more dollars are printed, each dollar is worth fractionally less of the total money supply.
In fact, governments design their currencies and monetary policies to inflate intentionally. This is why $100 US dollars in 1913 (when the government officially started tracking inflation rates) is equivalent to $2,470 dollars today, just over 100 years later.
In fact, the average inflation rate of the US dollar over that time period was about 3.22%. This seems low, but in reality means that prices double just every twenty years. In other words, your money becomes half as valuable if you keep it in US dollars every twenty years. Doesn‚Äôt seem ultra cool to me.
Gold, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt inflate like fiat currencies do. That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs an intrinsically limited supply, and consequently, things tend to cost the same in gold over long periods of time. In fact, 2,000 years ago, Roman centurions were paid about 38.58 ounces of gold. In US dollars today, this comes out to about $48,350. The base salary of a captain in the US army today comes out to just about the same at $48,500.
This makes gold, in many ways, a better store of value based on fundamental principles than fiat currencies over time. You don‚Äôt have to trust anyone to trust that your gold will retain its value relatively well across the sands of time.
Unfortunately, the gold standard collapsed multiple times during the 20th century and was ultimately abandoned altogether by almost every nation in the world, because governments effectively played fractional reserve banking with their gold reserves. Who could blame them? It must be irresistibly tempting, knowing that in all likelihood, the vast majority of the time, only a fraction of people will ever want to trade in their dollars for gold. Why hold all that gold when you could hold just a fraction of it and get to spend the rest with no consequences in the short term?
Inevitably, this caught up with each and every government over time. For the United States, the gold standard was suspended in the aftermath of the Great Depression. The Bretton Woods international agreement instituted in the aftermath of World War II restored the gold standard to the US dollar, but this was short lived.
Under the Bretton Woods system, numerous foreign governments held US dollars as an indirect and more convenient method of holding gold, as US dollars were supposedly directly exchangeable at a fixed rate for gold. However, by 1966, gold reserves actually held by the US were already pitifully low, with only $13.2 billion worth of gold being held by the government.
By 1971, other governments had caught on to this, and began demanding the exchange of all their US dollars for gold, as was promised to them. Naturally, the US had nowhere near enough gold to fulfill their promises, and this became a government version of the bank run, essentially.
The US chose instead to fully renege on their promised exchange rate, and announced in what was known as the Nixon shock that the US dollar would no longer be redeemable for gold, and would henceforth be backed solely by faith in the US government (very faith-inspiring, no?).
Almost every nation quickly followed suit, and since then, fiat currencies have been allowed free reign to grow as they please with no accountability whatsoever in how much a government chooses to expand their money supply.
This, thus, requires anyone holding fiat currencies to have extreme trust that their government will manage their money supply responsibly, and not make poor financial decisions that will severely devalue the currency they hold. This compounds with the trust one must hold in the banks in which one deposits their fiat currency, to create an ultimate monetary system that has multiple points of very real possible failure, as history has shown time and again.
Holding gold privately removes the need to trust either of these points of failure in the modern banking system, but comes with its own host of problems. Namely, while gold has proven to be an excellent store of value over time, it is incredibly poor for actual day to day use in the modern economy. To transact with gold is excessively cumbersome and inconvenient. No one would consider walking around with an ounce of gold on them, measuring and shaving off exact portions of gold to pay for a cup of coffee, groceries, or a bus ride. Worse, it‚Äôs even more difficult and time consuming to send gold to anyone who isn‚Äôt physically in the same exact location as you.
For these reasons among others, fiat currencies have traditionally been preferred for everyday use, despite their many shortcomings and associated inherent risks.
No solution to this tradeoff conundrum has heretofore been discovered, or even necessarily possible. Bitcoin, however, with the aid of recent technological advances (computers and the internet), solves all of these issues. It takes the best of both worlds, and puts it into one beautiful, elegant solution.
Holy long-windedness, batman! 2,700 words later, and we finally get to talking about bitcoin. I‚Äôm as relieved as you are. Remind me never to write again.
Bitcoin was designed, essentially, as a better ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô. It incorporates all of the best elements of gold ‚Äî its inherent scarcity and decentralized nature ‚Äî and then solves all the shortcomings of gold, in allowing it to be globally transactable in precise denominations extremely quickly.
How does it do this? In short, by emulating gold‚Äôs production digitally. Gold is physically mined out of the ground. Bitcoin is also ‚Äòmined‚Äô, but digitally. The production of bitcoin is controlled by code that dictates you must find a specific answer to a given problem in order to unlock new bitcoins.
In technical terms, bitcoin utilizes the same proof-of-work system that Hashcash devised in 1997. This system dictates that one must find an input that when hashed, creates an output with a specific number of preceding zeros, among a few other specific requirements.
This is where the ‚Äòcrypto‚Äô, incidentally, in cryptocurrency comes from. Cryptographic hash functions are fundamentally necessary for the functioning of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as they are one-way functions. One-way functions work such that it is easy to calculate an output given an input, but near impossible to calculate the original input given the output. Hence, cryptographic one-way hash functions enable bitcoin‚Äôs proof of work system, as it ensures that it is nigh-impossible for someone to just see the output required to unlock new bitcoins, and calculate in reverse the input that created that output.
Instead, one must essentially brute-force the solution, by trying every single possible input in order to find one that creates an output that satisfies the specified requirements.
Bitcoin is further ingeniously devised to guarantee that on average, new bitcoins are only found every 10 minutes or so. It guarantees this by ensuring that the code that dictates the new creation of bitcoin automatically increases the difficulty of the proof-of-work system in proportion to the number of computers trying to solve the problem at hand.
For instance, in the very beginning of time, it was only the creator of bitcoin who was mining for bitcoins. He used one computer to do so. For simplicity‚Äôs sake, let‚Äôs assume this one computer could try 1000 different values to hash a second. In a minute, it would hash 60,000 values, and in 10 minutes, 600,000 values.
The algorithm that dictates the mining of bitcoins, therefore, would ensure that on average, it would take 600,000 random tries of hashing values to find one that would fulfill the requirements of the specified output required to unlock the next block of bitcoins.
It can do this by making the problem more or less difficult, by requiring more or less zeros at the beginning of the output that solves the problem. The more zeros that are required at the beginning of the output, the more exponentially difficult the problem becomes to solve. To understand why this is, click here for a reasonably good explanation.
In this case, it would require just the right amount of leading zeros and other characters to ensure that a solution is found on average every 600,000 or so tries.
However, imagine now that a new computer joins the network, and this one too can compute 1000 hashes a second. This effectively doubles the rate at which the problem can be solved, because now on average 600,000 hashes are tried every 5 minutes, not 10.
Bitcoin‚Äôs code elegantly solves this problem by ensuring that every 2,016 times new bitcoin is mined (roughly every 14 days at 10 minutes per block), the difficulty adjusts to become proportional to how much more or less hashing power is mining for bitcoin, such that on average new bitcoin continues to be found roughly every ten minutes or so.
You can see the present difficulty of mining bitcoin here. It should be evident from a half-second glance that the amount of computing power working to mine bitcoin right now is immense, and the difficulty is proportionally similarly immense. As of the time of this writing right now, there are close to 5 billion billion hashes per second being run to try to find the next block of bitcoin.
This system holds a lot of advantages even over gold‚Äôs natural system of being mined out of the ground. Gold‚Äôs mining is effectively random and not dictated by any perfect computer algorithm, and is consequently much more unpredictable in its output at any given moment. If a huge supply of gold is serendipitously found somewhere, it could theoretically dramatically inflate the rate at which gold enters the existing supply, and consequently cause an unanticipated decrease in the unit price of gold.
This isn‚Äôt just theoretical ‚Äî it‚Äôs the reality of gold production. This graph illustrates vividly the fact that gold production has been dramatically increasing over time, and is today over four times higher than just a hundred years ago.
In fact, more than half of all the gold that has ever been mined in the history of humankind has been mined in just the past 50 years. The difficulty of mining gold doesn‚Äôt proportionally increase with the number of people mining it, or with technological innovations that make it significantly easier to locate and mine gold over time.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, will always be mined on a carefully regulated schedule, because it can perfectly adapt no matter how many people begin to mine it or how technologically advanced bitcoin mining hardware becomes.
In fact, it‚Äôs already known for certain that there will only ever be a total of 21 million bitcoins in the world.
This is because the amount of bitcoin that is mined every time a hash problem is solved and a new block is created halves every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every 4 years.
The initial reward per block used to be 50 bitcoins back in 2009. After about four years, this dropped to 25 bitcoins in late 2012. The last halving occurred in July 2016, and dropped the reward per block mined to 12.5. In 2020, this should go down to 6.25, in 2024, 3.125, and so forth, all the way until the reward drops to essentially zero.
When all is said and done, there will hence be 21 million bitcoins. Exactly that, no more, no less. Elegant, no? This eliminates yet another risk with extant currencies, gold included: there are absolutely no surprises when it comes to knowing the present and future supply of bitcoin. A million bitcoin will never be found randomly in California one day and incite a digital gold rush.
On top of this, bitcoin is trivially divisible to any arbitrary degree. Presently, the smallest unit of bitcoin is known as a satoshi, and is one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 bitcoins = 1 satoshi).
This means that unlike gold, bitcoin is perfectly suited to not only being an inflation-proof store of value, but also a day-to-day transactable currency as well, as it is easily divisible to any arbitrary amount. You can buy a cup of coffee with it just as easily as you can buy a car.
Moreover, bitcoin can be sent incredibly quickly and remotely over the internet to anyone anywhere in the world. This is because when bitcoin is mined, the miners are actually providing a service in powering the bitcoin network.
What happens when a miner mines bitcoin is actually that they add a ‚Äòblock‚Äô to what is known as the ‚Äòblockchain‚Äô. The blockchain is a ledger that contains a record of every transaction ever made with bitcoins since its inception. When someone decides to mine bitcoin, they must download the entire blockchain as it presently stands.
Then, when they successfully find a solution to the next hash problem and mine a block of bitcoins, something magical happens. They get to add the block they just mined to the end of the existing blockchain ‚Äî and with it, they include every transaction that was initiated on the bitcoin network since the last block was mined. They then propagate this block they just created to the rest of the network of bitcoin miners, who all then update their own blockchains with this new block, and begin working on solving the next hash problem.
As a reward for providing this valuable service, miners are allowed to add a single transaction to the beginning of the block they mined, called the ‚Äòcoinbase transaction‚Äô. This transaction contains the brand new bitcoin that was created when they mined the block, and allows the miner to claim this bitcoin for themselves.
At this point, a particularly shrewd reader might become concerned with the fact that the reward for mining a new block of bitcoin gradually shrinks to zero. Won‚Äôt this cause miners to stop mining bitcoin, and consequently to stop providing the invaluable service that allows the bitcoin network to function and for transactions to be sent?
The answer is no, because miners are not solely rewarded by the new bitcoin that is generated each time they mine a block. Users may also send a transaction fee along with their transactions, which is paid out to any miner who decides to include their transaction in a block they mine. Over time, as the bitcoin network becomes used for more and more transactions, it is expected that transaction fees will be more than sufficient for incentivizing enough miners to continue mining blocks to keep the bitcoin network safe, secure, and robust.
It‚Äôs important that enough miners keep trying to mine blocks because this is another valuable service miners provide the network. Bitcoin, like gold, is powerful as a store of value because it is decentralized and trustless. There is no one central authority who holds all the power over bitcoin, just like no central authority holds power over gold.
No one person or government can decide to conjure up more bitcoin on demand, or to take it away. The only way the rules that govern bitcoin can be changed is if the software bitcoin miners run to mine bitcoin is changed.
Technically, any bitcoin miner could decide to change the software they run to mine bitcoin at any time. However, this still doesn‚Äôt have any impact on changing bitcoin itself. What it would do is cause a ‚Äòhard fork‚Äô, or a divergence in the block chain.
This occurs because any block that the rogue miner who changed their software mines won‚Äôt be accepted by all the other miners who are still running the original software. Consequently, all the other miners will begin mining different blocks, and adding those to their blockchain. This leads to a fork in the road, essentially, where two completely different blockchains are formed ‚Äî one by the rogue miner, and one by all the other miners.
Everything up to the point of the software change remains the same in both blockchains, but after that change, the blockchains diverge. Once diverged, they can never be reconciled and remerged.
This isn‚Äôt a concern, however, because the bitcoin network runs on consensus, and accepts whichever blockchain is the longest. In practice, this means that whichever blockchain has the most computing power behind it is effectively guaranteed to win, as they‚Äôll be able to calculate the solutions to the hash problems and find new blocks faster than their less powerful competitors.
This does mean that in theory, bitcoin is vulnerable to what‚Äôs known as a 51% attack ‚Äî an attack in which if a single entity was able to gain control of at least 51% of the total hashing power being directed at bitcoin mining, it could outpace a legitimate blockchain and temporarily take control of the network.
This is an extraordinarily difficult feat to accomplish, however, as the more people there are mining bitcoin, the harder it is to take over the network. At the current worldwide mining rate of almost 5 billion gigahashes a second, it would be extraordinarily difficult for even the most powerful organizations in the world (e.g., large-scale governments) to mount a successful 51% attack. It would be enormously costly, and quite possibly more financially detrimental to the attacker than to the network.
Indeed, the only thing a 51% attacker could really accomplish is destroying collective faith in bitcoin. They couldn‚Äôt somehow steal and gain all the value of bitcoins for itself. The attacker wouldn‚Äôt be able to generate new bitcoins on demand arbitrarily, and would still have to mine for them. They also would have no control over taking bitcoins created in the past that didn‚Äôt belong to them. The only thing they could do, really, is repeatedly spend bitcoin they already owned again and again, but even this is limited in its value, because ‚Äòhonest‚Äô miner nodes would never accept these fraudulent payments.
Hence, no rationally self-interested bitcoin miner would ever try to mount a 51% attack, as in all likelihood, they would lose massive amounts of money doing so and gain almost nothing from the effort. The only reason someone would want to conduct a 51% attack is to attempt to destroy faith in bitcoin ‚Äî large governments, for instance, who might one day feel that their fiat currencies that presently provide them great value to them are becoming threatened by bitcoin. However, the likelihood even of these enormous entities to successfully conduct a 51% attack is already becoming vanishingly small, as mining power increases.
Thus, bitcoin has perfectly utilized recent technological advances to create something heretofore impossible: an extremely safe, reliable, decentralized, and globally transactable digital and better version of gold, and possibly of all types of extant currency at large.
The advantages don‚Äôt stop there, however. Bitcoin is also ‚Äòpseudonymous‚Äô, meaning that while all transactions ever conducted on the network are public and known by all as everything is recorded in the blockchain, unless someone knows who owns the bitcoins that are being used in these transactions, there is no way to trace those bitcoins and transactions back to a given person or entity.
This serves a dual purpose of both allowing extreme transparency when desired in making transactions, and also allowing a lot of anonymity when desired. If one wants to ensure that they have perfect undeniable proof of their transactions, all they have to do is prove they own certain bitcoins, and then any and all transactions conducted with those bitcoins are undeniably theirs and most certainly occurred.
If one wants, rather, to keep the movement of their money less overt, one simply needs to ensure that the bitcoins they own are never tied to their identities, and that their transactions on the network are obfuscated. This can be accomplished with a variety of methods, such as using a tumbler, which allows one to send bitcoins to an intermediary service that will mix these bitcoins with bitcoins from numerous other sources, and then send bitcoins forward to the intended destination from sources entirely unrelated to the sender‚Äôs original bitcoins.
To clarify this a bit more, bitcoins are stored at what are known as ‚Äòaddresses‚Äô. Think of this as an email address or a mailing address. These addresses allow for the storage, sending, and receiving of bitcoin. The blockchain ledger contains a complete record of the movement of bitcoins from one address to another.
A tumbler allows someone who say, wants to move bitcoins from address 10 to address 100, to instead move their bitcoins from address 10 to a totally random address, say 57. In some other transaction, the tumbler has accepted bitcoins from someone entirely unrelated at say, address 20, who wanted to send the coins ultimately to 200 and sent these instead to another completely random address 42. It then sends the coins stored at address 42 from sender 2 to the address sender 1 originally desired, 100, and sends the coins stored at address 57 from sender 1 to the address sender 2 desired, 200.
This is highly simplified, but effectively how a tumbler works, albeit at much larger scale, and with many more senders and receivers of all sorts of varying amounts.
This ability to transact more anonymously in a digital, global fashion than ever before has indeed opened the gateway to some of bitcoin‚Äôs more infamous use cases. Much illicit activity has been enabled by this pseudonymity of bitcoin, including the sale of drugs and other illegal goods online. A more recent development has also been ransomware, whereby malware can now cut straight to the chase and lock up your computer and demand straight up money in the form of bitcoin in exchange for the release of your computer‚Äôs data.
These developments have been enabled not only by bitcoin‚Äôs pseudonymity, but also the irrevocability of transactions. Unlike current forms of digital payment, such as credit cards and bank transfers, bitcoin transactions are irreversible and do not involve any middleman who can mediate between disputes.
This has its disadvantages, but also its advantages, and was indeed one of the primary benefits the creator of bitcoin (a pseudonymous as-of-yet unidentified figure himself, Satoshi Nakamoto) outlined in the bitcoin white paper. In his own words:
As Satoshi notes, bitcoin‚Äôs irreversible, trustless nature removes the need for any middlemen to mediate and broker the process of payments from one person to another. Middlemen (e.g. banks and credit card networks) inherently introduce overhead costs and inefficiency into the system, which make transactions ‚Äî and micropayments in particular ‚Äî more costly than would otherwise be the case.
Fraud is also inherently eliminated, as any transaction propagated and confirmed by the bitcoin network by 6 or more blocks is generally accepted to be impossible to ever revoke.
Trustlessness in this sense is a huge component and advantage of bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large. Another ground-breaking innovation the blockchain introduces is the concept of a smart contract, or a contract that similarly requires no trust or middleman to mediate, but is rather contractually executed in a deterministic fashion through code run on the blockchain.
Traditionally, with a legal contract, two parties agree to certain terms with the understanding that if one party reneges, the other party can seek legal recourse with the governmental justice system. Lawsuits, however, can often be inordinately expensive, and in many cases the outcome is far from certain. A good or bad lawyer can make or break a case, and one is also at the mercy of a judge and/or jury and their subjective, possibly mercurial whims. Not the most efficient or foolproof system.
A contract written with and enforced by code, however, removes the need to trust a third party arbitrator (such as a court system), in much the same way that transactions enforced by bitcoin‚Äôs code remove the need to trust a third party financial institution. The code is written in such a way that clearly specifies the conditions of the contract, and will automatically enforce these conditions.
For instance, if two parties decide to make a bet on Donald Trump winning the election, historically, this could only be done by either word of honor or by some ad hoc legal contract. For a say, small $100 bet, it would be absolutely a non-starter to pursue legal action in the case that one of the parties decided to renege on the deal in the aftermath of the election. Normally, the reneged-upon party would simply be left in the dust without recourse.
With the advent of smart contracts made possible by the blockchain, however, this is (soon-to-be) a thing of the past. One can create a simple smart contract at effectively almost no cost that specifies in code that each party will send it $100 in bitcoin, and that upon the completion of the election process, it will either send all $200 to the party that bet on Donald Trump winning the election, or send the $200 to the party that bet on him losing the election. No ifs, ands, or buts. The code is clear, objective, and deterministic. Either the contract is fulfilled in one direction, or it is fulfilled in the other. No need to trust the other party in the bet at all, much less a third party to mediate.
Ethereum, as will be noted later (hopefully in another article because my god I never want to write again), takes this concept to the next level and runs with it.
One further benefit to bitcoin is that it is truly yours to own, and you can keep it yourself, without the need for a bank or any other intermediary, and use it just as easily as you might a credit card. This ensures that you won‚Äôt fall victim to a banking system collapse brought on by fractional reserve banking or irresponsible government and financial institution fiscal policies in general. It also ensures, however, that no one can take your money from you even on an individual basis, global financial apocalypse aside.
This, like systemic banking failures, is not something most people generally have to worry about 99% of the time. However, in the 1% of cases where this does become an issue, it becomes a very serious issue. Refugees and other victims of persecution and oppression are clear examples of this.
As a refugee, generally, if you hope to escape with your money, you have to carry it in physical form on you, either in gold or in paper currency. This is limiting for a few reasons: one, you can only take so much as you can carry or convert to physical form, and two, physical currencies are exceedingly simple to detect and confiscate.
Again, while this all seems incredibly far-fetched today for most people (but not all, as the present day European migrant crisis has made abundantly clear), it happens much more often than one might expect. A little remembered fact is that the United States itself once outlawed the possession of gold, back in 1933 with Executive Order 6102, and forced all its citizens to relinquish all gold to the United States at a fixed price of $20.67 per troy ounce.
Immediately thereafter, the US Treasury revalued all their gold at $35 per troy ounce for foreign transactions, and in the process reaped an enormous profit at the expense of all the citizens that were forced to give up their gold at fire sale prices.
It sounds incredible, but this is real life. The government threatened to fine anyone caught possessing gold in violation of this order $10,000 ($185,000 today) and throw them in jail for up to ten years. A famous case involved one Frederick Barber Campbell, who had on deposit at Chase Bank over 5,000 ounces of gold (worth over $6 million today), and attempted to withdraw the gold that he rightfully owned. Chase refused to allow him to do so, so he decided to sue Chase for depriving him of his assets.
In response to his lawsuit (this case demonstrates the value of basically everything about bitcoin, from the ability to store your own money to the ability to not rely on the legal system for recourse), Campbell was counterattacked and indicted by a federal prosecutor, and had to defend himself in court for not giving up his gold.
Ultimately, while Campbell didn‚Äôt end up going to jail, the government did decide to seize all his gold, and confiscated all $6 million worth of gold from him.
It took a full 40 years, or until 1974, before Gerald Ford signed a bill making it once again legal for private individuals and corporations to own gold within the United States.
This underscores the oft mercurial whims of governments, even well-regarded ones like that of the United States, that most citizens heretofore have been subject to without relief or alternative. Most of the time, things run well enough that we all get by without having to think about this fact too much. Sometimes, however, things do go really, really wrong.
Bitcoin fundamentally changes this equation. Unlike even gold, bitcoin is nigh impossible, when stored correctly, for anyone to confiscate without consent. The addresses at which bitcoin values are stored are protected by ‚Äòprivate keys‚Äô, which can be thought of as a password or a key to a lockbox. Without this private key, it is generally impossible to steal the bitcoins held at the public address to which the private key corresponds. So long as you keep this private key secure, your bitcoins are secure.
With things like brain wallets possible, this means that even in the worst case scenario, you can literally store your bitcoins in your brain and nowhere else, and thereby easily prevent their confiscation. Just yet another fundamental innovation in the evolution of currency that bitcoin has made possible ‚Äî its fully intangible nature is actually an asset.
The intangibility of bitcoin, however, does seem to hang some people up. It‚Äôs sometimes difficult to immediately conceive of how bitcoins could possibly hold value, as these people contend, when they are intrinsically worthless. They are nothing but a concept, backed up by some computer code. Gold is a physical, tangible object that you can hold in your hand. It has real uses in industry and as jewelry that lend it value. Even paper money can be used for kindling or toilet paper if the need necessitates.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is fully intangible. It is just a concept backed by code, no more, no less. It can‚Äôt be used for anything functional besides being transferred in concept to other people as a store of value. How could something like this possibly hold value like other existing currencies?
It‚Äôs a good question, and one that underscores just how interesting the concept of money really is, and how rarely we actually think critically about it.
Sure, let‚Äôs say that you can‚Äôt compare bitcoin to gold and say it‚Äôs better because gold has tangible, real-world utility and bitcoin doesn‚Äôt.
What is the value of that real-world utility? Only about 12% of gold purchased every year is actually used for industrial and medical purposes. If this is truly where gold‚Äôs value is derived from, gold would be worth dramatically less than it actually is.
To the other point, gold‚Äôs coveted status in jewelry is merely a derivative property of its perceived value, which leads to its designation as a status symbol. Without that underlying perceived value, it would command far less value in jewelry. Consequently, the question still remains about the gap between the industrial and medical value of gold and the actual value of gold as determined by the market. Where does the value in that gap come from?
This is even more true of paper currency. Yes, you can utilize and reuse the paper for all the intrinsic value paper has. But what is that intrinsic value of paper? This is easy to answer, because we can just see how much the government pays to make paper money. $1 and $2 bills cost less than 5 cents to make on the low end of the spectrum, while $100 bills cost 12.3 cents on the high end.
Even the $1 bill, which seems to be the best deal if one is valuing the worth of one‚Äôs currency based on its intrinsic ‚Äòtangible‚Äô value, has only ~5 cents worth of actual paper value behind it, or <5% of its actual denominated value. Where does the rest of that 95 cents of value come from?
It turns out these gaps in value between the worth of the ‚Äòtangible‚Äô thing itself and the actual value of the currency as it stands on the market today is just as much conjured up out of thin air as a mere concept as bitcoin‚Äôs perceived value is.
This ‚Äòintangible‚Äô worth that we ascribe to currency, which accounts for the vast majority of the value of all currencies, not just bitcoin, is ultimately what makes money work. Yuval Noah Harari captures this fact very well in Sapiens, where he lays out the case that the value of a given form of money is essentially an indication of trust in that form of money. It is our shared collective trust and belief in a currency that gives it value, not its intrinsic tangible utility or anything else.
Gold holds its value well because we trust that we will all collectively continue to trust it as a store of value forever, predominantly due to its scarcity and lack of centralized control. Fiat currencies hold their value well when they do because people trust that everyone else trusts the currency as well, and that it is deserving of trust. The moment that collective trust collapses, so too does the currency, no matter what its intrinsic ‚Äòtangible‚Äô value.
This is why no fiat currency has ever stood the test of time over a long enough timescale, whereas gold has to date always stood the test of time and retained its value well. Collective trust for gold has never collapsed because of its inherent scarcity and immunity to the vicissitudes fiat currencies must endure at the hands of capricious centralized governing powers, whereas collective trust in every historical fiat currency has inevitably failed to date, and collective trust in many present-day fiat currencies continues to fail as we speak.
With this in mind, bitcoin can arguably be seen as the purest form of money, as its value is entirely predicated on trust in it, and nothing else. It can arguably also be seen as the most trustworthy of currencies, as it was bespoke made by intentional design to exhibit all the best elements of historically trustworthy currencies (e.g. gold), as well as to introduce for the first time a number of characteristics that make it even better than all previously extant currencies.
If people have trusted gold to date as a store of value because of its inherent scarcity and resistance to centralized control and price/supply manipulation, bitcoin does all that and more, and does it all better. Gold‚Äôs scarcity, as illustrated above, is anything but constant, and we‚Äôve more than doubled our world‚Äôs supply of gold in just the last 50 years. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a precisely and publicly known proliferation schedule, and will approach the limit of its supply in just a few more decades.
As a thought exercise, imagine a new fledgling nation called the United States came into formation and decided to create their own fiat currency today. At the same time, bitcoin is introduced as a currency.
Which would you trust? My personal bet would be absolutely, wholly, and unequivocally bitcoin. With the new US currency, I would be effectively required to trust that the US government would act without fail over the entire course of its indefinite existence to practice perfect fiscally responsible habits and not screw up its economy in any dramatic ways. I would also be aware that even under perfect circumstances, the currency would be fundamentally designed to inflate, and consequently my money would continue to lose value over time if I decided to hold and save it.
Furthermore, I would be forced to use an intermediary financial institution such as a bank to hold my money for me, and thereby expose myself to yet another layer of required trust and accompanying risk. I would also be aware that these institutions would almost certainly practice fractional reserve banking to the maximum extent they could get away with it, such that they would be extremely fragile to small perturbations and vulnerable to things like bank runs and runaway systemic banking collapses.
On the other hand, with bitcoin, I wouldn‚Äôt have to trust anyone at all. I would know for certain that my coins wouldn‚Äôt lose their value due to inflation as a consequence of their designed and indelible scarcity. I would also know that as I stored my coins myself, no one else, not even a bank, could actually go and spend 90% of my money, and fail to give it back to me in the event of a bank run. Furthermore, no one could forcibly confiscate my money under any circumstances, as I could always store it in such a way that it could never be retrieved except with my consent. No one would even necessarily be able to know how much money I held, unless I chose to make that information public.
Remember: just 13 years after its inception, the US currency had already suffered fatal runaway inflation and collapsed. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is worth more than ever just 9 years after its inception, and currently boasts a market cap of over $40 billion. Which would you trust?
The other common argument against bitcoin is that it is useless for any real world functions right now besides ransomware and illegal activities, and is therefore worthless because it has no good use cases.
This is a fundamentally flawed argument that can be lobbied against absolutely any new technology or invention, and fails to take into account the natural process of growth and gradual adoption over time. The exact same argument was used against the internet in its early days, and I find this article from Newsweek, published in 1995, particularly illuminating in this regard.
What‚Äôs striking in this is that while everything he said at the time was true, and certainly none of those things were particularly possible back in 1995, it all came to pass eventually. Today, remote workers are a huge part of the global workforce. Online education is booming. Amazon is taking over all of commerce and is larger than any retail store in the world. Print newspapers and magazines are dying left and right, replaced by a proliferation of online news.
The same growth trajectory is how I see bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology at large playing out. If all goes well ‚Äî and there‚Äôs no guarantee it might, everything indeed might fail and all our hopes and dreams might gang aft agley ‚Äî there‚Äôs no reason at all that bitcoin can‚Äôt one day surpass even our wildest imaginations today, just like the internet did before it, and fundamentally rewrite the script for how we interact with money and the world as a whole.
Yes, today, it is far from this goal, but even now, we make progress in pushing forward the utility of bitcoin in every day pragmatic life. Already, it has proved indispensable to myself and hundreds of thousands of people around the world. I pay many of my employees today in bitcoin, even, because several of them live in Eastern Europe where they‚Äôre subject to draconian capital controls.
Were I to send them a wire (as I used to), their banks demand a mountain of documentation detailing every last dollar and hold their money for upwards of half a month before ultimately releasing it to them. Naturally, this is a pain in the ass and highly inefficient, time consuming, and resource intensive for all of us. Bitcoin easily sidesteps all of these issues.
Bitcoin is also dramatically cheaper to use than almost any other form of international money transfer today. Already, for this use case alone, it proves its worth over current dominant international money transfer solutions, such as Western Union. I can transfer money to anyone in the world, in any amount, and have them receive it without moving a finger in just a few minutes. For this privilege, I have to pay just a few cents, no matter how much I‚Äôm sending, instead of a huge proportional percentage, with hefty minimum fees and surcharges.
It‚Äôs also extremely convenient and valuable for a merchant to use, and we had great success implementing it for a trial run at my company Sprayable back in the day. In the past, we‚Äôve suffered from rampant fraud after our site was targeted on a carding forum (a place where people buy and sell and use stolen credit cards). When we were paid in bitcoin, however, these concerns were completely eliminated, as fraud is an impossibility on the bitcoin network with enough confirmations.
This is only the beginning. You don‚Äôt expect a horse to become a world champion racer straight from the womb. It takes time, training, and a fair bit of luck. The same is true of bitcoin and blockchain technology. But just because a horse may not be a world champion just quite yet, it doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt bet on that horse in the long run. If you see potential in that horse, and are willing to wait it out for the long run, go ahead, bet on that horse. One day, it might just take over the world, and if it does, you might just win big.
Okay ‚Äî now that you hopefully have a good grasp of what cryptocurrency is and why it‚Äôs interesting, we can move on to dipping your fingers in getting some.
We can all be honest ‚Äî the reason the vast majority of you are reading this is probably because you‚Äôve heard a lot about just how much money people have made investing in cryptocurrency. Many, if not all of you, are wondering how you, too, can get on the gravy train and start making millions.
This isn‚Äôt necessarily wrong, or inaccurate. This is the reason I first started paying attention to bitcoin. Countless people *have* made shocking amounts of money investing in cryptocurrency. I‚Äôve personally made over $400,000 in less than two years. In fact, bitcoin has already proven to be the best investment in all of recorded history by a shocking margin for those who got in at its most early stages.
Here‚Äôs a story about a completely random Norwegian student who bought 5000 bitcoins for $27 back in 2009. Today, with a single bitcoin pushing past $2700, those 5000 bitcoins are worth over $13.5 million. That‚Äôs a gain of over 500,000X. No other investment in recorded history that I‚Äôve been able to discover has ever come close to touching these sorts of gains.
Even the Dutch tulip bubble, which is classically regarded as one of the first instances of massive speculative market mania, saw increases only on the magnitude of 10‚Äì100X ‚Äî not even remotely close to 100,000X+. And even the most successful of extremely risky angel investments in companies, such as Peter Thiel‚Äôs initial $500,000 seed investment in Facebook, see returns on the scale of 10,000X or so or less ‚Äî Thiel‚Äôs $500,000 investment, had he held it all the way to the present day, would be worth $6.8 billion, or approximately a ~13,500X gain. More incredible than just about anything else, certainly, but still nowhere even near Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise in price.
What‚Äôs also striking is that traditionally, these sorts of ‚Äòangel or seed‚Äô investments in new technologies have been closed off to all but an incredibly well connected inner circle of elite high net-worth individuals and institutions. Peter Thiel, for instance, was only approached to become Facebook‚Äôs first outside investor because he was already incredibly well known within Silicon Valley for having founded and sold PayPal for over a billion dollars. In contrast, with bitcoin, a random student in Norway was able to invest just $27 and make millions.
That said, just as with everything, there‚Äôs survivorship bias here. What you don‚Äôt hear about are the profusion of people who lost their entire fortunes investing in cryptocurrency. While there are a few ways you can beat all the odds and come out vastly ahead in cryptocurrency, there are infinitely more ways you can lose everything you put into it and end up in a much worse place than where you started.
Here, I‚Äôll try to cover the most common ‚Äòmistakes‚Äô people have made. Do keep in mind that this is all entirely my own opinion. Please come to your own conclusions here.
The most common mistake people seem to make is investing solely based on the price alone and its short term historical trajectory, and nothing else. The second mistake is investing in assets that they don‚Äôt actually understand or believe in long term, are not planning to hold for at least 5 years, and will be tempted to sell if the price begins to fall in the short term. The third mistake is believing that they‚Äôve already missed the boat on the most established and successful cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ethereum, and that consequently they should invest in much less established, much more speculative ‚Äòaltcoins‚Äô to achieve truly outsized gains, for no truly good reason besides the fact that the price/market cap for the altcoin is a lot lower than bitcoin‚Äôs, and seems like it has more room to grow. The fourth mistake is day trading, and trying to capitalize on short term market movements. I‚Äôll address each of these in turn, and why I believe them to be mistakes.
On the first mistake ‚Äî I made this mistake myself when I first got into cryptocurrency. I first heard about bitcoin from a friend who was raving that we should all get into it just around the time the price of a single bitcoin reached $100. He had gotten in at $30, and was extremely pleased with his gains.
At the time, it was relatively big news that bitcoin had reached $100. I remember thinking to myself that it was clearly too late to get in, and promptly forgot all about bitcoin.
The next time I heard about bitcoin was in the fall of 2013, when it began its last truly meteoric price rise from $100 all the way up to $1200. This time around, I distinctly remembered thinking I‚Äôd missed the boat back when the price was just $100, and kicked myself for being totally wrong. I resolved to not make the same mistake again, and tried to get in before I missed out again.
I ended up wiring several thousand dollars to an incredibly sketchy Russian exchange, BTC-E.com, to purchase my first few bitcoins at around $1000 apiece. Before I knew it, I was addicted to constantly checking the price, and spent a full 48 hours doing nothing at the height of the November 2013 bubble doing nothing but refreshing BTC-E.com and seeing how my investments were doing.
I ended up making another big mistake here too, and figured that bitcoin had already gone up way too much, and that my best bet was to invest in some smaller altcoins as well. I made this decision after seeing litecoin (LTC) skyrocket from $4 to $40 in just a few days. The buzz at the time was that litecoin would be to silver what bitcoin was to gold. The price seemed incredibly low compared to bitcoin, and this made a superficial sort of sense (meaning, no sense at all), so I decided to jump in. For good measure, I also decided to jump into a few of the other most popular altcoins of the time ‚Äî peercoin (PPC) and namecoin (NMC).
The 2013 cryptocurrency bubble burst just a few days later, brought on by the collapse of Mt Gox, the largest bitcoin trading exchange at the time. It was revealed that Mt Gox had either been hacked or embezzled from, and no longer had any funds left to honor customer withdrawals. As a result, anyone who had decided to keep their bitcoins in Mt Gox at the time instead of withdrawing them to their own wallets ended up losing all their money. How much the price of bitcoin rises doesn‚Äôt mean anything if you lose all your bitcoins, unfortunately.
The price of bitcoin cratered about 80%, falling all the way to about $200, before stabilizing at that price for much of 2014 and 2015. Litecoin, on the other hand, fell from over $45 to about $1, and consequently lost over 97.5% of its value. PPC and NMC suffered so badly that I didn‚Äôt even bother to calculate how much I had lost, because it was basically everything.
This is when I first saw the light, and realized that investing in altcoins that I didn‚Äôt really believe in, and that didn‚Äôt really have any truly compelling reasons they would ever overtake bitcoin or deserve any level of market share, was an incredibly foolish move. It was certainly true that these altcoins did often gain on bitcoin and appreciated far more rapidly in many cases while the bubble held strong, but the moment it began to collapse, the altcoins were the first to go, and often fell all the way to zero.
As a general rule, what goes up can come down, and what goes up particularly quickly is privy to come down just as quickly. This is not to say that things will come down if they go up, but merely that they can, and certainly have before. This is particularly noteworthy today, with ethereum having seen some truly wild gains this year, all the way up from $7 back in December of last year to over $350 presently ‚Äî a gain of 50X in just about half a year. Again, this isn‚Äôt to say ethereum will fall, but merely that it very well might, for any host of reasons, and it‚Äôs very important to keep this fact in mind and not overextend yourself with investments you perceive to be less volatile than they truly are. I‚Äôll get back to this more later.
What I ended up learning was something the smartest people in the investment world had learned a long time ago. Benjamin Graham, the mentor of Warren Buffett, who became the richest man in the world by practicing the principle of value investing, has a pretty wonderful analogy that I think is worth repeating here. You should buy your stocks (or any investment, generally) like you buy your groceries ‚Äî not like you buy your perfume.
What he means by that is that for some reason, people tend to buy stocks when they‚Äôre going up in price, and sell them when they‚Äôre going down. At face value, this makes no sense. We wouldn‚Äôt buy a watermelon when it was $10, and sell it when it was $2. With groceries, it makes intrinsic sense to us to buy watermelons at $2, not $10, but seemingly not so with our investments.
The short term price movements of a stock shouldn‚Äôt concern a long term value investor in the slightest, as a value investor doesn‚Äôt care about what the market has valued the price of a stock at, but rather only about the intrinsic value of the business behind the stock, and its future potential value. Only after coming to a conclusion about the actual value of a company and its future potential value, should an investor then look to what price the market has assigned a stock, in ascertaining whether or not a stock is a good purchase.
In the case of a watermelon, what we intuitively grasp is that there is some fundamental, intrinsic value to the watermelon, and a ‚Äòfair‚Äô price for it. We have a general understanding of what this price should be, and are more than happy to buy watermelons when they are on discount relative to their fair price, and are reticent to do so when they are being sold at a premium to their fair price.
If we decide that a watermelon‚Äôs fair intrinsic value is $6, then we‚Äôd be happy to buy watermelons all day long at $2, and reticent to do so at $10.
With investments, it‚Äôs the same deal. If we decide that Company X is presently worth $100,000 dollars, and that it has strong growth potential in the future, and the market is presently valuing Company X at $50,000, that would probably be a good buy.
On the other hand, if we decide Company X is worth $100,000, and has ambiguous future potential, and the market is presently valuing it at $200,000, it might not be such a good buy.
In a third case, if we decide Company X is worth $100,000 today, and has extremely strong growth potential, and the market is valuing it at $100,000 today, it might still be a good buy to hold and capitalize on that future potential.
In all of these cases, however, a value investor first and foremost must decide, with rigorous analysis and thorough examination, what they believe the fair value of an investment to be, and what degree of future potential it has. Only from there do they then examine what value the market has assigned the investment, in order to ascertain whether or not the investment is a wise one likely to yield good returns. Under no circumstances should one ever buy into a stock without knowing much, or anything at all about the stock, save for the general market sentiment or hype surrounding it, and its short term price movements. Buying a stock merely because it has seen great gains in the past, without any understanding of why it saw those gains and what gains it might expect to see in the future based on fundamental analysis of the stock, is an inordinately risky and foundationally bereft strategy.
If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about value investing at large, I‚Äôd highly recommend The Intelligent Investor, by Benjamin Graham, who again was Warren Buffett‚Äôs personal mentor and a professor of economics at Columbia University. He pioneered a lot of the foundational concepts around value investing, and can give you much better and more nuanced advice than I ever could.
All of this said, while these principles can and should be kept in mind at large for just about any investment, cryptocurrencies are dramatically different from stocks, bonds, or any other sort of traditional investment vehicle. They‚Äôre also so early stage and so volatile that it‚Äôs a near-certainty that a value investor like Benjamin Graham wouldn‚Äôt even dream of labeling such opportunities as investments, rather than speculations (at best, they would be labeled growth investments, but I‚Äôm working with the Buffett philosophy that there is no difference between ‚Äòvalue‚Äô and ‚Äògrowth‚Äô investing, and that good value investing appropriately takes into account growth).
Investments, under this distinction, would be clarified as things that could generally be safely assured not to suffer from dramatic, catastrophic losses in the absence of dramatic, catastrophic situations. Coca-Cola and Walmart might be considered investments. They‚Äôve been around for well over a century and a half century respectively, are massive, mature companies with a healthy track record of stable, non-volatile growth, and show no general signs of turmoil that might portend a sudden collapse in value.
Speculations, on the other hand, are like the Wild West of opportunities. They‚Äôre extremely high risk, extremely volatile, and could on one hand multiply one‚Äôs principal manyfold, and on the other, dissipate it all into thin air. A seed ‚Äòinvestment‚Äô in Facebook, for instance, could be considered a speculation. In the vast majority of cases, such an investment is likely to fail outright and lose all of the money invested. In a few instances, however, that investment just might succeed, and return tens, hundreds, or even thousands of times the principal invested.
It‚Äôs important to note that the mere fact that something is speculative does not necessarily mean it can‚Äôt be a good investment, or that it is merely akin to blind gambling, dependent solely on the luck of the draw. Poker might be a suitable analogy. Poker can be played well or poorly, and skill and calculation lends an incredible degree of advantage to a player‚Äôs odds of success. However, the game still fundamentally deals with an immense degree of unavoidable variation and unknowns, and even the best poker player is guaranteed to lose many of their games, even if they play each one ‚Äòperfectly‚Äô. The goal, simply, is to win more than you lose, and with the right amount of skill, knowledge, and preparation, this is a possible feat in poker.
The same might be said of speculative investments such as those in cryptocurrency. You can and absolutely should do your part to learn as much as possible about this field, and come to your own personal conclusions on its current and future potential value. However, no matter how much research you do and how many calculations you make, there will always be a fundamental and inextricable degree of pure luck involved in determining the ultimate outcome of your speculation. Any number of future events could tip the scales for or against cryptocurrency, or more specifically, any one cryptocurrency, and a number of these will be ‚Äòblack swan‚Äô events that are fundamentally unpredictable in their nature and timing, but in aggregate whole, almost certain to occur.
Just because there is this element of luck, however, does not mean that you necessarily shouldn‚Äôt play the odds, if you so believe with very good reason that those odds are in your favor. What you do have to make sure of, however, is that you have such good reason to believe that those odds are in your favor, and that you don‚Äôt put up more than you can afford to lose, given the odds. The key takeaway and lesson to be learned, again, is to invest, both in speculations and in ‚Äòsafer‚Äô investments, based on firm knowledge of the underlying asset and intrinsic analysis, to the extent possible, and never merely based on price movements.
In the case of bitcoin, my personal belief is that there is enough to justify the possibility of long term gain based on fundamentals and first mover advantage. If everything goes right, I do see a future in which it‚Äôs possible that bitcoin achieves a market cap similar to that of gold‚Äôs, given that so far as I can see, it provides all the benefits gold does, and a host of incredibly valuable advantages on top of those existing benefits. I even see a future where it just might be possible that bitcoin goes even further, and becomes a dominant leading global currency. It‚Äôs also possible that bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain is used to power many future technological innovations, such as smart contracts and even DAOs, and thereby creates and imbues itself with even more value.
At the same time, I also see a million and one ways where bitcoin fails to reach the promised land. Bitcoin has already experienced numerous growing pains, and at the present moment, is suffering most acutely from a huge backlog of transactions that can‚Äôt be fit on the blockchain. This is because blocks are presently limited to 1 MB in size, and can consequently fit only a small fraction of all the transactions that are trying to be propagated over the network. This forces those who want to have their transactions go through to pay inordinately high transaction fees in order to prioritize their transaction over other transactions.
There are already a number of proposed solutions to this issue, such as the implementation of the Lightning Network, but in order to implement these solutions, the majority of bitcoin miners must agree to update their bitcoin software. Many bitcoin miners are reluctant to do so, in large part because high transaction fees are good for miners, at least on a short term basis, as it means they earn far more per each block mined. The implementation of the Lightning Network and other solutions threatens to take away this extra revenue stream. Hence, users of bitcoin and miners of bitcoin find themselves at odds with a very understandable conflict of interest. It‚Äôs unclear as of yet how this will be resolved, though it seems the community is pushing forward towards a resolution, and I‚Äôm of the personal belief that they‚Äôll get there eventually.
Similar problems like this are virtually guaranteed to occur in the future as well, and it‚Äôs simply impossible to predict right now how the bitcoin community might respond to and handle those problems, and if they‚Äôll be successful in doing so.
At the same time, it‚Äôs entirely unclear how governments will respond to bitcoin as it continues to grow, and if they‚Äôll attempt to crack down in a very strong way and prohibit the use of bitcoin, or the creation of bitcoin related service companies, such as exchanges. If exchanges were banned from operating, for instance, it could very well make it very difficult for most people to transact between fiat currencies and bitcoin, and render the latter far less useful than it otherwise might be.
On the flip side, if the world suffers a global financial meltdown on the scale of the Great Depression or something similar again, and fiat currencies start to crater, it very well may be such that governments are forced to resort to accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, if enough people simply flat out refuse to put their stock in fiat. This was exactly what the US government was forced to do just 13 years into their original experiment with Continental currency, when they agreed to promise to back all the currency they issued with hard gold and silver.
These are just a few of countless twists and turns and vicissitudes our much vaunted (and much derided) bitcoin will have to endure before its long journey comes to an end, either six feet under or as an indelible fixture in our global economy. There‚Äôs no telling which way it will go, and one must come to one‚Äôs own conclusion on how much faith and conviction one chooses to place in bitcoin.
That‚Äôs the case as I see it for bitcoin. In the case of most altcoins, however, I don‚Äôt see remotely enough to even begin to justify the possibility of long term gain in the first place. Even with speculations, or perhaps especially with speculations, it‚Äôs incredibly important to thoroughly analyze a given investment opportunity for at least the potential for long term gain and success, and assess the magnitude of that possible gain, and then to weigh that potential versus the likelihood of outright failure of the speculation. With most altcoins, their value over bitcoin or ethereum is far from clear, and generally superficial or minor at best.
Dogecoin is the most pure example of this. Dogecoin offers just about no fundamental innovations over bitcoin, and is in fact a self-deprecating cryptocurrency premised (initially, at least) entirely on poking fun at itself. The name itself is a reference to the doge meme, and offers little to no further justification for its existence.
Despite this fact, Dogecoin‚Äôs market cap is presently valued at over $300 million. Come to your own conclusions here.
Less immediately obvious examples include things like Litecoin. Litecoin, too, offers fundamentally no truly great innovations over bitcoin ‚Äî in short, nothing that bitcoin itself couldn‚Äôt adopt over time. It uses a different hashing algorithm and just adopted Segregated Witness, the same update that bitcoin is debating adopting that would allow the implementation of layer two protocols such as the lightning network, but beyond this, doesn‚Äôt have much in the way of unique differentiation going for it. This said, Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin and previously the Director of Engineering at Coinbase, one of the most well respected and successful bitcoin exchanges, just announced his departure from Coinbase to focus solely on improving Litecoin. It remains to be seen what will come from this endeavor, as Charlie certainly is without question one of the most accomplished and formidable players in the cryptocurrency sphere, but largely litecoin appears to be a small hedge in the slight off chance that bitcoin doesn‚Äôt actually manage to resolve its scaling issues, and begins to catastrophically lose market adoption and faith and crumble into the ground. In a case like that, the notion is that litecoin would be able to quickly take over the ground lost by bitcoin, and become the dominant cryptocurrency.
There are a number of issues with this, however, and a lot of things would have to go right before this occurred. There are several cryptocurrencies, for instance, with ethereum being the most notable, that are already far larger than litecoin, and it would have to be demonstrated that there‚Äôs some reason something like ethereum couldn‚Äôt simply take the place of bitcoin, and that litecoin would have a better shot at doing so than the larger players that already exist in this space.
Litecoin would then have to deal with exactly the same issues bitcoin has faced at scale, and it‚Äôs not clear at all that litecoin would fare any better at resolving such conflicts if ever reaches the same scale as bitcoin presently has.
All of this said, it does seem extremely likely to me that there will inevitably be some true innovation in this space, and that some cryptocurrencies will be able to carve out niches of varying degrees of value. One might even prove to ultimately demonstrate so many more advantages as to overtake bitcoin one day ‚Äî ethereum, for instance, is teetering remarkably close to doing just that, at least in terms of market cap, if not quite yet other markers such as developer activity and transaction volume. The true feat here will be discerning those few new technologies with true fundamental potential and innovative advantage (and an incredible execution strategy) behind them, from the vast swaths of similar looking yet ultimately worthless contenders almost certainly doomed to eventual failure.
Expected value is a useful concept frequently employed in poker that also serves to provide utility here. In short, expected value is a way to decide when an outcome is not certain, but a set of outcomes are probabilistically determinable, if a given action is going to be net positive or net negative, and to what degree.
The simplest example is flipping a coin. This will yield heads 50% of the time, and tails 50% of the time. Expected value of betting on the coin yielding heads, hence, is 0. This is because in any one given flip, the coin has exactly a 50% chance of coming up heads. Hence, if you bet $100 on the coin coming up heads an infinite number of times, your expected gain, or value, from such an action, is to be $0.
Conversely, if you bet at even odds that a six sided dice roll would come up 3 or higher, your expected value would be positive, as you would be correct 2/3 times. Hence, if you repeated this bet an infinite number of times, you would be guaranteed to be earning more money than you lost.
Similarly, if you were able to bet at 1:2 odds (meaning if you bet $100 and win, you get $200) that a coin would yield heads, this would also be very +EV (positive expected value). The coin would still yield heads half the time, but that half of the time, you would earn $200, and the other half of the time, you would only lose $100. Hence, repeating this bet an infinite number of times would allow you to dramatically earn more money than you lost yet again.
There are far too many variables and unknowns to take into consideration with most speculative bets, and cryptocurrency in particular, to be able to hope for anything so nice and clean as an exact mathematical probability of how + or -EV a given bet on a given cryptocurrency might turn out, just as there are far too many unknowns to calculate the precise fundamental present and future potential value of a cryptocurrency for the purpose of value investing analysis, but regardless, holding both principles at large as a general guiding strategy in determining one‚Äôs actions here and elsewhere is a good bet.
Personally, for myself, a quick back of the napkin calculation that I can do to estimate the possible future value of bitcoin is to see what the market has valued all of the gold in the world at, and use this as a rough guiding principle for seeing how much appetite the world currently has for something that can hedge against other currencies and holds similar characteristics to gold as a store of value. I can see that the total value of all the gold in the world is over 8 trillion dollars, and consequently, if bitcoin were to reach that same total valuation, each bitcoin, assuming 21 million eventual bitcoins, would be worth approximately $400,000. Dividing this by bitcoin‚Äôs current value, I can see that there‚Äôs still room for approximately 150X gains. This means that if I truly believe this is a possible outcome for bitcoin, then as long as I believe this outcome has more than a 0.66 percent chance of happening, or 1/150 chances of success, it would be an +EV bet to make.
That said, it‚Äôs extremely important to keep in mind that one doesn‚Äôt get infinite opportunities to keep playing this bet out over and over again. There is only one bitcoin in the world, and we only have one opportunity to play out this exact bet. Given this fact, it‚Äôs important to realize that if this were somehow to actually be a perfectly EV neutral bet, with a possibility of a 150X upside and a 0.66% chance of realizing that upside, it would still mean that we have a 99.33% chance of losing all our money that we place on this bet. It would be extremely foolish, therefore, to invest all our money into such a wildly speculative investment, even if it is technically EV neutral or even slightly EV positive. What might make sense, is to set aside a responsibly proportionate amount of money specifically earmarked for such wildly speculative investments as a part of a holistic investment portfolio, that one is fully willing and able to lose without significant impact to one‚Äôs well-being or quality of life, and to invest that amount of money in a +EV bet like this.
Returning to the question of calculating potential investment upside here, there are countless other ways to make projections on the future potential value of bitcoin, and I encourage you to try to make some depending on your personal beliefs regarding the level of success bitcoin might have, and the ultimate utility it might provide to the world. For instance, if you see bitcoin primarily as a way to simplify making international transactions and cut out inefficiencies there, you might look to see what the overall market size is for a solution that might solve that problem and capture that market. Western Union, as one example, is a company with a market cap of $9 billion. Consequently, it might be reasonable to expect that bitcoin‚Äôs true ultimate value would be something roughly in that order of magnitude, if this were to be bitcoin‚Äôs one true long term use case.
If you see bitcoin as most useful for its blockchain, you might calculate hence the value you think can be created through applications, contracts, and other technological innovations run on the blockchain, and use that to guide your estimation of bitcoin‚Äôs value.
If you think bitcoin will be used to primarily enable black market transactions, same deal. And so on.
I hope that this elucidation provides some insight into why I personally see it as suspect to invest in something based on price alone, and why I urge extreme caution particularly if one is exploring whether or not to invest in an altcoin, especially if one is at least partially motivated to do so because of the feeling that the ship has already sailed for bitcoin, and that there might be better potential for outsized gains with a smaller altcoin. Again, this certainly may be true, and often is true even for altcoins destined for eventual failure in the short term while a bubble/bull market continues, but risks are amplified just as much as the opportunity itself when it comes to altcoins, and oftentimes moreso in a bubble than otherwise.
It‚Äôs easy to be swept away in the fervor of a frenetic market, and the fear of missing out can be overwhelming especially when you see altcoins rising by wild amounts overnight, but my personal guiding philosophy is to always try to keep in mind fundamentals to the maximum extent possible, to never invest in anything I don‚Äôt actually understand or see long term value in, and to only invest in things I intend to hold very long term (for at least 5 years), especially in such a volatile market.
Speaking to that last point now (the ‚Äôsecond‚Äô mistake I mentioned at the beginning of this part) I‚Äôm of the personal opinion that it is incredibly important to not only invest solely in things that I truly believe have the real potential to succeed in a big way long term, but to actually commit and hold to that investment, once I make it, no matter what happens with the price short term. If some fundamental fact underlying my investment changes, I can certainly re-evaluate it, but if the price drops 90% or even 95% in the short term for no particular reason except a collapse of a local maximum in price speculation (e.g., a bubble popping), I must never be tempted to sell and try to ‚Äòtime‚Äô the market in any way. Instead, I have to hold that investment with firm conviction in what I believe the eventual price based on fundamentals is worth, regardless of how the market values it in the present moment.
This is critically important precisely for incredibly volatile speculative investments such as cryptocurrency, and plays into the fourth mistake I mentioned above, day trading, as well. More than possibly any other market I‚Äôve seen, short term price movements for cryptocurrencies are oftentimes absolutely mystifying and nothing short of mind boggling. Highly anticipated events, such as halvings in bitcoin‚Äôs reward per block mined, come and go without any real perturbation in price. Other times, things rise when reason seems to suggest they should fall, and fall when they seem to have every reason to rise. For instance, bitcoin‚Äôs price collapsed to $200 after the bubble popped in 2013, and stayed stagnant at those levels, despite massive development in bitcoin infrastructure and significant growth in the adoption and usage of bitcoin over that same period of time.
More recently, the approval or rejection of a bitcoin ETF was widely touted as being the contributing factor to a bitcoin bull run from under $1000 to over $1200. It was speculated that if the ETF were to be rejected, that naturally the price would fall to where it was before the bull run began. Indeed, the moment the ETF was announced as rejected, the price did momentarily fall to almost $1000. However, it just as quickly recovered, and began an inexorable climb all the way up to over $2700, where it stands to this day.
Consequently, with the short term price movements of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being incredibly volatile and oftentimes nothing short of inexplicable, I highly caution anyone against making decisions such as selling their bitcoins on the way down in anticipation of a market crash, so as to either avoid the crash or to buy their coins back at a cheaper price at the bottom of the crash.
This goes hand in hand with mistake number four I mentioned above: day trading. This is absolutely number one the reason I see people who have gotten into bitcoin and cryptocurrency lose their money. If you at almost any point in the history of bitcoin (earlier than say, this month of June), merely bought bitcoin and held it to the present day, you would have made money. However, countless people have actually lost money in bitcoin, and this is because they ended up trading their bitcoin somewhere along the way.
I would venture to say that most people have far more confidence in their ability to predict short term market movements than is actually the case. I‚Äôve seen plenty of instances of people who have thought that they could capitalize on short term volatility on the way up, and essentially ‚Äòbuy the dips and sell the tips‚Äô, and in every single instance I can recall, this strategy eventually fails, and often in a big way. At face value, this seems to make sense. If you think you can time when the dips will occur and when they will end, and similarly when the peaks will occur and when those will end, you can definitely make more profit along the way by selling high and buying low.
However, as I‚Äôve mentioned before, this is far more difficult, if not impossible, to do with cryptocurrency, more than even normal investment vehicles like stocks. I‚Äôve seen people who think that bitcoin has hit a peak and must necessarily stop going up sell, intending to wait until bitcoin falls again to buy in again and make maybe a 20% extra profit, miss out entirely because bitcoin kept going up and never came back down. There are numerous stories of those who bought into bitcoin at $1 or less, but sold well before it ever reached even $10, much less $2500.
With something as speculative as cryptocurrency in the first place, it makes no sense to invest in this space to begin with if your only goal is to make 20% profit. It almost certainly isn‚Äôt worth the risk at that level of gain. Hence, risking losing out on the long term upside of 10X+ that you‚Äôve calculated and come to the conclusion does exist for a gain of less than 1X or .5X in most cases makes little to no sense at all. It only makes sense if it‚Äôs essentially a guaranteed gain with no risk, and that, again, is almost certainly not the case.
Indeed, some market movements are fundamentally unpredictable in their short term timing. Two very vivid examples of this were the collapse of Mt Gox for bitcoin, and the hacking of the DAO for ethereum. Both of these events absolutely cratered the price of bitcoin and ethereum respectively, and both of them were fundamentally unpredictable in their exact timing. These are examples of the black swan events I mentioned that are certain to continue playing a large role in short term price developments for bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies at large, that make it doubly dangerous for those who day trade.
I‚Äôve also seen plenty of people who intend to hold long term, but lose faith when they see their investment crater 30%, 50%, or even 70%. At this point, they lose faith, and decide to sell their investment to at least recoup some of their initial capital, and not lose everything outright. Thus, they end up buying high and selling low, and then having double regret when bitcoin eventually ended up rebounding even higher than the ‚Äòhigh‚Äô they bought at.
This illustrates even more vividly why it‚Äôs incredibly dangerous to invest in anything you don‚Äôt actually believe in, and aren‚Äôt willing to hold, long term. If you aren‚Äôt going to hold something long term, then generally you must believe that while the price will rise in the short term, it will not continue to rise in the long term. If you hold this belief, it generally means that there‚Äôs some reason that you believe what you are investing in won‚Äôt hold true value long term, but that there is enough speculative mania in the short term to make the price go up anyway. The thinking goes that if this is going to be true, you might as well profit from this speculative mania and buy in now, wait for a little bit for the price to rise, and then sell it for short term profit.
The problem with this is that just about everyone else investing in these things is thinking the same thing, and everyone involved is effectively playing the greater fool theory, expecting that they will be smarter than everyone else and be able to time the market better than everyone else, and get out before everyone else does, and before the price eventually collapses. By mere inviolable fact, most people who engage in this form of speculation are guaranteed to lose in a big way. Over enough iterations, the eventual likelihood of loss generally grows to become one, in my opinion, as one must continue to time a market correctly time and time again for this to work. While it may seem like the market will continue being bullish for you to get in and get out before things go south, this is true of every moment in time right up until things go south all at once. Inevitably, at some point, the gravy train will have to derail and explode in a rolling ball of fire.
I know for a fact that I‚Äôm certainly not remotely smart or knowledgeable enough to pull off this kind of short term investment that aims to profit from market sentiment alone, especially not in the turbulent, mercurial waters of cryptocurrency, and that‚Äôs all I can say about this here. On top of this, the existence of black swan events that can crater an entire market unpredictably short term introduces a variable that inherently is just about impossible to predict, and makes short term bets like this even more dangerous.
The most dangerous game of all, then, in my opinion, is day trading in altcoins that one doesn‚Äôt believe in long term. This is basically combining every ‚Äòmistake‚Äô I mention above: trading in something because of short term price movements, not holding it long term, day trading, and speculating in highly risky small cap altcoins. If you manage to survive doing this over any long period of time (5 years+, let‚Äôs say) and end up net profitable (particularly if you end up more profitable than just buying and holding over that same period of time), please do let me know, as I‚Äôd be extremely curious to hear just how you pulled it off.
Going back to my personal story, ultimately the crash from $1200 to $200 for bitcoin was the best thing that could have ever possibly happened to me. At the time, of course, it certainly didn‚Äôt feel that way. It felt like I had made an absolutely stupid, foolish decision, and had lost all my money. In fact, I did make a stupid, foolish decision, but not for the reason I thought at the time. I didn‚Äôt make a stupid, foolish decision because the price had cratered to $200. I made a stupid, foolish decision in deciding to invest in bitcoin and altcoins without actually having done my research and without really knowing anything about them.
Had I actually done my research and believed that it was a fair bet to make that one day bitcoins would be worth far more than even the height of the local maximum bubble at the time, it absolutely could have been the right decision to buy in then, even if it crashed later temporarily to $200. What wasn‚Äôt right was buying in simply because the price was going up and I had a fear of missing out.
The crash proved to be the best thing that could have happened, however, because it gave me time to actually do my research and learn about bitcoin, and have real reasons for believing in it long term, at a point in time where the price was unusually deflated. As a consequence, I was able to buy more bitcoin at the very bottom of the market, around $230 or so, when I became truly convinced of bitcoin‚Äôs long term potential. I was also lucky enough to decide not to sell the bitcoins I had originally purchased for $1000 or so, and ultimately saw even those return 250%+ in profit.
It was at this time, incidentally, that Coinbase, became worried about stagnant growth of their user base, and decided to offer a truly astounding proposition. They offered to pay anyone who referred a new customer to Coinbase $75 if the new customer purchased just $100 in bitcoin. Coinbase took a 1% transaction fee at the time, meaning that for every $100 in bitcoin a person purchased, Coinbase charged $1. In short, Coinbase would pay out $75 for every $1 a new customer paid them.
It didn‚Äôt take a genius to see a clear arbitrage opportunity here, and I wrote up a quick blog post detailing this opportunity and fired out a single Facebook post telling my friends about it. From that post and just a few hours of work, I ended up earning almost 17 bitcoins entirely for free ‚Äî worth over $45,000 today. I had plans to scale this strategy en masse, but singlehandedly ended up killing the program almost as soon as it started, when Coinbase finally came to its senses and realized just how much money it was hemorrhaging here with no hope for eventual recoupment (at the time, the lifetime value of the average customer was only something like $25 to Coinbase ‚Äî a far cry from the $75 they were offering).
Digression aside, that sums up most of the thoughts I have about the primary things to be cautious about when it comes to bitcoin investment. There are a few more practical matters to be extremely cautious about (namely, how you store your cryptocurrency), but I‚Äôll address those in the next part, which will be an actual how-to guide showing actually actionable steps for those interested in getting into bitcoin investment.
The final point to make, then, are a few thoughts on how to correctly invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. I have no truly great pieces of wisdom to offer here, but do have a few ideas that primarily aid in being psychologically being resilient to the short term vicissitudes of cryptocurrency investment.
Once you‚Äôve decided that you truly believe in a cryptocurrency long term, and are willing to commit to it for the long term and hold it no matter what the short term price movements might be, the next step is to decide how much to invest, and when to invest. One might be hesitant, with not bad reason, to invest at an all time high, even if one believes that that all time high will one day be exceeded.
The mere fact that the future potential is still huge doesn‚Äôt necessarily preclude the fact that cryptocurrency may be in a short term bubble, and that prices might crater any day by 30%, 50%, 80%, or even more.
Generally, the strategy suggested to average out such short term volatility for something that one is investing in long term is to practice dollar cost averaging. This preaches that one should set an exact time at regular time intervals to buy an exact amount in fiat currency of the investment one is looking to purchase ‚Äî e.g., $1,000 worth of bitcoin on the 1st of every week, or every month. This means that over time, you‚Äôll be able to take advantage of bitcoin‚Äôs general trajectory upwards, but balance out the relative short term volatile price movements both high and low, such that you experience a more linear growth trajectory over time of your principal.
I think that this is a great strategy, and personally practice it with a few modifications. While I‚Äôll never sell at any price essentially (unlike other investments, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are unique in that they are currencies, and consequently if they succeed, you won‚Äôt have to sell them to gain value from them. You can just use them directly, just as you might US dollars or any other form of currency. In the manner that I use the word sell here however, I mean that I likely won‚Äôt sell at any price under $100,000, as that‚Äôs where I personally see the moonshot value of bitcoin going towards, in the slight chance that it does succeed), no matter how high the price rises in the short term, if and when the price becomes particularly low as a result of a cratering market, I will look to buy more than I normally would, to double down on my investment here ‚Äî all the while keeping in mind never to invest more than I‚Äôm perfectly willing to lose entirely.
Psychologically, if it‚Äôs helpful, I think it may be fine to sell off some small portion of your upside if you do realize upside over time, in order to recoup your initially invested principal. I don‚Äôt think that this is necessarily the most optimal actual move to make, but do think it likely makes a huge difference psychologically, such that it makes it far easier for you to hold your remaining investment with sangfroid in the case that it ends up cratering sometime in the future.
As for investing an initial lump sum to begin getting exposure in this space, my personal strategy would be to do a semi-timed dollar cost average, if one is particularly concerned that they might be investing just before a local minimum market crash, but also particularly concerned that the price may keep rapidly appreciating ad infinitum, and would like to get in before that happens. That is, I‚Äôd decide the total lump sum I‚Äôd be willing to set aside to invest here, say, $10,000, and invest 33% or 50% of it immediately. Then, if the market did crash, I‚Äôd be psychologically very happy, and be super excited to invest another 33% or 50%. On the flip side, if the market continued to rise indefinitely and never fell again, I‚Äôd also be happy that at least I was able to get exposure to the market and didn‚Äôt miss out entirely. A 33‚Äì33‚Äì33 split would allow me to invest 3 times when I felt the market was at a particularly good time for investment, and a 50‚Äì50 split twice. Just random arbitrary examples of divisions I might do here, depending on how exactly wary I feel about the market at the present moment in time.
That about sums up my thoughts on cryptocurrency investment at large. There are some nuances, but I figure 8000+ words worth of a brain dump is a good enough place to start. If you‚Äôre still here, please feel free to read on to Part III if your constitution allows for further word consumption.
The shortest section by far. If you made it this far, you deserve to just be able to buy your crypto and be done with it all. I‚Äôll try to make that as easy as possible. There are still quite a few bases to cover, however.
Note: The following bit about exchanges to use holds true for those in the United States. For those based elsewhere, you‚Äôll need to do your own research on the best exchanges to use in your country. The rest of this post should hold the same for everyone in the world, however.
The easiest way to invest is to sign up at Coinbase.com. If you sign up with a referral code, you get $10 when you purchase $100 in bitcoin or ether. I‚Äôve linked my mom‚Äôs referral code here if anyone is interested. Straight to her retirement fund! (In the interest of having zero monetary gain from my fiduciary advice, however, just email me if you use this link and buy over $100 of bitcoin, and I‚Äôll send you the whole $10 my mom receives on her end as a referrer ‚Äî so you get $20 for investing $100. Not bad! ‚ÜíSORRY NEVER MIND I‚ÄôVE BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH THESE MESSAGES AND CAN‚ÄôT KEEP MANUALLY DOING THIS, but you‚Äôre still welcome to use the code and get a free $10 and give my mom a free $10 too!)
However, this is not the cheapest way to invest. That‚Äôs GDAX.com (no referral bonus with this, though). Thankfully, GDAX.com is the same company as Coinbase, and utilizes the same login. Once you make your Coinbase account, you can just login with it to GDAX.com.
At GDAX.com, which is Coinbase‚Äôs exchange, you‚Äôre able to get trades in for either 0% as a market maker (meaning you limit buy or sell and set your own price and ‚Äòmake‚Äô the market), or 0.25% as a market taker (meaning you just buy or sell at whatever price the market is currently at with a market buy).
You can trade immediately as much as you want by sending a wire (only applicable for US customers) to your account following their deposit instructions. There‚Äôs a $10 fee for this that GDAX charges, on top of whatever your bank charges to send wire transactions. This is the fastest method to deposit any amount of money you want and trade immediately with no limits, but not the cheapest.
You can alternatively conduct ACH withdrawals from your bank as well by going to the Coinbase accounts page, clicking on your ‚ÄúUSD Wallet‚Äù, and clicking the Deposit button in the top right hand corner. These are completely free, but take anywhere from four business days to a week to complete.
You can even use a credit card to buy straight from Coinbase.com, but fees here are very hefty. Use as a last resort.
Keep in mind that while you can put however much money you want into GDAX at any point in time, you are generally limited to withdrawing $10,000 per 24 hour period. Thus, if you are buying a large amount of say, Ethereum to send to a token sale address, keep in mind that if you want to send over $10,000, you‚Äôll need to purchase that amount and withdraw it well in advance of the token sale.
For instance, if you wanted to send $100,000 of ethereum somewhere, you‚Äôd need to buy all that ethereum and withdraw over the course of 10 days (assuming you withdrew perfectly each day every 24 hours ‚Äî realistically more like 11‚Äì14 days) back to Coinbase or your personal ethereum wallet before you could then send that ethereum on to somewhere else all at one time, like you would need to do in a token sale.
On GDAX, you can buy bitcoin, ethereum, or litecoin.
From there, if you‚Äôd like to buy any alternative currencies, you can use your bitcoin or ethereum on Shapeshift.io without any account to instantly transfer your bitcoin or ethereum to any other cryptocurrency under the sun, essentially.
To buy/sell on Coinbase or GDAX, you need no wallet, as Coinbase/GDAX will keep your coins for you. You‚Äôll want to enable Google Authenticator for two factor authentication and keep your passwords and your phone incredibly secure, however, as if someone hacks your account, all your money is gone for good with no recourse. This happens a lot. Use a super strong password that you have not used elsewhere and that no one knows and that you won‚Äôt forget.
Ideally, you‚Äôll keep the coins yourself on your own hardware device, which is ultra secure. I recommend Trezor.io (as of this writing, they‚Äôve just run out of stock, but are only backordered a few days if you‚Äôre willing to pay a premium) for this purpose. Ledger Nano S is also good and cheaper to boot, but I personally haven‚Äôt used it and it‚Äôs very backordered in sales. I can recommend Trezor 100% wholeheartedly, however.
Trezor will keep your coins safe because the device itself is immune to hacking by design, and never exposes your private keys (the passwords to your accounts, essentially), even if your computer is infected by malware and is logging all your typing/passwords, or is specifically scanning for private keys, or is engaging in any other form of sneaky bad behavior.
It does this by signing all transactions on the device itself using your private key, and only transmitting the signature to your computer, and never your private key. As a general rule, this is very good, because a good rule of thumb is to never expose your private keys to the internet, under the assumption that the internet is inherently insecure, and if you ever have your private keys interact in any direct way with a computer that has been connected to the internet, you should consider the addresses those private keys correspond to to be compromised and vulnerable to being hacked.
A Trezor also allows you to set multiple passwords that open secret vaults to different wallets on your device, such that even if in some crazy scenario someone just kidnaps you and threatens to beat you with a wrench until you give them your coins (not too crazy actually ‚Äî I‚Äôve been abducted before and had to ransom myself for thousands of dollars in Africa), you can just give them a second password to another wallet that holds say $500 in cryptocurrency instead of $10 million, and there‚Äôs no way for them to know that that‚Äôs not all the money you had on your Trezor.
If someone steals your Trezor, they won‚Äôt be able to find your coins either, as they‚Äôre protected by a PIN that only you know (plus a password if you want to use that feature I mentioned above). You can also recover the coins yourself with the recovery seed the Trezor will give you the first time you use it, which you should store in a super safe location like a safe deposit box somewhere. If you don‚Äôt use utilize the password feature, however, keep in mind that anyone who discovers this recovery seed instantly has access to all your coins, and all your other forms of security are for naught. If you enable the password feature, however, they will need your password as well as the recovery seed in able to access your cryptocurrency, which makes it significantly more secure.
A Trezor will give you your own personal wallets for bitcoin, ethereum, dash, zcash, and litecoin, as well as any ERC20 token built on top of ethereum.
Another benefit of holding coins yourself, in a hardware wallet or elsewhere, is that you know that you 100% own all of your money. Exchanges are just like banks, in the sense that you trust them to hold your money for you. If they end up losing that money to hackers or stealing it themselves, you‚Äôre out of luck. This isn‚Äôt just a scary bedtime story ‚Äî countless cryptocurrency exchanges have been embezzled or hacked (an enormous percentage, actually), and hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost.
Moreover, in the event of a hard fork, whereby two blockchains are created, and consequently, two sets of coins that you technically should own, only some exchanges will actually give you access to both sets of coins. Most notably, Coinbase has explicitly stated that they will only give you access to the dominant blockchain that emerges from a hard fork, no matter how much value the market assigns the non-dominant chain. They may or may not give you access to the other coins in the future, but there is no guarantee either way. In any event, with any exchange you are fundamentally agreeing to trust them to give you access to both sets of your coins, even if they say they will. If you own your coins yourself in your own wallet, however, you need to trust no one. You will automatically own both sets of coins by default in the event of any fork.
This, too, is not merely a theoretical matter. Ethereum did indeed hard fork after the DAO hack, and split off into ETH (the current dominant blockchain for ethereum) and ETC (the ‚Äòclassic‚Äô, or original blockchain for ethereum). As of this time, ETC is worth over $20 a coin ‚Äî more, in fact, than all of ethereum was worth before the hack. Had I kept my ethereum on Coinbase or another exchange like it at the time of the hard fork, I personally would have lost 5 figures in ETC (at present values) merely because the exchanges wouldn‚Äôt give me access to these coins that I rightfully owned.
Finally, my personal preference is to avoid keeping all my eggs in one basket. Despite the fact that a hardware wallet like Trezor is technically one of the most secure options for keeping your coins safe with a fair amount of redundancy in recovery options, the fact remains that one day I might somehow lose access to my coins held within Trezor. I might suffer a concussion, for instance, that causes me to forget the password or the PIN required to access the Trezor, or perhaps I lose my Trezor and am unable to locate or decipher my recovery seed.
Because of this, I actually personally keep my cryptocurrency distributed in several reasonably safe baskets. For instance, despite Coinbase being an exchange that fundamentally requires some trust, they are more trustworthy than almost any other exchange on a technical level (their customer service, however, leaves something to be desired), and it is virtually impossible for their coins to be hacked to any significant degree, and all those at risk of being hacked are fully insured. As a consequence, I leave some of my coins with them, merely because in many ways, I trust their technical security measures more than I trust my own. Before GBTC started trading at such an absurd premium, I also kept some of my funds with them, both in part to diversify across multiple platforms to reduce the risk of losing all my coins with one bad black swan event, and also because it was the only immediately easy way to put some of my retirement funds into bitcoin, short of creating a self directed IRA.
Okay ‚Äî so that‚Äôs about it for investing in the dominant cryptocurrencies available today. If you want to invest in other more speculative altcoins, you‚Äôll have to create your own wallets for them, and investigate the best and most secure solution for doing so yourself. This should generally be a good exercise in any case to determine if you meet the bare minimum requirements for responsible investment in a given altcoin.
Congratulations, you‚Äôve made it to the end. That‚Äôs it. Good luck!

And how to make it a habit

Somebody once asked Warren Buffett about his secret to success. Buffett pointed to a stack of books and said,
When I first found this quote of Buffett‚Äôs two years ago, something was wrong.
It was December 2014. I‚Äôd found my dream job. Some days, I would be there, sitting at my dream job, and I would think. My god, what if I‚Äôm still here in 40 years? I don‚Äôt want to die like this...
Something wasn‚Äôt right. I‚Äôd followed the prescription: Good grades. Leadership. Recommendations. College. Dream job. I was a winner. I‚Äôd finished the race. Here I was in the land of dreams. But something was terribly, terribly wrong.
In January of 2015, I found Buffett‚Äôs quote. I decided to read. I was going to read and read and read and never stop until I got some damn answers.
I didn‚Äôt quite make 500 pages a day, but, in these last two years, I‚Äôve read over 400 books, cover to cover. That decision to start reading was one of the most important decisions in my life.
Books gave me the courage to travel. Books gave me the conviction to quit my job. Books gave me role models and heroes and meaning in a world where I had none.
I want to say reading 200 books a year is an amazing thing. But the truth is, it‚Äôs not. Anybody can do it.
All it takes is some simple math and the right tools.
When the average Joe hears the advice ‚ÄúRead 500 pages every day,‚Äù his snap reaction is, ‚ÄúNo way! That‚Äôs impossible!‚Äù
Joe will then go on to make up reasons to justify his belief without doing any deep thinking at all. These might include ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too busy,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not smart enough,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBooks just aren‚Äôt for me.‚Äù
But what if we go a little deeper? For example, what does it actually take to read 200 books a year? Before I began this project two years ago, I stopped to do the math. Here‚Äôs what I found: Reading 200 books a year isn‚Äôt hard at all.
It‚Äôs just like Buffett says. Anyone can do it, but most people won‚Äôt.
How long does it take to read 200 books a year?
First, let‚Äôs look at two quick statistics:
Now, all we need are some quick calculations...
That‚Äôs all there is to it. To read 200 books, simply spend 417 hours a year reading.
I know, I know. If your brain is like mine, it probably saw ‚Äú417 hours‚Äù and immediately tried to shut off. Most people only work 40 hours a week! How can we possibly read for 417 hours?
I mean, 417 hours sure feels like a lot. But is it, really? Let‚Äôs try to get some more perspective.
Here‚Äôs how much time the average American spends on social media and TV in a year:
Wow. That‚Äôs 3442.5 hours a year spent on TRASH. If those hours were spent reading instead, you could be reading over 1600 books a year!
Here‚Äôs the simple truth behind reading a lot of books: It‚Äôs not that hard. We have all the time we need. The scary part ‚Äî the part we all ignore ‚Äî is that we are too addicted, too weak, and too distracted to do what we all know is important.
All it takes to start reading more is to take ‚Äúempty time‚Äù spent Twitter-stalking celebrities or watching Desperate Housewives and convert some of it to reading time.
The theory is simple. It‚Äôs the execution that‚Äôs hard.
We all know reading is important. We all know we should do more of it. But we don‚Äôt. The main reason this happens is a failure to execute.
I‚Äôm not so perfect at it yet, but here are some tactics that have helped me get results.
If you were quitting cocaine, would you keep it lying around the house? Of course not. Media is designed to be addictive. Moving away from media addiction can be as difficult as quitting drugs.
The biggest bang-for-buck changes here are environmental.
If you want to read, make sure (1) you remove all distractions from your environment and (2) you make books as easy to access as possible.
As an example, here‚Äôs my immediate environment:
I travel a lot. That doesn‚Äôt stop me from reading. The picture on the left is of my ‚Äúbookshelf‚Äù in Thailand. I try to keep books everywhere so I can just pick one up and start reading.
The picture on the right is my smartphone desktop. Notice there are only two apps. One of them ‚Äî the Kindle app ‚Äî is for reading. The other is for habits... Which brings me to my next point.
Willpower is not a good tool for lifestyle change. It always fails you when you need it most. Instead of relying on strength of mind, build a fortress of habits ‚Äî these are what will keep you resilient in tough times.
If you‚Äôre not familiar with habit science, my favorite book on the subject is Tynan‚Äôs Superhuman by Habit. It‚Äôs infinitely practical, and practical is all I care about.
Getting good at habit-forming took me years. Many of the mistakes I made were avoidable. If I could go back, I‚Äôd find a habit coach. Here‚Äôs how I see it. One game-changing idea from a good book is worth thousands of dollars. If a coach helps you read ONE more good book a year, you already get your money‚Äôs worth. (A shout out to Cherry Jeffs and Nathan Sudds, two coaches that have helped me out a lot.)
When it comes to reading, be a jack of all trades, not a specialist.
If your goal is to read more, you can‚Äôt be picky about where you read or what mediums you use. I read paper books. I read on my phone. I listen to audiobooks. And I do these things everywhere ‚Äî on park benches, in buses, on the toilet... wherever I can.
Make your reading opportunistic. If you have a chance, take it. If you don‚Äôt have a chance, find one.
If I hadn‚Äôt started reading, perhaps I‚Äôd still be at my dream job. Perhaps I‚Äôd still be at my desk, taking peeks at the clock and wondering if that was how I was going to die.
If you‚Äôre in a similar position, give reading a try. You may find much, much more than you were looking for.

Alex Birsan|60K|7|https://medium.freecodecamp.org/messing-with-the-google-buganizer-system-for-15-600-in-bounties-58f86cc9f9a5?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|How I hacked Google‚Äôs bug tracking system itself for $15,600 in bounties|"Have you ever heard of the Google Issue Tracker? Probably not, unless you‚Äôre a Google employee or a developer who recently reported bugs in Google tools. And neither had I, until I noticed my vulnerability reports were now being handled by opening a new thread there, in addition to the usual email notifications.
So I immediately started trying to break it.
So what exactly is this website? According to the documentation, the Issue Tracker (internally called Buganizer System) is a tool used in-house at Google to track bugs and feature requests during product development. It is available outside of Google for use by external public and partner users who need to collaborate with Google teams on specific projects.
In other words, when someone has an issue with a Google product, it goes in the issue tracker. Makes sense, right? We, as external users, only get to see the tip of the iceberg: A small set of pre-approved categories, and issues where someone at Google explicitly added an external account, such as vulnerability reports. But how much information lies under the surface?
By observing numerical IDs assigned to the latest public threads, we can easily estimate how much usage this tool gets internally. There are about 2000‚Äì3000 issues per hour being opened during the work hours in Mountain View, and only 0.1% of them are public. Seems like a data leak in this system would have a pretty big impact. Let‚Äôs break it!
One of the first things I noticed upon discovering the issue tracker was the ability to participate in discussions by sending emails to a special address, which looks like this:
buganizer-system+componentID+issueID@google.com
(in which componentID is a number representing a category, and issueID is an unique identifier for the thread you are responding to)
This reminded me of a recent finding called the Ticket Trick, which allowed hackers to infiltrate into organizations‚Äô chat systems by leveraging this kind of email system. Considering that this is an @google.com email address, I tried signing up to Google‚Äôs Slack team using it, and the confirmation page I got to looked very promising:
Alas, no email from Slack ever showed up.
The next best thing I could think of was getting a Google account with an @google.com main email address, which would hopefully give me some extra privileges on the Buganizer. Registering such an account from outside Google was not supposed to be allowed:
However, I found a method to bypass this filter: If I signed up with any other fake email address, but failed to confirm the account by clicking on a link received by email, I was allowed to change my email address without any limitations. Using this method, I changed the email of a fresh Google account to buganizer-system+123123+67111111@google.com.
Soon after, I received the confirmation email as a message on the corresponding issue page:
Nice! I clicked the confirmation link, logged in on the Issue Tracker, and ...
I got redirected to the corporate login page. And no, my Google account credentials did not work there. Bummer.
Nevertheless, this account gave me a lot of extra benefits in other places across the internet, including the ability to hitch a ride (for free, maybe?), so it was still a security problem that opened a lot of doors for malicious users.
Accepted: 11 hours | Bounty: $3,133.7 | Priority: P1
Another Issue Tracker feature that caught my eye while getting familiar with the UI is the ability to star items. Starring an issue means you‚Äôre interested in the problem being discussed and you want to receive email notifications whenever someone adds a comment.
The interesting thing I noticed about this functionality was the distinct lack of errors when trying to use it on issues I did not have access to. Access control rules never seemed to be applied on this endpoint, so I logged in to my second account and tried to star a vulnerability report from my main account by replacing the Issue ID in the request. I then saw this message, which means the action had been successful:
Could it be that easy to spy on open Google vulnerabilities? I quickly posted a comment on the issue to see if I my fictional attacker account would get notified about it.
But again, no email ever showed up.
For some reason that I genuinely can‚Äôt remember, I decided to do some further testing on this one. So I got a recent issue ID, and extrapolated a range of a few thousand IDs which should coincide with the latest issues in the database. I then starred them all.
In a matter of minutes, my inbox looked like this:
My first thought when opening the inbox was ‚ÄúJackpot!‚Äù.
However, upon closer inspection, there was nothing particularly interesting going on in those threads. Apparently, I could only eavesdrop on translation-related conversations, where people would debate the best ways to convey the meaning of a phrase in different languages.
I even considered not reporting this for a few hours, hoping I would find a way to escalate the severity. In the end, I realized that the Google security team would probably be interested in finding possible pivot methods and variants, so I sent out the details.
Accepted: 5 hours | Bounty: $5,000 | Priority: P0
When you visit the Issue Tracker as an external user, most of its functionality is stripped away, leaving you with extremely limited privileges. If you want to see all the cool stuff Google employees can do, you can look for API endpoints in the JavaScript files. Some of these functions are disabled completely, others are simply hidden in the interface.
When designing this limited version of the system, someone was nice enough to leave in a method for us remove ourselves from the CCs list, in case we lose interest in an issue or don‚Äôt want to receive emails about it any more. This could be achieved by sending a POST request like this:
However, I noticed some oversights here that led to a huge problem:
I could now see details about every issue in the database by replacing issueIds in the request above. Bingo!
I only tried viewing a few consecutive IDs, then attacked myself from an unrelated account to confirm the severity of this problem.
Yes, I could see details about vulnerability reports, along with everything else hosted on the Buganizer.
Even worse, I could exfiltrate data about multiple tickets in a single request, so monitoring all the internal activity in real time probably wouldn‚Äôt have triggered any rate limiters.
I promptly sent the exploit details to Google, and their security team had the affected endpoint disabled one hour later. Impressive response time!
Accepted: 1 hour | Bounty: $7,500 | Priority: P0
When I first started hunting for this information leak, I assumed it would be the Holy Grail of Google bugs, because it discloses information about every other bug (for example, HackerOne pays a minimum of $10,000 for something similar).
But after finding it, I quickly realized that the impact would be minimized, because all the dangerous vulnerabilities get neutralized within the hour anyway.
I‚Äôm very happy with the extra cash, and looking forward to finding bugs in other Google products.

Elvis Chidera|68K|10|https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-went-from-programming-with-a-feature-phone-to-working-for-an-mit-startup-40ca3be4fa0f?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|How I went from programming with a Nokia feature phone to working for an MIT Startup|"In 2012, I was just a village boy from Nigeria who had nothing but a dream and a Nokia feature (J2ME) phone. Today, I‚Äôm a 19 year old Android developer who has worked on over 50 apps and currently works for an MIT startup. My name is Elvis Chidera and this is my story.
My journey began with my curiosity about how to build a website. Growing up, I spent a lot of time online as I loved downloading games and reading Society Of Robots. I would save for weeks to buy a 10 MB internet bundle for 100 Naira ($0.28), and back in 2012, that could last for a month.
When learning to code, I took the first and simple step of doing a Google search about how to build a website. I got millions of results. Not knowing where to start, I clicked on the first link I saw, which was from W3CSchools.
The article explained that I need to learn some languages (HTML and CSS) to be able to build a website. I checked some other resources to confirm that I actually needed to learn these things. Then I started the W3CSchools HTML and CSS course.
Each day after school I would head over to the website to study. Initially, the code examples and explanations didn‚Äôt make much sense to me. But I kept studying regardless. I referred to various tutorials when I was stuck. This helped me view the problems I encountered from many different angles.
When I was younger, I struggled with my reading and writing skills in school. I was only able to get better at them through continuous practice. So I already had this model in my head: if I continue to practice ‚Äî no matter how long it takes ‚Äî I will ultimately be able to understand these programming languages.
A few months of intensive learning got me acquainted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I was still learning, a friend showed me the movie ‚ÄúThe Social Network.‚Äù And after watching it, I was super motivated to build the next big thing. Thank you, Hollywood.
I had a eureka moment a few days later. The idea was to build a better version of Facebook. At that time, you couldn‚Äôt see your Facebook friends that were online. Also, Facebook was built to connect with people you already knew in real life.
So that was my billion dollar startup idea: build a social network with all the features Facebook didn‚Äôt have. Mark Zuckerberg - I‚Äôm coming for you - or so I thought.
I spent the next few months building a better social network by adding any feature I could even think of using.
I was naively confident that I was going to win.
After completing the project, I did what anybody without an advertising budget would do. I spammed the internet for days and days.
After several days of marketing, reality slapped me hard in the face. I only got 200 users, which I had to keep begging to come back to the site.
I was depressed! A few months of hard work spent in vain. This taught me two important lessons the hard way:
While it‚Äôs okay to be motivated by a project, you also need to know when you‚Äôre headed down a dead end. I spent a few more months trying to see if I could get more people on my site, but retention numbers kept dancing toward 0%, and I eventually gave up on the project.
But I was motivated by the motto of Lewis in Meet the Robinsons, ‚ÄúKeep moving forward.‚Äù
Seeking inspiration for my next project, I reflected on the needs of my local community. This time around, I wanted to build something that people actually needed and are willing to pay for.
I came up with an idea to make text messages cheaper and easier to send to multiple people at a time. This was more like Whatsapp backed by SMS. After speaking to different people about it, I decided this was the next thing to do.
I named the project Xmx Me. It was going to be a J2ME app. This meant I had to learn Java. Looking back in time, I have to admit that it was the biggest challenge I‚Äôd yet encountered. I had to read some tutorials several times to fully understand them.
After completing a few Java courses, I was ready for work. Relentlessly typing one line of code after another, I carefully built the backend with PHP, the frontend with HTML and CSS, and the mobile app with J2ME. The app was coming to life.
But here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt own a laptop. I was building out all of these pieces of my app on my J2ME feature phone.
Wait. What?
You read that right.
At this point in my life, I had never actually programmed on a laptop. I simply couldn‚Äôt afford one. My parents wanted to help me. But it was difficult for them because they had to choose between paying my school fees (and other necessities) versus buying me a laptop.
I hadn‚Äôt used a laptop before, and my only interaction with computers was at cyber cafes. I remember watching some videos about how to use a computer (left click, drag, drop, and other basic stuff) and then walking into a cyber cafe to practice them.
I was lucky that a relative had gifted me a feature phone (The Nokia 2690). This phone changed my life. It‚Äôs what I used to develop Xmx Me, my failed social network, and several other projects.
With nothing but a phone and the will to succeed, hour after hour I typed my code on that tiny keyboard. I was lucky again to have found an app that allowed me to compile my J2ME projects. Yes, building a J2ME app on a J2ME phone is possible.
The SDK was resource hungry, so my battery often died. I would carry on, writing out all my code on paper and try to review it for any syntax errors.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll fail any Java whiteboard coding tests after having done this for so long. :)
After several months, I had the product ready. I was able to convince someone I met on an internet forum to help me pay for the website hosting and the bulk SMS service for a limited number of SMS units.
The app launch went well ‚Äî at least better than my first project. We got some local press, and one of Kenya‚Äôs top blogs even wrote about the app. We grew organically to about 5,000 users.
We were in business. And we were getting transactions a couple of times a day.
With no prior experience running a business, I made some huge mistakes, some of which were:
I was considering selling the App to buy a laptop. Not knowing what to do, I went online to beg. Yes, I was that shameless and hungry. It didn‚Äôt turn out well. Somebody accused of being a scammer, which I eventually resolved. Again, I was inexperienced and I handled the situation poorly.
After borrowing money multiple times to keep the business running, I decided to throw in the towel. Looking back, I think this was a bad decision. With a little more learning and experience, I would have been able to make things better. Maybe I didn‚Äôt see any future in an SMS app. Well, I released a throwback app recently, and many of the users still use it and love it.
I realized that if I was going to be able to afford a computer anytime soon, I would need to work hard for it. So I began saving all the money I could. I cut my daily expenses and lived as simple a life as possible. I asked my relatives for help. I even sold some personal belongings to raise money for the laptop.
Still, it wasn‚Äôt enough. Determined to achieve my goal, I took on a freelance job of building a website so I could earn the remaining sum.
How do you use a feature phone to build a website designed for PC users? Simple: have a Facebook friend who you disturb every night to view your website on his computer and give you feedback. It was cheaper than going to a cyber cafe repeatedly.
I also made heavy use of Ideone which allowed me to run my PHP scripts to see if they work before uploading them.
Well, I finally was able to get that laptop. I can still remember the feeling of joy I had. That smell of plastic when you unbox a brand new cheap computer. I could now work on any project I wanted without feeling restricted because of my phone.
Since J2ME devices were slowly dying out, I eventually switched to building for the Android platform. My Java skills were still relevant there. I just needed to learn some platform-specific things.
The next year in 2015, after high school, I decided to start working to support my family. So I began freelancing. I was always active in local forums and groups, looking for people who wanted help with building an Android app.
Because I didn‚Äôt have a good portfolio, I would build apps for some people before they even paid, without any guarantee that I‚Äôd be paid. I was stung by this approach several times, but it allowed me to build a good enough portfolio.
I would like to share something I wish I knew while I was freelancing:
I worked with several clients from different parts of Nigeria who loved my work. I eventually got a full-time job in Lagos, Nigeria after working with a client remotely.
Then, while going through my news feed, I saw a job advert for an Android developer position at Dot Learn. I looked them up and realized they are an MIT startup working in an education technology field that I was passionate about, and in a market I understood. They had a unique idea: to solve the problem of access to online education by making educational videos that are extremely data-light ‚Äî as low as 1MB for every hour of video.
This was almost unbelievable, and I knew it was key to making education very accessible to a lot of people.
I am very passionate about revolutionizing education in Africa. In fact, I have already built a free (ad-supported) exam prep app called PrepUp that has over 35,000+ installs and was one of the finalists at the West Africa Mobile Awards in 2016. So I wanted to be part of what Dot Learn was building.
So I went through the developer job requirements and I felt I had a chance. But impostor syndrome didn‚Äôt want me to be great.
For days I had conflicting thoughts. Should I apply or not?
Then I realized one thing: I had nothing to lose.
The worst that could happen would be that I got rejected. But I wouldn‚Äôt die. So, I went ahead and applied.
Fingers crossed, I started re-watching several of the videos I had downloaded from MIT OCW. I also spent some nights watching some coding interview solution videos. In the past, I had mostly been hired based on my strong portfolio and previous job experience, but I didn‚Äôt want to be caught off guard if they gave me a coding interview.
Well, long story short: after lots of preparation, answering some difficult questions, a phone interview, and some coding projects, I was accepted.
I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I was ecstatic.
Looking back at it, this was one of my best decisions.
Working at Dotlearn, I have had exponential growth in my career and have met with lots of awesome people from MIT, Harvard, and other great places.
From attending big events like the Techcrunch Battlefield (I ended up missing my flight) to realizing I could rap, it‚Äôs been a fun and exciting experience so far.
I know I‚Äôm just getting started, but the goal of my story is to inspire someone somewhere in a similar situation like me.

Jeff Davidson|33K|8|https://blog.prototypr.io/the-most-important-rule-in-ux-design-that-everyone-breaks-1c1cb188931?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|The Most Important Rule in UX Design that Everyone Breaks|"There is one principle of organization that every human should adhere to, particularly people who design products. Day after day, I see companies break this rule, and it is 100% of the time to their detriment. In this article I will explain what that rule is, and what it means to product and service design. I‚Äôll also raise the possible implications of this phenomenon on organizational management, collaboration, and general performance. The psychological phenomenon I will be discussing in this article is known as Miller‚Äôs Law. Rather than just tell you what Miller‚Äôs Law is, I ask you to take part in this exercise for a more immersive learning lesson.
Read the italicized instructions before starting. Grab a pen and paper. This is an exercise where you will try to recall words you‚Äôve just read, off memory.
Below is a list of 20 words. Read them to comprehension , and try to memorize as many as possible. Try to keep the words ‚Äòin your head‚Äô. Do not write the words. Spend about a minute. After you are done reading, scroll down until you see the word ‚ÄòSTOP‚Äô. Then, read step 2.
STOP < ¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑
Now, use your pen and paper to write down as many words as you can remember from the list. Think hard, but do not scroll back up to view the words. If you scroll up, the experiment is ruined. Give yourself about half a minute...Once you have finished writing the words you tried to recall, scroll back up and check how many you got right.
If you are like the vast majority of human beings, you will have remembered 5‚Äì9 of the words. Hundreds of experiments prove universality of this limitation on memory. When I first discovered this phenomenon, I knew it had huge implications on product design, because of the degree to which this limitation affects day to day tasks. This capacity for keeping ~7 bits of information ‚Äòin the head‚Äô short term, is known as Miller‚Äôs Law.
In 1956 there was a paper written that became one of the most highly cited papers in psychology. Titled, The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information, it was published in 1956 by the cognitive psychologist George A. Miller of Princeton University‚Äôs Department of Psychology in Psychological Review. The crux of the paper suggests that the number of perceptual ‚Äòchunks‚Äô an average human can hold in working memory (a component of short-term memory) is 7 ¬± 2. This is frequently referred to as Miller‚Äôs law. Here is a summary of the article, sourced from wikipedia:
Moreover, the human mind can remember ~7 bits of information when completing a task that requires cognitive effort. This is critical, because humans are constantly performing tasks, and trying to juggle various stimuli in the mind when doing so. One of the key concepts behind Miller‚Äôs Law is ‚Äòchunking‚Äô, which basically means assembling various bits of information into a cohesive gestalt. For example, the word ¬∑ p e n c i l ¬∑ is actually a ‚Äòchunk‚Äô of letters, organized into a perceptual gestalt. If the letters were rearranged ¬∑ c n l i p e ¬∑ it would be six separate chunks of information. Chunking is a critical element of information organization, and is the basis for our UX and organizational rule.
Always organize elements of information in categories no larger than 9, but preferably ~5 chunks.
The more chunks of information you add to an ‚Äòinterface‚Äô, the more difficult it becomes to ‚Äòwork‚Äô, using the information at hand. This is especially critical for first time users, because they haven‚Äôt had the ‚Äòpractice‚Äô needed to encode the interface into long term memory, or, for the behaviour to become habitual. I constantly see this rule being broken by giants like Facebook, Google, and Wordpress. Don‚Äôt even get me started on automobile interface design. The ~5 bit chunk rule also compliments minimalism as a rigorous design philosophy. To expound, due to the limitations of working memory, as a product becomes more feature-full it inevitably becomes more difficult to use, because the user has to manage more information while operating the product. This makes good information design so critical.
Millers Law also highlights the importance of foresight and proper planning in the design process, because as you add more features to a product ‚Äî your interface must be able to accommodate those new features without breaking the visual foundation of what you built. Rebuilding a foundation takes immense time and resources.
Another perceptual phenomenon observed in relation to Miller‚Äôs Law is known as the primacy, and recency effect. These terms are used respectively to describe how we remember items sensed at the beginning and end of an experience, more than ones in the middle. For example, if I were to show you a list of words, you would more likely remember the words at the beginning of the list, and the end. This is also known as the serial position effect. From wikipedia:
This observation raises huge questions in business and design. If people remember more at the beginning and end of an experience, how do we enhance the positives, and mitigate the negatives at these respective times? When does an experience truly begin and end? Should we be organizing more important elements at the beginning and end of lists due to their increased retention? These are all valid questions that UX designers and executives should ask when inventing or developing their product.
Millers Law can be applied to any aspect of your life that involves performing a mildly complex task. By reducing the amount of elements in your reach/access ‚Äî and keeping them organized by relevant chunks not exceeding 9 bits, your brain will be able to remember exactly where things are so you can access its functionality. When lists of items grow too large, they become very difficult to mentally map them, requiring the user to do more cumbersome searching.
The adherence to Miller‚Äôs Law is especially relevant in the light of lean methodologies and recent trends in tech and UX. Users want and need a trial before they purchase something ‚Äî it‚Äôs that simple. If they don‚Äôt experience the value within the first day or week of using it ‚Äî they won‚Äôt buy. Since new users do not have lengthly time to learn where everything is ‚Äî information design needs to be planned and well thought out before development happens.
We live in a world with an exponentially increasing amount of information. By not organizing it properly, or eliminating some completely, it ultimately degrades our ability to complete critical tasks for the purposes of survival (navigation/gaining income). That is why it‚Äôs so useful to omit items, products, and services from your life that aren‚Äôt giving a quality return on investment. This falls in line with the Pareto principle, the idea that 80% of your outcomes comes from 20% of your investments. Are you juggling too many tasks per day to be efficient? Is your team using too many tools to collaborate? Do you have too many members on your team? Are you overloading your new employees with information, leading to confusion?
Millers law teaches us that humans have a finite amount of information they can process, and that information overload will lead to distraction that negatively affects performance. Companies should look for ways to organize information in a way that is much more digestible for their customers and employees. This could be by eliminating tools or applications that are producing cognitive overload, reducing the amount of members on a team, or even organizing your departments based on our knowledge of working memory.
This is especially true in new science of the concept of flow, made famous by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is a word Mihaly coined to describe a state of concentration or ‚Äòabsorption‚Äô with a specific task that humans ultimately find rewarding, pleasurable, and fulfilling. He describes it as an optimal state where we perform at our best and truly live ‚Äòin the moment‚Äô. One sure way to kill flow is by increasing distractions in the workplace. So, do you think that by giving your employees more tools, that it actually enhances performance? Miller‚Äôs Law teaches us time and time again this is not the case. When it comes to completing tasks, less is more.

They all used hidden code to break the law.|"Two hours ago, The New York Times broke the biggest story about Uber yet. Since 2013, Uber has used a sophisticated tool to undermine local law enforcement at every turn.
The program is called Greyball and it works like this:
The end result is that Uber can basically ignore the fact that a city hasn‚Äôt yet approved ride sharing, and start operating there anyway.
Take a moment to let that sink in. Uber is ‚Äî thanks to its superior software ‚Äî essentially above the law.
The way they identify these riders is actually quite genius. Based on the credit cards the police use, Uber can cross-check merchant databases against public servant databases, and figure out who‚Äôs likely a cop, then ‚Äúhell-ban‚Äù them from being able to use Uber.
The police officers are never able to successfully hail a ride, but as far as they know, they‚Äôre just stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time. That‚Äôs how Uber was able to perpetrate this scam for years, until a few Uber engineers with guilty consciences came forward to blow the whistle.
Zenefits is a company that provides software to businesses, then tries to up-sell them on insurance packages.
In 2016, it was revealed that their CEO, Parker Conrad had developed a tool that helped Zenefits agents cheat their way through the licensing process.
With the help of their custom-built browser extension, Zenefits agents were able to skip most of a legally-required 52-hour online course.
Instead of having to pay new hires to spend a week and a half working through this course, they could start selling insurance much sooner.
Conrad resigned shortly after he was found out. The scandal cost the company half of its valuation ‚Äî $2.5 billion ‚Äî and resulted in hundreds of people losing their jobs.
From 2008 to 2015, Volkswagen produced more than 10 million ‚Äúclean diesel‚Äù cars. Many engineers were amazed that diesel engines could produce so much less emissions than standard unleaded cars, and still have such high mileage. Well, their doubts were vindicated in 2014, when researchers discovered that these cars were using ‚Äúdefeat devices.‚Äù
Executives at Volkswagen had ordered their software engineers to figure out a way to trick the Environmental Protection Agency during their emissions tests. They knew that during these tests, regulators would use specific parameters. So they wrote logic that ‚Äî if those parameters were selected ‚Äî the engine would run in a special mode.
This ‚Äúdefeat device‚Äù masked the fact that ‚Äúclean diesel‚Äù Volkwagen engines were actually producing much greater nitrogen-oxide (NOx) emissions than were legally allowed. Up to 40 times the federal limit.
And this stuff causes lung cancer. MIT scientists estimate that these emissions will ultimately cause 60 people to die prematurely. And that‚Äôs just in America.
That‚Äôs right ‚Äî the software these developers wrote kills innocent people.
Volkswagen ultimately paid out a $14.7 billion settlement in 2016.
This will remain one the greatest environmental tragedies of our time ‚Äî all brought on by a few developers who were just following orders.
The world is increasingly dependent on the code that developers create. As such, developers are quickly becoming some of the most powerful people in the world.
Coding is a superpower. With it, you can bend reality to your will. You can make the world a better place. Or you can destroy it.
You may be able to fool the regulators, the police, the judges. You may be able to fool the general public. And you may be able to go on doing this indefinitely without being caught.
But that doesn‚Äôt make it right.
Developers have great power. And they must use this power responsibly.
If you‚Äôre a developer, or working toward becoming one, I strongly recommend you read Bill Sourour‚Äôs article ‚ÄúThe code I‚Äôm still ashamed of.‚Äù
And if someone asks you to build something that is clearly illegal ‚Äî or downright evil ‚Äî go to the press. The developers in all three of these cases could have done this and saved the world a lot of heart ache.
Remember: only YOU can prevent evil code.

Understanding Event Loop in NodeJs|"In our journey of NodeJs so far , we have covered most of the basic of Node.js so it is highly recommended to refer those to set the context right for all you lovely readers:
3. Node.Js Vs PHP : Battle of Supremacy & Survival
Today We will explore one of the most prominent feature of Node i.e Event Loop and how Node manages efficiently without multi-threading.
Yes! you heard it right, Node is single threaded and it is doing magical things with this model. Some of the popular server side technology like PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby & Java Servers all follow Multi-threaded where each client request results in the instantiation of a new thread or even a process, but Node. js, requests are run on the same thread with even shared resources. All Node JS applications uses ‚ÄúSingle Threaded Event Loop Model‚Äù architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients. So Yes NodeJS is single threaded, but this is a half truth, actually it is event-driven and single-threaded with background workers. The main event loop is single-threaded but most of the I/O works run on separate threads, because the I/O APIs in Node.js are asynchronous/non-blocking by design, in order to accommodate the event loop.
NodeJs operate asynchronously and uses the Event-loop mechanism to function let‚Äôs look into the code snippet example below
var sockets = require('websocket.io'),httpServer = sockets.listen(4000);
httpServer.on('onConnection', function (socket) {
console.log('connected......');
httpServer.send('Web socket connected.');
httpServer.on('message', function (data) {
console.log('message received:', data);
});
httpServer.on('close', function () {
console.log('socket closed!');
});
});
Here when sockets.listen(4000) executes, a Web-Socket server is created on a single thread ‚Äî event loop which listens continuously on port 4000. When a web or app client connects to it, it fires the ‚ÄòonConnection‚Äô event which the loop picks up and immediately publishes to the thread pool and is ready to receive the next request and this is the main functionality differentiation between NodeJs based servers and other IIS/ Apache based servers, NodeJs for every connection request do not create a new thread instead it receives all request on single thread and delegates it to be handled by many background workers to do the task as required. Libuv library handles this workers in collaboration with OS kernel. Libuv is the magical library that handles the queueing and processing of asynchronous events utilizing powerful kernel, today most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background. When one of these operations completes, the kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback may be added to the poll queue to eventually be executed.
To better understand we need to get into the details of how event loop works in NodeJs :
As we have earlier covered that event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operation, despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded & by offloads operations to the system kernel whenever possible. lets further get into the details of how event loop functions to clearly understand the Nodejs single threaded concept of handling asynchronous incoming connection requests.
Node has a pool of Thread and you must be scratching your head wondering if Node pushes all those responsibilities down to the kernel then why would a thread pool be needed?‚Äù It‚Äôs so because the kernel doesn‚Äôt support doing everything asynchronously. In those cases Node has to lock a thread for the duration of the operation so it can continue executing the event loop without blocking.
Here is a simplified diagram to explain the mechanical overview of how things run in NodeJs
Fig 1 : Source : https://nodejs.org/
Here every phase follows FIFO stack like queue mechanism to handle callbacks. Each phase is unique , generally, when the event loop enters a given phase, it will perform any operations specific to that phase, then execute callbacks in that phase‚Äôs queue until the queue has been exhausted or the maximum number of callbacks has executed. When the queue has been exhausted or the callback limit is reached, the event loop will move to the next phase, and so on.
We will cover the Event Loop Phases in details with code snippets in our next articles in our series of NodeJS and also will try to understand the nodejs operations with a practical examples.
I would like to end this article on NodeJs with an amazingly compiled Infographics by Vizteck Solutions where it compares Node with Ruby on Rails.
We will deeply compare NodeJs With Rail in our upcoming article till then ..

Tristan Handy|2.7K|12|https://thinkgrowth.org/the-startup-founders-guide-to-analytics-1d2176f20ac1?source=tag_archive---------9---------------------|The Startup Founder‚Äôs Guide to Analytics ‚Äì ThinkGrowth.org|"You need analytics.
I‚Äôm very confident of that, because today, everyone needs analytics. Not just product, not just marketing, not just finance... sales, fulfillment, everyone at a startup needs analytics today. Analytics powers every decision, from the strategic to the tactical, from the board room to your line level employees.
This post is about how to create the analytics competency at your organization. It‚Äôs not about what metrics to track (there are plenty of good posts about that), it‚Äôs about how to actually get your business to produce them. As it turns out, the implementation question ‚Äî How do I build a business that produces actionable data?‚Äîis much harder to answer.
And the answer is changing fast. The analytics ecosystem is moving very quickly, and the options you have at your disposal have changed significantly in the past 24 months. This post reflects recommendations and experience with the data technology of 2017.
I‚Äôve spent the better part of two decades working in analytics. In that time, I‚Äôve seen plenty of things go well, but a lot more go poorly. I spent the early part of my career implementing legacy enterprise BI (ugh). I built Squarespace‚Äôs first analytics competency from 2009‚Äì2010 and raised massive A round with the data. I was then COO of Argyle Social, a social media analytics startup, and subsequently VP Marketing at RJMetrics, a leading BI platform for startups.
Now I spend my days helping startup execs implement analytics as the CEO and Founder of Fishtown Analytics. At Fishtown, we start working with companies who have raised an A round and help them build their internal analytics competency as they grow. We‚Äôve been through the exact process I‚Äôm going to describe in this article with over a dozen companies at this point, including Casper, SeatGeek, and Code Climate.
I‚Äôm going to walk you through, stage by stage, how your startup should be doing analytics. At each stage, my recommendations are going to answer to the question ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the absolute least I can get away with?‚Äù We‚Äôre not here to build castles in the sky; we need answers as cheaply as possible.
Let‚Äôs do it.
At this stage, you have no resources and no time. There are a million things you could be measuring, but you‚Äôre so close to the details of your business that you‚Äôre actually able to make fairly good instinctual decisions. The one thing you need to make sure you are measuring is your product, because it‚Äôs your product metrics that will help you iterate quickly in this critical phase. Everything else can take a back seat.
If you‚Äôre not technical, you may need an engineer to help out with GA and event tracking. This entire exercise shouldn‚Äôt take more than an hour or two, including reading the docs. It‚Äôs worth it to take the time out of building for this.
Everything that is not one of the things above. Do not let someone sell you a data warehouse, a BI platform, a big consulting project, or...yeah, you get it. Stay focused. When you make a commitment to analytics, there is an ongoing cost. Data changes. Business logic changes. Once you start down this road, you can‚Äôt really put the project on pause. Wait to make this investment until later.
There will be many questions that you just can‚Äôt answer yet. That‚Äôs fine (for now).
You‚Äôre growing your team a bit. These people need data to do their jobs. They may or may not be data experts, and you need to make sure that they‚Äôre doing the basic things right.
It‚Äôs still too early for a data warehouse and for SQL-based analytics‚Äîit just takes too much time. You need to spend all of your time doing, not analyzing, and the most straightforward way to do that is to use the built-in reporting capabilities of the various SaaS products you‚Äôre using to run your business. You also shouldn‚Äôt hire a full-time analyst yet. There are more important things to spend your limited funds on at this point.
This is where things get interesting, and where the changes in the past two years really start to become apparent. Once you‚Äôve raised your A round and have 20+ employees you start to have new options.
These options are all driven by one thing: analytics tech is getting better, fast. Previously this type of infrastructure was reserved for much larger companies. Its benefits? More reliable metrics, more flexibility, and a better platform for future growth.
This stage is potentially the most challenging. You still have a relatively small team and few resources, but you‚Äôre being asked to deliver increasingly sophisticated and diverse analytics to the business, and your work can directly impact the success or failure of the company as a whole. No pressure.
It‚Äôs important to make forward progress here while making sure that you continue to lay the groundwork for future phases of your growth. The decisions you make in this phase can cause you to charge straight into a brick wall if you don‚Äôt think hard about the future.
It‚Äôs easy to get carried away with yourself and begin investing in heavy-duty data infrastructure. Don‚Äôt do this. At this stage, major infrastructure investments are still an expensive distraction. Here are some suggestions on how to stay agile:
Avoiding expensive boondoggles will keep you focused on solving real business problems.
This stage is all about creating analytics processes that scale. You need to balance getting answers that you need today with implementing analytics practices that will scale as you continue growing your team.
At 150 employees you‚Äôll probably only have a small team (3‚Äì6) full-time focused on analytics. By the time you have 500 employees you could easily have 30 or more. 3‚Äì6 analysts can operate in a fairly ad-hoc manner, exchanging knowledge (and code) informally. By the time you have 8+ analysts, this begins to break down very quickly.
If you don‚Äôt manage this transition well, you‚Äôll actually perform less well as your team grows: it will take you longer to produce meaningful insights, and your answers will be of lower quality. This is simply a function of non-linear complexity: you‚Äôll have more data being produced and more analysts working with it. In order to combat this, you need processes to keep them working together reliably.
Don‚Äôt accept excuses. Doing analytics right at this level is hard work, and it requires a talented and motivated team that is constantly innovating and improving. Code reviews take time and energy. Analysts aren‚Äôt used to having to test their code. And documentation is painstaking. There will be resistance to doing things this way, especially among your long-term team members who remember the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù. But as complexity increases, you need to evolve your processes to adapt.
These processes will actually make analytics easier, faster, and more reliable, but implementing them will feel like pulling teeth. If you‚Äôre serious about scaling analytics, you‚Äôll push through.
I‚Äôve come to each one of these recommendations after years of doing it myself within companies and now scaling the approach as a consultant. The opportunity to work with a range of similar clients has made it incredibly clear just how rare it is for companies to do this stuff well.
If you take all of the recommendations in this post, you will literally be one of the highest-functioning analytics organizations in the world. Not a bad competitive advantage.

Hardy|98K|21|https://medium.com/thrive-global/want-to-become-a-multi-millionaire-do-these-15-things-immediately-e1e779a6978f?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|Want To Become A Multi-Millionaire? Do These 15 Things Immediately.|"Most people wish their circumstances would magically change for them. They don‚Äôt have the desire to become better themselves so they can proactively improve their own circumstances.
Unlike most people, who simply wait and wish for luck, you can seek to become the kind of person equipped with the skills and abilities to do brilliant things.
You can become the kind of person who does highly influential work. Your work can solve pressing problems, improve people‚Äôs lives, and get noticed by important people who share your work not for your sake, but for theirs! Sharing your work makes them look good because of how great it is.
The quality of who you are as a person, and the work you do, is completely within your control. But you can‚Äôt wish for it to happen. You must become the kind of person who naturally attracts the success you seek.
Here‚Äôs how:
If you don‚Äôt pay for something, you rarely pay attention.
Most people want stuff that‚Äôs free. But if you get something for free, you rarely prize that thing. You rarely take it seriously.
How much do you invest in yourself?
How committed are you to yourself?
If you aren‚Äôt investing in yourself, than you don‚Äôt have any skin in the game of your own life.
If you aren‚Äôt invested in your business, you probably won‚Äôt do high quality work.
If you‚Äôre not invested in your relationships, you‚Äôre probably more focused on what you can get than what you can give.
When it comes to self-improvement, investing 10% of your income on yourself will yield a 100X or more return on that investment. For every dollar you spend on your education, skills, and relationships, you‚Äôll get at least 100 dollars back in returns.
If you want to do something extremely well, you need to surround yourself with the right mentors. Anything that you‚Äôll ever do well will be the result of high quality mentoring. If you suck at something, it‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt received quality mentoring in that thing.
The best mentorships are the ones where you pay your mentor. Often, the more you pay the better, because you‚Äôll take the relationship far more seriously. You won‚Äôt solely be taking in that relationship. You won‚Äôt purely be a consumer. Instead, you‚Äôll be invested, and as such, you‚Äôll listen more carefully. You‚Äôll care more. You‚Äôll be more thoughtful and engaged. There will be higher consequences for not succeeding.
I invested $3,000 to get help writing my first book proposal from a highly successful writer. That $3,000 got me maybe 4 or 5 hours of his time. But in those 4 or 5 hours, he taught me what I needed to know to create an amazing book proposal. He provided me resources that dramatically enhanced and sped up my process. With his help, I was able to get a literary agent and eventually a multi six figure book contract.
Had I been overly concerned about the $3,000, I‚Äôm confident that to this day, I‚Äôd still not have written a book proposal. At the very most, I‚Äôd have written a terrible one. I would not have been as motivated or invested, so I would have been far more likely to procrastinate needed action.
If you don‚Äôt have much money, surely you can afford to buy a book. How much money and time do you spend on entertainment, clothes, or food? It‚Äôs a matter of priority.
It‚Äôs only when you invest in something that you have the motivation to make it happen.
Beyond mentorships, you should invest in education programs such as online courses, books, quality products such as food and sleep.
Your level of success can generally be directly measured by your level of investment. If you‚Äôre not getting the results you want, it‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt invested enough to get those results.
Your number 1 investment must be yourself.
Who you are determines:
Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find when you financially invest yourself in something. You become very committed to that thing. Economists call this sunk cost bias. But you can leverage this to your benefit. If you want to escalate your personal commitment to something, invest heavily in that thing.
Eventually, it will become a point of no return.
You‚Äôll become so fiercely committed that withdrawing will seem ridiculous.
Hence, you‚Äôll need to truly know WHAT you want and WHY (see #14 below). If you don‚Äôt know these things, then over-committing could be a huge and irrational problem.
However, if you are certain about WHO you are/want to be, WHAT you want, and WHY, then you need to invest yourself.
Most people are consumers rather than creators.
They are at work to get their paycheck, not to make a difference.
When left to their own devices, most people consume their time as well. It is only by investing your time that you get a return on that time.
Nearly every second spent on social media is consumed time. You can‚Äôt have that time back. Rather than making your future better, it actually made your future worse. Just like eating bad food, every consumed moment leaves you worse off. Every invested moment leaves you better off.
Entertainment is all well and good. But only when that entertainment is an investment in your relationships or yourself. You‚Äôll know if it was an investment if that entertainment continues to yield returns over and over in your future. That may include positive memories, transformational learning, or deepened relationships.
Even still, life isn‚Äôt purely about being entertained. Education and learning is also key. And although both are essential, education will provide far greater returns in your future.
The world‚Äôs most successful people are intense learners. They are hard readers. They know that what they know determines how well they see the world. They know that what they know determines the quality of relationships they can have and the quality of work they can do.
If you are constantly consuming junk media, how can you possibly expect to create high value work? Your input directly translates to your output. Garbage in, garbage out.
Just as a large majority of your down-time should be spent learning, so should a great deal of your ‚Äúworking‚Äù time.
Wealthy and happy people work to learn. Unsuccessful and unhappy people work primarily for money.
Only 20% of your energy should be spent doing your actual work. The rest should be spent learning, improving yourself, and resting.
It is by ‚Äúsharpening your saw‚Äù that you‚Äôll continue to become a better and more capable person. Thus, as you dedicate large portions of time becoming a better thinker, communicator, and better at your craft, the quality of your work will continue to increase. Eventually, you‚Äôll be able to charge VERY VERY high fees for your work, because no one else can do it like you.
When you prioritize learning and recovery, then during the hours you are actually working, you‚Äôll be in a deep flow state. You won‚Äôt be distracted like most people are when they work. You‚Äôre either 100% on or 100% off. While working, you can get more done in a few hours than most people get done in a number of days.
Your time is spent well because your priorities are clear, you‚Äôre well-rested, and your mind is stimulated.
In our media and information age, there are a million things you could learn. But if you don‚Äôt put that learning into immediate practice, it becomes shallow information.
Information and knowledge are two very different things.
Knowledge and wisdom are also two very different things.
It takes wisdom to determine what you should learn, why you should learn it, and when you should learn it.
Unless you‚Äôre invested, you probably won‚Äôt learn with the intensity needed to maximize that knowledge.
Unless you understand the value of your time, you probably won‚Äôt have the discernment to ignore almost everything while learning that which will bring the highest return.
When you learn something, you should get a return on that learning. Far too many people read books now just to say they‚Äôve read lots of books. If you‚Äôre not applying what you‚Äôre learning, your consuming and wasting your time.
Very few people create true wealth.
Even those who have high incomes are not truly wealthy. Most people‚Äôs lifestyles match their incomes. When they make more, they consume more. In fact, most people make money solely to consume.
Very few people make money to invest that money.
It‚Äôs best to think of your business as only 1/2 of your income equation. You have your business which brings income. Then, you have your investment entity to turn your income into even more money.
Like anything, how well you manage your money is determined by how well mentored you are. If you want to become brilliant with money, invest in education and mentoring.
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The best time to start investing was also in the past. If you haven‚Äôt started yet, don‚Äôt sit and wallow in regret. Tomorrow doesn‚Äôt exist for people who don‚Äôt do something today.
Start today. Get yourself educated. Create a vehicle, or several vehicles, where you put at least 10% of your income. Eventually, your investment vehicle may even start producing more profits for you than your actual business.
Compound interest is a real thing. If you put 10% of your income into your investments over a long enough period of time, you‚Äôll be set. Unlike the majority of high earners out there, you‚Äôll be able to STOP WORKING whenever you want, because your money is making more than enough money for you to comfortably live with.
Most people are only focused on what they can get out of life.
Me, me, me.
However, once you become more consciously awake to the world, your desire will shift from merely receiving to giving.
You‚Äôll realize that it‚Äôs actually far more satisfying to give than to get.Moreover, you‚Äôll be driven by a cause you fully believe in.
The truth is, you really only have 1 of 2 orientations towards people (and life).
Either you are in relationships as TRANSACTIONS, or as TRANSFORMATIONS.
Most people have transactional relationships. They‚Äôre focused only on what they get out of the relationship. It‚Äôs all about furthering their own agenda. It‚Äôs rooted in scarcity. It‚Äôs selfish.
This isn‚Äôt how you get far in relationships and life.
It‚Äôs also how you get stuck in your own small-mindedness.
Transformational relationships, on the other hand, are completely focused on giving and gratitude ‚Äî the hallmarks of abundance. In these relationships, the whole becomes more than the sum of parts. Both parties, in vulnerability and trust, transcend their own small-mindedness and become something more.
At the core, this requires being a giver, not a taker. As Adam Grant has explained in his book, Give and Take, when two givers come together, the results are astronomical.
Here‚Äôs a pro-tip: don‚Äôt surround yourself with takers.
When your motivation is to give, you‚Äôll often get insights about how you can improve your relationships. Random thoughts will pop into you head to send ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù texts to various people.
You‚Äôll have more ideas about how you can improve other people‚Äôs lives and businesses.
You‚Äôll start contributing more, which will lead to far more opportunities and deeper relationships. People will come to love and trust you. Your work will be motivated by a higher cause and thus will be far more inspired and impactful.
Just because your primary motivation is to give, doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt also seek a lot of help.
Actually, you are constantly seeking and receiving help.
The truth is, everyone is highly dependent on other people to do what they do. But it takes wisdom and humility to openly acknowledge that dependence. Rather than seeing it as a weakness, realize that it‚Äôs a strength.
Beyond acknowledging your dependence, constantly express your appreciation to the people in your life. That which you appreciate, appreciates. Relationships are assets that can and should grow bigger and better over time. As the brilliant entrepreneur Michael Fishman has said, ‚ÄúSelf-made is an illusion. There are many people who played divine roles in you having the life that you have today. Be sure to let them know how grateful you are.‚Äù
If you don‚Äôt appreciate and give to your relationships, your relationships will suffer. All relationships are like bank accounts, and if one person is constantly depositing and the other person is constantly withdrawing, eventually all of the resources become depleted.
In such relationships, 1+1=less than 2.
Conversely, in synergistic and healthy relationships, 1+1= far more than 2. When two people are continually giving and receiving, the relational bank account continues to grow and expand, providing several intended and unintended benefits.
For example, I was recently at the gym with my brother. At the beginning of the workout, he was struggling mentally. He wasn‚Äôt adding to my energy and helping my workout become better than if I was alone, but instead, he was sucking my energy and requiring me to exert more energy and effort than if I was alone.
I made him aware of what was happening, and he immediately shifted his emotional posture. He realized how dramatically his mood was impacting me. His motivation shifted from consuming an experience to creating something great.
Our shared mental state heightened, taking us into group flow. Our workout become far superior to anything I could create on my own. Not only that, but we began to engage in inspired conversation. This led to brilliant insights and connections that were relevant to the book I‚Äôm writing.
The amazing workout was the intended outcome of our synergy. The insights for my book were unintended benefits. This can only happen when both parties are actively giving and receiving from the relationship. Where both are focusing on creating rather than consuming. Where both have the primary motivation of helping the other person succeed.
Most people are in a state of competition rather than collaboration.
Collaboration is a much higher level than competition.
Competition is focused on the self. It‚Äôs also very low level thinking, because what you can do on your own is very limited.
People who are competing are grinding. They‚Äôre more focused on winning than creating real solutions.
However, when your thinking becomes expanded, you realize you could do so much more with other people. Collaboration creates unique connections working by yourself never could.
You have skills and knowledge that are awesome in your field. There are other people in different fields who have skills and knowledge completely outside of your current awareness. These people also have assets you don‚Äôt have.
If you want to get 10X or 100X the results of other people in your field, you need to develop strategic ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù partnerships. This generally happens when you devise a plan where your skill sets and assets merge with the skill sets and assets of someone else.
What you can do well, someone else may struggle with. What you struggle with, others can do extremely well.
Who can you partner with that could speed your process?
Who has assets and resources you don‚Äôt?
How could you help these people?
What types of partnerships could you develop, that would allow you to more quickly achieve your goals and help them more quickly achieve theirs?
When you collaborate with other people, 1+1=more than 2. The whole becomes DIFFERENT from the sum of it‚Äôs parts.
This is how TRANSFORMATION occurs. Only those who engage in collaboration actually experience true transformation. People who only work well by themselves are stuck in their own narrow worldview and agendas.
When you merge with others, your ideas and goals change. They become bigger and better. They become DIFFERENT from what you could ever create on your own.
The only way to have these types of partnerships is to think long-term. You must be invested and have skin in the game. It can‚Äôt be transactional. It‚Äôs can‚Äôt be this for that. It must be about something a lot deeper. When it is, you‚Äôll have far more integrity in the work you do. You‚Äôll express greater appreciation. You‚Äôll consistently do the right thing, even if that right thing is difficult and uncomfortable.
Don‚Äôt seek transactional relationships. Only seek long-term TRANSFORMATIONAL relationships.
Look at your current goals.
Why is that your metric for ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù?
Why is that your target?
What would happen if, in all seriousness, you 10X‚Äôd that target?
What if rather than earning $3,000/month, you pursued $30,000/month?
Is that even possible?
Of course it‚Äôs possible. There‚Äôs several people doing it.
The only difference between them and you is their education, relationships, and strategy.
When you set a 10X goal, you‚Äôre required to think very differently about your daily behaviors. You‚Äôre required to be more serious in all aspects of your life. You‚Äôre required to eliminate limiting thinking and consumptive distractions.
Setting a 10X goal will be one of the best things you‚Äôve ever done for yourself. This goal should be created while you are in a peak state. You get into a peak state by doing something powerful, whether that be exercising, learning, or being in a unique environment, such as a foreign country. You can even get into a peak state by being around certain types of people, the ones who inspire you to be the best version of yourself.
Only you know what gets you into a peak and passionate state. So, do whatever it is that gets you there, and then write down your goals. Declare what you‚Äôre going to do. Then write that goal down and visualize it‚Äôs achievement every single day until it becomes your reality.
When you think about this goal, don‚Äôt deviate from the natural flow of ideas that follow.
You can‚Äôt 10X your results by engaging in the same thinking and behaviors you‚Äôre currently performing. Consequently, while thinking about your goal, you‚Äôll also get ideas about what you need to do, realistically, to achieve that goal.
Chances are, you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know. So you‚Äôll need to start really educating yourself about how you could conceivably achieve your goal.You‚Äôll need to get bolder about the work you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôll need to create more, and fail more. Over and over, in fact. Quantity is often the fastest path to quality.
Not only that, but when you think about your 10X goal, you‚Äôll probably have ideas that scare you. When you do work that scares you, you cross a boundary that most people never cross. Scary work is often highly profitable and valuable work.
Marketing is nothing more than applied psychology.
It‚Äôs about connecting with people, persuading them, and helping them.
Many people think marketing is a nasty or immoral thing.
Many ‚Äúartists‚Äù don‚Äôt learn marketing because they don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúsell out.‚Äù They want their work to be pure.
Academics are not better. Their work is not accessible to the common man.
Marketing is nothing more than making your work easier and better to find and use.

Even right now: How did you land on this page? Look at the title of this article. I could have just as easily called it, ‚ÄúAdvice for becoming successful.‚Äù
But would you have clicked on that article?
Probably not.
But you clicked on this one.
Why did you click on this one?
How did you get this far down?
Think about the experience.
Marketing is the ‚ÄúHOW‚Äù to whatever it is you do.
The reason most people aren‚Äôt successful is because they either fear or avoid marketing. For the same reason, most people are bad teachers. They‚Äôre more focused on content than the delivery and design of that content.
But the delivery ‚Äî the HOW ‚Äî is just as important IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT than WHAT you‚Äôre doing or WHY you‚Äôre doing it.
You could have the cure for cancer. But if you don‚Äôt market it well, you‚Äôll never get your cure out there.
You could have the world‚Äôs most important message, or greatest story, but no one will see it if you don‚Äôt promote and package it intelligently.
Founder of the exclusive entrepreneurial coaching platform, Strategic Coach, Dan Sullivan distinguishes between those who are in the ‚ÄúTime-and-Effort Economy‚Äù with those who are in the ‚ÄúResults Economy.‚Äù
If you‚Äôre in the time and effort economy, you are focused on being busy. You actually believe the amount of time and energy you put into something merits praise. Conversely, when you are in the results economy, you are only focused on achieving a specific result.
The bottom line is what matters, and thus, it becomes very important to find the most effective way to get there. This is a key difference between entrepreneurs and employees. As Sullivan says:
Most people don‚Äôt think in terms of results because their security is in a paycheck. However, when you shift your focus from how little you can do to how much you can do, you change how you work.
You start learning ways to accomplish more faster. You take on greater responsibility. You change your environment. And you also realize just how important sleep and rest are to achieving the highest possible results. Hence, you begin to take more and more time off and rest.
When you dedicate 80 percent of your energy to rest and self-improvement, then you have a lot of fodder and a very sharp saw to use during the time you‚Äôre actually working.
You‚Äôre thinking 10X bigger than everyone else. You‚Äôre operating under short timelines and high pressure. You can tax yourself to extremes while you work because you spend lots and lots of time resting and preparing.
The environments you work in should reflect the work you‚Äôre doing.
Doing several types of work in the same environment is ineffective. But people do it all the time. They sit in the same seat and mentally shift from one task to another.
A far better approach is to BATCH your activities and to do those activities in a relevant environment.
For example, when I write a blog post, I work in a quiet library where I have no distractions. Because my environment facilitates quality writing, and because I knew I‚Äôd be writing that day, I write a lot. It‚Äôs easier to write 2‚Äì5 blog posts in one sitting than to try writing one post at a time.
Ari Meisel, author and entrepreneur, batches his activities and alternates his environments to match the work he‚Äôs doing. On days he is recording podcasts, he goes to a studio and records about 5 podcast episodes in a single session.
On other days, he spends his whole day in meetings or on calls. He does this work at his friend‚Äôs apartment because it‚Äôs a much more engaging environment.
He also does a lot of writing, and does that at the SOHO HOUSE in New York City, because it‚Äôs a quiet environment with poor internet connection. The lack of connection stops him from surfing the web and even using his phone, because he has bad reception.
Success and wealth are not all about money.
There are a lot of people who have money and have little ‚Äúcapital‚Äù in the other key areas of their lives.
Money, obviously, is very important. It solves a lot of problems. It‚Äôs speeds processes.
But money is a tool. It‚Äôs a means to an end. For those engaging in work they truly believe in, money is simply a tool for doing more work.
What is your WHY for what you‚Äôre doing or pursuing?
How could you possibly know your why?
More importantly, how could you know your REAL WHY?
It‚Äôs actually quite simple.
But it takes some radical honestly.
There‚Äôs an exercise I‚Äôll walk you through to get to your WHY. And more importantly, once you know your deepest WHY for what you‚Äôre doing, you should operate FROM THAT STATE, not from your lower and base-level reasons.
When trying to understand why you do something, it‚Äôs better to ask ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù questions then ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù questions, because ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù questions tend to put people on the defensive.
Here‚Äôs a solid question you could ask yourself to understand your WHY.
What about ______________ is important to you?
Let‚Äôs say you want to start a business, or get a new cellphone, or go to the gym...
It could be big or small.
But put that thing in there.
What about ‚Äúgoing to the gym‚Äù is important to you?
Then, you just write the first thing that comes to your mind: because I like feeling good.
Then you take your answer, and put it in the same question: What about ______________ is important to you?
So, given the previous answer: What about ‚Äúfeeling good‚Äù is important to you?
A simple way to structure this exercise is shown in the images just below.
So, you want to try to go 7-layers deep. Once you get to layers 5, 6, and 7, you‚Äôre going to have to be really honest with yourself.
Usually, you can answer layers 1‚Äì4 with your head. However, if you‚Äôre being really honest with yourself, and I mean REALLY HONEST, you‚Äôll need to come from your heart to answer layers 5‚Äì7.
It‚Äôs at the deepest levels that you‚Äôll discover your TRUE WHY for what you‚Äôre doing. Even if that something is as simple as getting a new cellphone or going to the gym.
But you want to remind yourself of your DEEPEST WHY when you‚Äôre doing something. And you want to operate from THAT LEVEL, because at your deepest level, you‚Äôll be operating from your heart, not your head. Thus, your performance will be much deeper, more authentic, and powerful.
The stakes will be higher.
Suddenly, you‚Äôre not just going to the gym to ‚Äúfeel good,‚Äù but because you have a higher calling to perform and need to be as healthy as possible to make it happen (or whatever your deepest WHY is).
Your DEEPEST why will almost always expose something very personal about you, and about your fundamental beliefs about life.
You want to be aware of these things, and how/why they drive you to do what you‚Äôre doing.
If you truly go through this exercise in a genuine way, you should get some mental and emotional breakthroughs.
You should discover something about yourself, and why you are the way you are, and why you‚Äôre pursuing the specific things you are.
Know your why.
Then act from the DEEPEST and most powerful WHY you have.
You‚Äôll be far more brilliant at what you do.
In order to be successful, you must believe in something.
You must have a stand.
All successful people and brands have a clear WHY. As Simon Sinek explains in his book, Start With Why, people don‚Äôt buy what you sell, they buy why you sell it.
Apple is a great example. In all of their marketing, they don‚Äôt explain the technicalities of their products, they define and share their core values. They believe technology should be both easy to use and cool.
If you want to be compelling and interesting, you must truly believe in something. You must have a clear stand. That stand becomes your brand. It becomes your trademark. It becomes how you distinguish yourself from others.
When you have a clear stand and brand, you stand out. You are no longer neutral. You believe in something, and are fighting to make a specific change.
As a result, people will either love you or hate you. That‚Äôs what you want. Lukewarm means you have nothing to say. Lukewarm means you‚Äôre trying to appeal to everyone.
The riches are in the niches. Your niche is your audience. They are a small group of people who agree with the stand you‚Äôre trying to make. They are your evangelists.
If you try to appeal to everyone, your message, marketing, and products will be terrible. You won‚Äôt be clear on your why, and neither will anyone else. Thus, you‚Äôll be average like everyone else and your work won‚Äôt stand out.
Only people with firm stands get really really good at marketing. They care enough about their message to get it out there. They realize that the HOW is just as important as the WHAT and WHY.
Are you doing these 15 things?
How aggressively are you doing them?
Do you want to become a multi-millionaire?
Are you ready to think and act bigger?
You‚Äôve got this.
I‚Äôve created a cheat sheet for putting yourself into a PEAK-STATE, immediately. You follow this daily, your life will change very quickly.

Priyesh Patel|31K|5|https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-exactly-is-node-js-ae36e97449f5?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|What exactly is Node.js? ‚Äì freeCodeCamp.org|"Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment. Sounds great, but what does that mean? How does that work?
The Node run-time environment includes everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript.
Node.js came into existence when the original developers of JavaScript extended it from something you could only run in the browser to something you could run on your machine as a standalone application.
Now you can do much more with JavaScript than just making websites interactive.
JavaScript now has the capability to do things that other scripting languages like Python can do.
Both your browser JavaScript and Node.js run on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine. This engine takes your JavaScript code and converts it into a faster machine code. Machine code is low-level code which the computer can run without needing to first interpret it.
Here‚Äôs a formal definition as given on the official Node.js website:
We already discussed the first line of this definition: ‚ÄúNode.js¬Æ is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome‚Äôs V8 JavaScript engine.‚Äù Now let‚Äôs understand the other two lines so we can find out why Node.js is so popular.
I/O refers to input/output. It can be anything ranging from reading/writing local files to making an HTTP request to an API.
I/O takes time and hence blocks other functions.
Consider a scenario where we request a backend database for the details of user1 and user2 and then print them on the screen/console. The response to this request takes time, but both of the user data requests can be carried out independently and at the same time.
In the blocking method, user2's data request is not initiated until user1's data is printed to the screen.
If this was a web server, we would have to start a new thread for every new user. But JavaScript is single-threaded (not really, but it has a single-threaded event loop, which we‚Äôll discuss a bit later). So this would make JavaScript not very well suited for multi-threaded tasks.
That‚Äôs where the non-blocking part comes in.
On the other hand, using a non-blocking request, you can initiate a data request for user2 without waiting for the response to the request for user1. You can initiate both requests in parallel.
This non-blocking I/O eliminates the need for multi-threading since the server can handle multiple requests at the same time.
If you have 26 minutes, watch this excellent video explanation of the Node Event Loop:
Otherwise, here‚Äôs a quick step-by-step explanation of how the JavaScript Event Loop works.
These are libraries built by the awesome community which will solve most of your generic problems. npm (Node package manager) has packages you can use in your apps to make your development faster and efficient.
Require does three things:
Require is a function, and it accepts a parameter ‚Äúpath‚Äù and returns module.exports.
A Node module is a reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code.
You can write your own modules and use it in various application. Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
V8 is an open source runtime engine written in C++.
JavaScript -> V8(C++) -> Machine Code
V8 implements a script called ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262. ECMAScript was created by Ecma International to standardize JavaScript.
V8 can run standalone or can be embedded into any C++ application. It has hooks that allow you to write your own C++ code that you can make available to JavaScript.
This essentially lets you add features to JavaScript by embedding V8 into your C++ code so that your C++ code understands more than what the ECMAScript standard otherwise specifies.
Edit: As brought to my attention by Greg Bulmash, there are many different JavaScript runtime engines apart from V8 by Chrome like SpiderMonkey by Mozilla, Chakra by Microsoft, etc. Details of the same can be found on this page.
Something that has happened in our app that we can respond to. There are two types of events in Node.
We have to do this, don‚Äôt we?
Make a file app.js and add the following to it.
Open your node terminal, change the directory to the folder where the file is saved and run node app.js.
Bam ‚Äî you‚Äôve just written Hello World in Node.js.
There are a ton of resources you can use learn more about Node.js, including freeCodeCamp.org.

Ryan Holiday|51K|8|https://medium.com/@RyanHoliday/how-to-digest-books-above-your-level-and-increase-your-intelligence-a11bd134da13?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|How To Digest Books Above Your ‚ÄúLevel‚Äù And Increase Your Intelligence|"The best advice I‚Äôve ever got about reading came from a secretive movie producer and talent manager who‚Äôd sold more than 100 million albums and done more than $1B in box office returns. He said to me one day, ‚ÄúRyan, it‚Äôs not enough that you read a lot. To do great things, you have to read to lead.‚Äù
What he meant was that in an age where almost nobody reads, you can be forgiven for thinking that the simple act of picking up a book is revolutionary. It may be, but it‚Äôs not enough. Reading to lead means pushing yourself‚Äìreading books ‚Äúabove your level.‚Äù
In short, you know the books where the words blur together and you can‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening? Those are the books a leader needs to read. Reading to lead or learn requires that you treat your brain like the muscle that it is‚Äìlifting the subjects with the most tension and weight.
For me, that means pushing ahead into subjects you‚Äôre not familiar with and wresting with them until you can‚Äìshying away from the ‚Äúeasy read.‚Äù It means reading Feynman over Friedman, biographies over business books, and the classics over the contemporary.
It worked wonders for me: at 19, I was a Hollywood executive, I was at 21 I was the director of marketing for a publicly traded company, and at 24 I‚Äôd worked on 5 bestselling books and sold my own to the biggest publisher in the world. I may have been a college drop out but I have had the best teachers in the world: tough books.
My apartment is filled with such books that on paper, I never should have been able to understand. It wasn‚Äôt easy to crack them, but with the secrets below I was able to. And the process starts before you even crack the spine of a new book.
Break out of the School MindsetThe way you learn to read in the classroom is corrupted by the necessity of testing. Tests often have very little to do with proving that you know or care about the material but more about proving that you spent the time reading it. The easiest way to do this is picking obscure things from the text and quizzing you on them: ‚ÄúName this passage‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat were the main characters in Chapter 4?‚Äù We carry these habits with us. Remember: now you‚Äôre reading for you.
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre reading the History of the Peloponnesian War. That there was once a conflict between Corinth and Corcyra is not really worth remembering, even though the proxy fight kicked off the war between Athens and Sparta.
(To write this, I had to look the names up myself, I only recalled that they started with a C)
What you should latch onto is that as the two fought for allied support from Athens, one took the haughty ‚Äúyou owe us a favor‚Äù route and the other alluded to all the benefits that would come from aiding them. Guess who won? Place. Names. Dates. These are unimportant. The lessons matter.
From Seneca:
Forget everything but that message and how to apply it to your life.
Ruin the EndingWhen I start a book, I almost always go straight to Wikipedia (or Amazon or a friend) and ruin the ending. Who cares? Your aim as a reader is to understand WHY something happened, the what is secondary.
You ought to ruin the ending‚Äìor find out the basic assertions of the book‚Äìbecause it frees you up to focus on your two most important tasks:
The first 50 pages of the book shouldn‚Äôt be a discovery process for you; you shouldn‚Äôt be wasting your time figuring out what the author is trying to say with the book.
Instead, your energy needs to be spent on figuring out if he‚Äôs right and how you can benefit from it. Plus if you already know what happens, you can identify all the foreshadowing and the clues the first read through.
Read the ReviewsFind out from the people who have already read it, what they felt was important. From Amazon to the New York Times, read the reviews so you can deduce the cultural significance of the work‚Äìand from what it meant to others. Also by being warned of the major themes you can anticipate them coming and then actually appreciate them as they unfold.
Tip: if you agree with their assessment of the work, go ahead and steal it once you‚Äôve finished. You can‚Äôt copyright an opinion‚Äìthis isn‚Äôt school, this is life.
Read the Intro/Prologe/Notes/ForwardI know, I know. It infuriates me too when what looks like a 200 page book turns out to have 80 pages of translator‚Äôs introduction, but that stuff is important.
Every time I have skipped through it, I‚Äôve had to go back and start over. Read the intro, read all the stuff that comes before the book‚Äìeven read the editors notes at the bottom of the pages. This sets the stage and helps boost your knowledge going into the book.
Remember: you need every advantage you can get to read a book above your level. Don‚Äôt skip stuff intended to add context and color.
Look It UpIf you‚Äôre reading to lead, you‚Äôre going to come across concepts or words you‚Äôre not familiar with. Don‚Äôt pretend like you understand, look it up. I like to use Definr or I use my phone to look stuff up on Wikipedia. With Military History, a sense of the battlefield is often necessary. Wikipedia is a great place to grab maps and to help understand the terrain.
I was once trying to read some books on the Civil War and got stuck. 10 hours of Ken Burn‚Äôs documentaries later, the books were easy to breeze through (see, looking stuff up can be as easy as watching TV) That being said, don‚Äôt get bogged down with the names of the cities or the spelling of names, you‚Äôre looking to grasp the meta-lesson: the conclusions.
Mark PassagesI love Post-It Flags. I mark every passage that interests me, that makes me think, that is important to the book. When I don‚Äôt have them, I just fold the bottom corner of the page. (I actually folded the corner of every page of Heraclitus‚Äô Fragments). If there is something I need to look up, I fold the top corner of the page and return to it later.
I carry a pen with me and write down whatever thoughts / feelings / connections I may have with a passage.
It‚Äôs much better to do it in the moment than to risk losing the contemporaneous inspiration. Don‚Äôt be afraid to tear the book up with tags and notations‚Äìbooks are a cheap. Plus you‚Äôll get more for your money this way.
Go Back ThroughI have the same schedule with every book I read. After a mandatory 1‚Äì2 week waiting period after finishing, I go back through the book with a stack of 4√ó6 index cards. One these cards, I write out‚Äìby hand‚Äìall the passages I have noted as being important.
It might seem strange but it‚Äôs an old tactic used by everyone from Tobias Wolff to Montaigne to Raymond Chandler. (Who once said: ‚ÄúWhen you have to use your energy to put those words down, you are more apt to make them count.‚Äù) Each one of these cards is then assigned a theme and filed in my index card box.
The result of 4‚Äì5 years of doing this? Thousands of cards in dozens of themes‚Äìfrom Love to Education to Jokes to Musings on Death. I return to these pieces of wisdom when I am writing, when I need help or when I am trying to solve a business problem. It has been an immense resource.
Read One Book from Every BibliographyThis is a little rule I try to stick with. In every book I read, I try to find my next one in its footnotes or bibliography. This is how you build a knowledge base in a subject‚Äìit‚Äôs how you trace a subject back to its core.
Just keep a running list through Amazon‚Äôs Wish List service (here is mine). Last month I read a book on Evolutionary Psychology and discovered that I‚Äôd read almost 80% of its sources because I‚Äôd been pulled down the rabbit hole of a predecessor.
Apply and UseYou highlight the passages for a reason. Why type the quotes if you aren‚Äôt going to memorize and use them?
Drop them in conversation. Allude to them in papers, in emails, in letters and in your daily life.
How else do you expect to absorb them?
The more fulfilling an outlet you find for the fruit of your database, the more motivated you will be to fill it. Try adding a line to a report you‚Äôre doing, find solace in them during difficult times or add them to Wikipedia pages. Do something.
I give you Seneca again:
Remember: we read to lead for moral and practical lessons. The point is to take what we‚Äôve read and turn the words, as Seneca says, into works.
Of course, none of this is easy. People always ask me if the books I carry around are for school because they‚Äôre full of notes, flags and folded pages‚Äìwhy would anyone work so hard on something they were doing on their own? Because I enjoy it, because it‚Äôs the only thing that separates me from ignorance.
These are the techniques have allowed me to leap years ahead of my peers. It‚Äôs how you strike out on your own and build strength instead of letting some personal trainer dictate what you can and can‚Äôt be lifting.
It‚Äôs also expensive, I‚Äôve purchased thousands of books and invested hours upon hours of time learning them. But how expensive is going back for an MBA? Or attending TED? I think there is more wisdom in the timeless books of the last 5,000 years than a conference or two‚Äìif you do it right and push yourself.
So try it: Do your research, read diligently without getting bogged down in details, and then work to connect, apply and use. It‚Äôs your job as a leader. And I think you‚Äôll find that you‚Äôre able to read above your supposed ‚Äúlevel‚Äù and that people will follow your example. If you put in the work, books, as the great writer and voracious reader Petrarch once said, will pay you back:
Enjoy the journey.

I‚Äôve read about topics ranging from Buddhism to business, philosophy to physics, and writers ranging from feminists to pick-up artists (and even Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúArt of The Deal.‚Äù) I‚Äôve read old books, new books, books with illustrations and fancy charts, a lot of books from which I got nothing and a handful of books I still love. 90% of this was non-fiction.
Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned in all that reading time ‚Äî and some of my favorite books from my 20‚Äôs.
There are two camps of ‚Äúgood books‚Äù and both of them are rare.
(Writing that offers both, it should be said, is the incredibly rare and precious gem indeed.)
When it comes to choosing between them, as we must, I prefer the former over the latter. I‚Äôm not here to be romanced.
(That being said, some of my favorite ‚Äúgood craft‚Äù writing is by way of essays and/or out of writers such as Barnes, Keegan, and Solnit.)
Here‚Äôs one such excerpt. You obviously don‚Äôt have to read it.
Regardless of which direction you go, though, the truly good book is a thing to cherish.
My least favorite books are what I call ‚Äúbullshit business books‚Äù ‚Äî the theoretical fluff written by people who have never directly done the thing.
The authors have read about others doing the thing, they‚Äôre consultants on the thing, they‚Äôre academics of the thing. They‚Äôre professors, or ‚Äúentrepreneurs‚Äù of nothing, or heads of ‚Äúorganizations,‚Äù and they make it their business to compile all the notes they‚Äôve seen from other people‚Äôs actual businesses and pawn it off as ‚Äúexpertise,‚Äù like some armchair anthropologist reporting on ‚Äúlife in the Congo‚Äù because he visited once, so now he ‚Äúknows.‚Äù
In other words: most of the shit sold in airport book stores.
I read a truly unfortunate number of these books before I got fed up enough to swear them off forever, like dumping that big-talk lover who promises you the moon but just leaves dirty laundry everywhere.
And if you learn only one thing from this post, make it that.
Sure, there are studies about how it makes our brain smarter. And how all the most successful people read voraciously.
And then we get people who are only trying to be successful ‚Äî and maybe even making a business out of talking about ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù‚Äî and they take up reading because they hear it‚Äôs clutch, and then regurgitate it on down the chain.
It disappoints me that we perpetuate this nonsense.
I‚Äôm not saying successful people don‚Äôt read ‚Äî many of them do, I‚Äôm sure, and they might even chalk their success up this, in part. But reading isn‚Äôt the secret to success.
I started and built my own business in late 2015. I had read dozens of books on marketing and entrepreneurship and customer segmentation and sales and product and design and everything else under the sun.
But when it came to decision-making, the biggest impact was just doing it ‚Äî my own experience. At some point, ‚Äúresearch‚Äù is just a distraction from real tasks. And you‚Äôll get a lot farther bumping along on your own without any books than you ever will reading and not actually doing anything else.
Entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk wrote a fantastic piece on this, pointing out:
From books for healing to engineering books to resolve a design question, books are an excellent resource for specific questions
My favorite book last year was The Will To Change (hooks) because I was coming off a breakup. I may not have gotten as much out of it two years ago.
Once you get enough of an answer to act on, stop reading and start doing. Otherwise it becomes, as one cofounder of two companies once put it, ‚Äúan academic exercise.‚Äù
My favorite types of books are autobiographies and memoirs from people I admire ‚Äî with top slots going to Zero to One (Thiel), Big Magic(Gilbert), Fashion is Spinach (Hawes), The Hard Thing About Hard Things(Horowitz), and Man‚Äôs Search for Meaning (Frankl), and honorable mentions going to all of the dozens of autobiographical pieces I‚Äôve read (Vaynerchuk included.)
I‚Äôll take any autobiography over any biography. I want to get to know the person. I want their thought process. I‚Äôll take a firsthand account with mediocre writing over flowery garbage that says nothing any day.
Some of my favorite non-autobiographical pieces are still-solid firsthand thought pieces like Rework (and pretty much any thing else Fried and/or Hansson put out) and The Law of Success (Hill), the latter of which includes a chapter on leadership that is by far one of my favorite pieces on management philosophy.
As an aside: the only few pieces I hold in the same tier as firsthand accounts are well-researched and rich books on the human mind, such as Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience (Csikszentmihalyi) and Blink (Gladwell).
Maybe we‚Äôd eventually like a certain book, but we‚Äôre just ‚Äúnot ready for it,‚Äù or right now‚Äôs not the right time.
A guy I dated once let me borrow his copy of Sartre‚Äôs Nausea but warned me ‚Äúthat might not be where you‚Äôre at right now.‚Äù He was right. I didn‚Äôt finish. Maybe someday it might offer something, but it didn‚Äôt then.
This was also true of philosophy overall. When I first tried to wander in through its unlocked side door in my early 20‚Äôs, I felt like I‚Äôd walked into the middle of a heated debate with big words and no context ‚Äî and philosophy isn‚Äôt a conversation where many are willing to pause to get you up to speed.
But when I came back to philosophy a few years later, with very specific questions I wanted answers, I had a much more fruitful experience.
Writers are people. Be careful what you read.
No matter your viewpoints, you can find a writer who agrees. There are feminist writers, there are man-hating writers, and there are self-sabotaging writers who use big words like ‚Äústrong women‚Äù while simultaneously cutting themselves down with the task of ‚Äúwinning a man.‚Äù
You can find angry writers, sexist writers, delusional writers, depressed writers, writers from all walks of life. So if you‚Äôre looking for someone to make you feel validated, you can.
That doesn‚Äôt make any opinion ‚Äî yours included ‚Äî right. And we have to remember this while reading, especially when we‚Äôre looking for ‚Äúanswers to questions‚Äù and already have an idea of what answer we want.
Similarly, it might be tempting to forget that any single piece of work is only the viewpoint of a single person. It‚Äôs not everything ‚Äî only their lived experience (or, at worst, what they‚Äôre trying to sell you regarding yours.)
One person‚Äôs bargain bin find is another person‚Äôs salvation.
One of my dear friends became enraptured with Rupi Kaur‚Äôs Milk and Honey,and recommended it to me with that zeal with which we always throw beloved books at other people. I read through half a dozen pieces and, much to the disappointment I could see fill her previously-eager eyes, they just didn‚Äôt do anything for me.
Some of it‚Äôs personality and values and individuality. Some of it‚Äôs just context, and where we‚Äôre at in our journey.
Reading can be an enjoyable escape, if that‚Äôs what we want. It can also be intellectually rewarding ‚Äî but only if approached in a way that supports, rather than distracts us from, our growth.
Because this is always the first question people ask (even after I tell them that reading is personal and it depends on what you‚Äôre looking for, see above.)

I used only self-directed study while working full-time and spending next to nothing.
I wrote those excited words a few months ago as I was getting ready to start my first day at my new job. Come along with me as I share with you my journey of how I got here.
When I first started thinking about becoming a developer, I would read articles like this one with a bit of skepticism. I kept on looking for something in the writer‚Äôs background that made them ‚Äúspecial‚Äù. That made them suited for this job. Something that I didn‚Äôt have.
I have since come to understand that this is not how it works. There aren‚Äôt any ‚Äúspecial‚Äù requirements to becoming a developer. I‚Äôm not going to tell you it‚Äôs easy, because it isn‚Äôt. But the good news is that all the requirements are things that are in everyone‚Äôs reach. You have to be willing to work hard, learn a lot, and be consistent. You need to persist when things get tough. Talk yourself out of the moments of desperation when you feel like you are not cut out for this. That‚Äôs all it takes, and everyone can do these things with a bit of practice.
I started with no related background study. I had no money to spend on expensive courses, no time in my already busy day, and I was already almost middle aged. Everyone‚Äôs circumstances are different, but I learned that if you put your mind to it, you can do it.
On the day I wrote my first line of code, I had never done any programming before or had any contact with it. I had an early career in the restaurant business. Then I got a degree in Music technology, followed by a decade as an ESL teacher in Spain. I wasn‚Äôt even particularly skilled with computers. I did always feel excited by the latest tech ideas. And I considered programmers the modern day superheroes.
I never contemplated doing it myself, though. Partly because I thought coding was some kind of an elite activity. Something for gifted individuals who graduate from top (and expensive) universities. While individuals like this do exist, the majority of developers aren‚Äôt that Hollywood hacker type. Development is far more accessible than I believed.
It all started with an animated conversation with my partner. She was exploring the causes behind the low numbers of women in STEM and especially in tech. She decided to do something about it by becoming a programmer herself. She wanted to be a model for younger girls in our family. And just like that she started learning about it.
That soon excited me too, as we realized that there are plenty of resources available. This wasn‚Äôt some dark art, but a skill that we could learn and master.
Spoiler alert, she also managed a career change from HR and in fact got a developer job a month before I did.
And so, one day we found a children‚Äôs book about programming in a science museum. We went back home, opened Notepad, wrote <h1>Hello World</h1> opened it in the browser and then changed color: red. We were screaming with excitement! What witchcraft was that!
I was hooked. I wanted to make stuff with code, I wanted computers to do things I said!
At that point I had been working with kids for 8 years. This is not going to be the typical part where one talks about a dead-end job that they didn‚Äôt like. Because I loved my teaching job, enjoyed working with kids, and I was comfortable in my workplace. It was gratifying and enjoyable.
But sometimes, even when you love something, you know in your heart that it is time to move on. It was a new phase in my life and I had a new outlook and new aspirations. And above all, I wanted a new challenge. Something that would push me well out of my comfort zone.
This clearly doesn‚Äôt exist. Three of us started around the same time learning to code for a career change: my partner, myself, and a good friend. All three of us are now working in the field, and there is very little in common between our approaches. Each one followed the material and methods that worked for them. If there is one thing in common between us, it is that we simply did not give up, and kept on going. We all put a lot of hard work and persistence.
So instead of the one true path, I‚Äôm going to tell you a bit about my path. It‚Äôs not the only way, it is not the best way. It is what worked for me.
First, I started reading and watching YouTube videos about programming to understand where to begin. Then I started playing around with HTML and CSS. I followed tutorials and coded along to build some basic web pages. This made me see that it was something I really wanted to get into.
I reached out to two of my friends working in the field for tips and advice. Those early words of encouragement and guidance were vital in getting me going and in focusing my mind on a clear goal.
It took some time to sort through all the options and set realistic objectives that would work for me. I needed a swift career change. I had no alternative source of income, which meant maintaining my job until I could do the switch.
I decided that front-end development was the most accessible and in-demand option. I narrowed it down further by focusing on the skills needed for a job in a startup rather than the freelance route.
Then I set a deadline. I did not want this objective to end up on a to-do list I never see again. It was spring of 2017, so I promised myself that the following school course was going to be my last as a teacher. So by September 2018, a little over a year later, I had to be working in the field.
It would be naive to pretend that at this stage I had everything crystal clear and under control. I didn‚Äôt. Certainty is not a luxury you can have while making such a risky career change. There were all kinds of doubts at that point and throughout the process. The key here was persistence. Once I made the decision, I was going to walk this path to see where it led no matter what.
I knew that the only way forward was to study for it. I had full-time employment, so waiting until ‚ÄúI had time‚Äù was never an option. I had to do it while working, or not at all. I was lucky that my partner was learning at the same time. This helped us organize our days to maximize learning time. At first we would do what we called our ‚Äúweekend boot camps‚Äù where we would dedicate the entire weekend to coding. A typical day looked like this:
8:00 am: Wake up, breakfast.8:30 am: Start coding12:30 pm: Go to the gym1:30 pm: Have lunch, then a break3:00/4:00 pm: Continue coding8:00/11:00 pm: Finish for the day
Then my summer holiday came and I made the most of it by turning the ‚Äúweekend boot camp‚Äù into the ‚Äúdaily boot camp‚Äù. I stuck to that schedule assiduously despite the temptation to enjoy the summer and kick back a bit.
September came and I was back to work. I had made a conscious decision to reduce my hours at work. I accepted that I would have less income in exchange for having more time to study. It was also another step to make my commitment to the career change more serious.
It is hard to convey how difficult it was to be away from my code. All I wanted to do was to be back at my computer to finish solving this problem or fixing that layout. But then real life kicks in. The start of a school year always requires a lot of time for preparation and organization. As any teacher will tell you, it also takes up a lot of one‚Äôs personal time too.
That was the moment my mission could have been derailed. Despite my best efforts, I had less and less time to code. I started losing my momentum. I tried to keep it up but there were days when I simply didn‚Äôt have time. Even with the best of intentions and good motivation, life can make things complicated.
However, as you can see from my GitHub activity image, I kept trying. I kept putting in the time, even if it was an hour, even if it was reading an article. I did everything I could not to get to the stage of losing all motivation. When you have left something for long enough, it makes it harder to get back to with every passing day.
Then as December approached, seeing the new year looming and my deadline closer, I rallied again and got organized. I started pushing through, putting in those hours no matter how tired I was and how little time I had. Sometimes I would get up early to code, sometimes I would stay up late.
This meant that my life was pretty much reduced to doing the job that was paying the rent, and studying. And little else. And I basically maintained that rhythm all the way until the day I started packing to move to Madrid. That was in the spring of 2018, several months before my deadline.
Over the 10 months leading to my job offer, I immersed myself in everything code related. The most frequent question I get asked on Twitter is about what resources I used. I‚Äôve written another article that answers this question in-depth. However, here is a brief list of the most important tools and resources.
Courses can only take you so far, so I complemented this with other tools to help me learn and get a job.
You can also check out My Learning Tracker GitHub repo. It has a full list of the resources and paths I used those first ten months.
Surprisingly, for me, this part was not overly complex. I didn‚Äôt send masses of CVs, or spend hours looking for jobs. Instead I opted for being selective and focused.
In the end I entered five interview processes. I got rejected from one, and failed to finish the take-home challenge of another. I completed three, and got three out of three offers. One of these was completely inadequate and unattractive. The other two, arriving almost at the same time, were both very interesting offers. One of them is my current job.
I don‚Äôt mean to sound nonchalant about this. It was an intense time. I still had no idea if my skills were anywhere near being employable or not. I entered processes not even sure if I was going to be laughed at for how little experience I had. It was a nerve-racking time, but it was an exciting and hopeful time too. And when I finally found myself with two actual good offers on the table I was elated and could hardly believe it.
I will always be eternally grateful to the individuals who made these decisions and decided to give me a chance.
The interview process in the two companies was very different. One was a series of video calls to talk to various people at the company. It was a small but well-established company hoping to build a new team of front-end developers. After a few weeks of back and forth, they made me my first real offer.
The other was a young startup in the middle of great growth. After a phone interview I got sent a technical challenge to complete within few days. It involved building a component, making API calls, and showing the correct information. Then came a video chat about the code I wrote. Then I got invited to have a drink with the tech team to find out if we click. After which I got an offer to join as a junior front-end.
In the end I had to choose. Which was a luxury I couldn‚Äôt believe I got. But I knew what I wanted, I took the offer with the startup based on one main point: they seemed to be very clear on the importance of mentorship and giving me guidance to grow and learn. That was the key. And it definitely was the right choice.
And so, on that rainy day in Madrid, after finishing my coffee. I walked into an office in the business area, introduced myself as the new front-end developer, and started my new career.
I hope you enjoyed my story. If you did, you would make me happy if you give it some of those tasty claps. And you could even make my day by sharing it so more people can read it and learn they too can make it. I want to keep writing more of these articles.

I recognized the mentor as the famous, fifty-something ex-CEO of a household-brand Internet company; the mentee, I pieced together, was the twenty-something CEO of an app on my phone that had raised over $70 million in VC cash.
‚ÄúMy leadership team just gave me anonymous feedback,‚Äù Young CEO told Famous CEO. ‚ÄúOne thing they said was that I‚Äôm not open to being questioned.‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you?‚Äù Famous CEO asked.
‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Young CEO insisted. ‚ÄúAfter every conversation with my team and every all-hands, I always ask if there are any questions or concerns.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet me guess,‚Äù Famous CEO said. ‚ÄúNo one ever has any.‚Äù
‚ÄúRight,‚Äù the mentee reflected. ‚ÄúMaybe I should hold office hours where people can raise concerns privately?‚Äù
‚ÄúI used to do that,‚Äù Famous CEO said. ‚ÄúBut here‚Äôs what happens. People come in, they talk to you about some important issue, and you give your thoughts. Then they go back to their teams and say, ‚ÄòThe CEO said ___,‚Äô and they lord your words over colleagues as a weapon. So I stopped doing that.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo what should I do?‚Äù
By this point, the mentee wasn‚Äôt the only one interested in the answer. In my work with CEOs and executive teams around strategic narrative, I often have a similar need‚Äîas anyone does who leads groups‚Äîto quickly take the pulse in the room.
‚ÄúTake notes on this,‚Äù Famous CEO said. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm going to tell you what Steve Jobs did, which was related to me by the late [Apple board member] Bill Campbell.‚Äù
I ordered another crab cake.
‚ÄúIn the early 2000s,‚Äù Famous CEO said, ‚ÄúJobs was splitting his time between Apple and Pixar. He would spend most days at Apple, but then he would parachute into Pixar. He would have to figure out where his attention was needed really fast, so he would arrange sessions with all the different teams‚Äîthe Cars team, the technology team, whatever‚Äîso there were a dozen or so people in each one. Then he would point to one person in each session and say:
Famous CEO continued: ‚ÄúThat person might offer something like, ‚ÄòThe design team isn‚Äôt open to new technology we‚Äôre building.‚Äô Jobs would ask others if they agreed. He would then choose someone else and say:
According to Famous CEO, Jobs would alternate between the two questions until he felt like he had a handle on what was going on.
Famous CEO said he ran sessions like these with his own teams every few months. He advised Young CEO to ‚Äúnever invite VPs‚Äù (i.e., team leaders) to the sessions, since subordinates might feel intimidated and share less freely. Instead, Famous CEO would commit, after collecting issues, to discussing them with the VP in charge, who would be responsible for following up.
A few days later, I led a workshop on strategic narrative design with about 40 CEOs, salespeople, and marketers. Just before it was over, instead of simply asking ‚ÄúAny questions?‚Äù as I normally did (which typically won me a roomful of silence), I called on a woman who, judging from her active participation in the class, seemed like she wouldn‚Äôt mind being singled out.
I asked her this question, inspired by that third-hand Jobs wisdom:
I worded it like this to position any confusion as my failing, not my audience‚Äôs inability to understand. I was also careful not to phrase it as a ‚Äúyes-no‚Äù question (‚ÄúDid I make anything confusing?‚Äù), which might have been more likely to elicit a polite ‚Äúno.‚Äù
The woman said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still confused about how exactly the narrative elements fit together.‚Äù Of course, it was a question that I myself had been wrestling with for decades. My first reaction was to try to explain it to her in some different way, but instead I just said this:
The woman smiled, and her classmates seemed relieved. What I learned that day was how it puts my audiences at ease when I make a point to say how hard this stuff is (very), and how long it usually takes for most people to feel like they‚Äôve landed on the right story (weeks, months, years).
Later, I called on another participant and asked: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the thing you learned today that will most help you outside of this class?‚Äù As you can imagine, it was rewarding to hear about the positive impact I had made.
If you work with teams in any way, I recommend trying Jobs‚Äôs technique, my variation on it, or a variation of your own. And if you‚Äôre at Just For You Cafe, I recommend the crab cakes. They really are very good, even without the complimentary side of Silicon Valley wisdom.

You can find the link to the follow up article at the end of this article.
Everyone is talking about Bitcoin these days, from your barber to your friends working at stock market. Don‚Äôt worry this article is not about several other articles talking about making money from Bitcoin. However, I will try to help you understand the underlying technology which makes Bitcoin work and how this concept of blockchain can be useful in the coming decades.
October 31, 2008, a white paper from an anonymous person or organization named Satoshi Nakamoto was published which explained a novel approach to send money from sender to receiver directly without involving any financial intermediaries. The paper gave a name to this concept ‚Äî Bitcoin. Since, Bitcoin uses some underlying concepts of cryptography, this new way of exchanging money was categorized as cryptocurrency. The only purpose of Bitcoin was for financial transactions but researchers realized that its foundational technology can be harvested to build other secure and robust applications that can revolutionize the way current systems work. ‚ÄúBlockchain‚Äù was the name given to this foundational technology. Lots of technical words? Let‚Äôs simplify!
Let‚Äôs imagine that you live in a city, which has a big parking space to park 200 cars at one time (assume that the parking space just has a ground floor). This parking space has a main gate which stays locked and is only opened when a car moves in or out. Now let‚Äôs analyze this single parking building from different points of view ‚Äî
Now, let‚Äôs modify the current scenario. Imagine that there are 200 houses in your city and all 200 houses have two garages each. However, to simplify our explanation, let‚Äôs assume each house just has one car (all cars filling up all the slots of big parking space described above). So, each house has one empty garage out of the two garages available. Now, let‚Äôs say people of the city decide to rent out the extra garage to anyone who needs a parking. This model of providing parking space will solve the problem of parking 200 cars or more cars (in case people move in and out of the city) without the need of building any central bigger parking space for the entire city. Similar to the previous scenario, let‚Äôs analyze this scenario ‚Äî
The above analogy provides the foundation for understanding the actual technical infrastructure of the Blockchain.
The parking model presents a very basic overview of Blockchain in some real world language. Now, let‚Äôs try to match the components of our parking example to the actual technical model ‚Äî
Wait! We missed something.
All decentralized systems are not Blockchain!! Yes, Blockchain is a particular type of decentralized system that has a unique property. Which property? Let‚Äôs talk about it.
Let‚Äôs revisit our distributed parking example and make a small change. Let‚Äôs assume that the lock to a particular garage is generated when a car is parked inside it (we assume that the same car goes to the same parking everyday). Also, assume that we have numbered all the distributed garages in serial order. The lock-key pair of garage #50 is based on the lock-key pair of garage #49 and also on the features (like color, weight, engine number etc.) of the car parked inside garage #50 and this process starts from garage #1 and moves till garage #200 or even more.
Therefore, if a thief tries to break into garage #49 and modifies any feature of the car, say its color or registration number, the features of car in garage #49 will change which means a new lock-key pair for garage #49 will be generated and since lock-key-pair for garage #50 depends on lock-key pair of garage #49, lock-key pair for garage #50 will also change and same goes on for future garages.
Now, let‚Äôs make one last assumption that computing a lock-key pair requires lots of computing resources which means if we have to recompute these pairs in case any thief modifies any car feature in any garage, it will be practically impossible to recompute all the pairs again.
Hope you remember that we talked about all garage owners abiding by some rules? One of these rules is to check for a valid garage. A garage is valid if you can validate its lock-key pair and if any lock-key pair gets changed, the lock-key pairs of all the following garages get invalid because every pair depends on the previous pair. (Process to validate a lock-key pair for a particular garage is very fast as compared to generating one).
This dependence of one pair on the previous pair makes it a chain of garages and in technical world, these garages are ‚Äúblocks‚Äù, thus getting its name ‚Äî Blockchain (a chain of blocks).
Blocks in Blockchain are tied to the next block by hashes just like lock-key pairs in our example. Similar to garage example, if data in one block is modified, hashes need to be recalculated for all the following blocks and since calculating the hash is a very resource intensive operation, it gets practically impossible to do that and hence the network rules out the invalidated block. The calculation of hash is called mining and we will talk more about it in the next release of this series.
All the computers on the blockchain network, keep a copy of the full blockchain, so if one block or one complete chain at a particular computer or multiple computers is modified, the whole network tries to compare it with their own copies of the full chain.
If majority of the nodes (or computers) on the network find that the modified chain is invalid, the modified chain is replaced with valid chain from other nodes. This makes Blockchain vulnerable to 51% attack. In simpler words, if more than 50% of the nodes on the network are malicious (or say have a modified chain), then the whole network can be compromised.
Phew!! that was a lot of information to digest. This was the part I of the full beginner‚Äôs guide, providing the basic foundation for Blockchain. I hope this article prepared you for some good discussion with your friends regarding Blockchain. Checkout the next release of this series where we talk about Ethereum, Smart Contracts and Mining.

The new building, MK21, designed by Canadian starchitect Frank Gehry, is the pinnacle of today‚Äôs open office design trend.
For years, the open office design was touted as the new and improved workplace architecture.
If the late 90s brought us Office Space style ‚Äî dismal workspaces framed by lifeless, beige cubicle walls ‚Äî the 21st century ushered in bright, airy open-plan offices.
Like unlimited snacks and craft coffee on tap, the open office concept seemed revolutionary ‚Äî bound to improve the quality of an employee‚Äôs work experience.
Aesthetics aside, managers imagined that open offices would increase interactions between colleagues, and enhance cooperation and productivity.
Speaking about Facebook‚Äôs previous office building, MK20, also a Gehry-designed open office, Facebook‚Äôs then Chief People Officer said,
Apparently, even CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a designated place somewhere in the sea of desks. (Kudos to Zuckerberg for practicing what he preaches, if he does, in fact, work in the open office.)
Though the hype associated with open office spaces may make another day at the office seem a lot more appealing, the reality of these transparent offices ‚Äî in terms of employee interaction and productivity ‚Äî is a lot less clear.
The loud talker three desks down; constant taps on the shoulder; the guy who incessantly clicks his pen; the girl who eats a tuna sandwich al desko every afternoon.
Many find themselves more prone to distraction in open office layouts.
Since founding JotForm in 2006, we‚Äôve dabbled in different office designs. And as we‚Äôve grown to over 130 employees, we figured no other design felt like navigating a minefield ‚Äî opportunities for destruction are all around.
Many argue that open office design fosters communication between employees and such enhanced collaboration makes up for the negative impact distraction has on your team productivity.
But do open offices really boost collaboration?
In 2018, Harvard Business School Associate Professor Ethan Bernstein published a study analyzing the impacts of open workspaces on collaboration.
It was the first study of its kind to look empirically at how a transition to open offices affected employees‚Äô productivity and daily interactions.
Rather than increasing face-to-face collaborations, open architecture seemed to trigger a natural human response to socially withdraw from officemates and interact over email and instant messenger instead.
Beyond interactions, the study found that workers became less productive in open offices. What‚Äôs more important from a managerial perspective, the quality of work decreased as well.
In ‚ÄúFocus on productivity, not efficiency‚Äù, I wrote about the power of getting small teams to sit together in a private space.
For starters, our employees work in small cross-functional teams of 5‚Äì6 people.
Each team includes a lead designer, who works side-by-side with UI and CSS developers, full stack developers, plus UX specialists, data scientists, and any other necessary functions.
We‚Äôve found that teams that include a member from every different role are consistently more effective.
Each group has its own room, with a door that closes, big whiteboards, big desks, space to stretch out and various productivity tools.
These private spaces help our teams to stay focused. Without the distractions of an open office full of colleagues, they have no need for noise-canceling headphones.
A University of Sydney study found that the noise is the number one element that bothers employees about open offices. And the results of noise distraction were twofold: lower productivity and higher absentee rates.
A workspace that limits distraction isn‚Äôt just an HR decision ‚Äî it‚Äôs a financial one. The Information Overload Research Group estimates that such distraction costs U.S. companies almost $1 trillion dollars annually.
Instead of fighting with distraction, our cross-functional teams collaborate openly, not self-consciously, with their team members, and build off of each other‚Äôs energy.
It‚Äôs amazing how much these rooms have increased their productivity.
Even the aforementioned Facebook offices have what they call ‚Äúbreakaway pods.‚Äù I would imagine that many Facebook employees find themselves retreating to these pods for privacy, especially for projects that require intense focus.
We‚Äôre not the only ones that support the small team model. In 2014, researchers Albert Kao and Iain Couzin published a study demonstrating that:
Opinions may differ on the optimal size of a small team.
In one book from Harvard Business Press, the authors posit that:
I believe each organization is unique and it depends on the type of organization and what types of decisions and projects are being handled.
For us, requiring 7 people in each group would be excessive in many cases. But that‚Äôs a decision for each company to make based on its business circumstances.
Open offices don‚Äôt mean that the entire office will be collaborating on each project or decision. But I also don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre conducive to effective teamwork.
When it comes to your company, there‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all office design.
Though managers may prefer open office architecture, especially for the economic benefit, a growing body of research over the last years has been demonstrating the downside of open offices.
While cubicles feel dismal, they may be no worse in terms of productivity.
For JotForm, the happy medium has been private offices for small teams of employees.
Though this may not be a feasible option for all companies at all times of day, I would recommend at least offering part-time private spaces, like breakaway pods, to your employees.
It‚Äôs worth every bit of the investment in your team.

Tim Denning|44K|3|https://medium.com/the-mission/the-power-of-doing-only-one-thing-c58c11ddfce4?source=tag_archive---------8---------------------|The Power Of Doing Only One Thing. ‚Äì The Mission ‚Äì Medium|"This idea of doing only one thing was sparked by an event that happened this week. I decided to delete all podcasts on my phone and only keep the Tim Ferriss Show. In other areas of my life, I‚Äôve done the same.
All the other things in the same category have been discarded. Here are some examples:
‚Äì I had two pairs of earphones and now I have one
‚Äì I‚Äôd read multiple books at the same time ‚Äî now I do one at a time
‚Äì I had multiple tools to cure stress and now I have one ‚Äî meditation
I then took this minimalistic approach from how I handled material possessions and applied it to what I do each day.
Here are some examples:
‚Äì I only pursue one passion now instead of many
‚Äì I only execute on one vision instead of many
‚Äì I only use my free time for one activity instead of many
If you look at each category of your life, you‚Äôll see that you spend a disproportionate amount of time in one area. I‚Äôve normally had a few passions but if I evaluate the last five years, most of my efforts have been put towards blogging.
I had a few other passions but I didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time doing them.
When I committed to doing one thing, I made a decision to stop pretending I cared about my other passions.
I listened to lots of podcasts until recently and I was constantly trying to keep up with the latest episodes. I found many of the podcasts shared similar messages and only one of them was life-changing in my eyes (The Tim Ferriss Podcast).
Now that I only listen to one podcast I can finally enjoy it, quit rushing and even playback episodes I‚Äôve listened to already. Seeing the podcast screen with only one show on there is so refreshing!
Look at your life and you‚Äôll see similar patterns.
Doing one thing gives you extreme focus. This focus can be channelled towards tasks that lead to mastery instead of trying to dabble in lots of unrelated passions.
Focus is how you reach states of flow and achieve results that look impossible.
Doing one thing causes you to focus and practice more. Through this process, you can see your failures, areas of improvement and areas that you‚Äôre good at. This form of reflection gives you real-time feedback that can further compound your results.
We can‚Äôt compute too many things at once. The power of doing one thing is that you avoid overwhelm. We can all manage one thing in each area of our life. The moment we introduce too many choices we end up with decision fatigue.
Overwhelm is selling yourself the false reality that you have to do everything to be successful. I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs the complete opposite.
To be successful, you have to focus and do one thing. Being successful is about not giving up and if you consistently put yourself into a state of overwhelm then you‚Äôll simultaneously increase your negative thought patterns.
This milkshake of negativity will mix together and end up in failure if you let it.
Overwhelm is the enemy of passion and energy. Passion and energy become hyper-focused when you focus on one thing.
One podcast.
One business.
One romantic partner.
One vision.
One passion.
Embrace the power of doing one thing.

A fearsome empire was striving for world domination and crushing their competitors with an iron fist.
Their strategy?
Meanwhile, an impertinent upstart was lurking in the wings ‚Äî one that would eventually bid to overcome the empire.
The upstart‚Äôs motto?
Ok, this might sound like the intro to a superhero movie.
But it‚Äôs the tale of two of the mightiest corporations of all time:
The killer twist?
The good guys turned to the dark side.
They took Microsoft‚Äôs rallying cry and made it their own.
I‚Äôm sitting in my favorite coffee shop as I write this. Their lattes are strong and the wifi is speedy.
Of course, once in a while, I have login problems, or poor data speeds ‚Äî but it‚Äôs rare.
It‚Äôs rare because hardware manufacturers and software developers have agreed on a standard. In fact, a few of them: as Andy Tanenbaum said,
Our modern world relies on people agreeing to work by common rules. And in the online sphere, this begins with open standards. As the principles state:
Think of good old plain text files.
For the English-speaking world, the underlying standard is ASCII, which sets down the rules for encoding the alphabet as 0s and 1s.
Now, imagine a universe in which you had to pay a $1 licensing fee every time you wanted to read or write a text file in ASCII. It would be a nightmare, right?
Luckily, that would never happen. Because we have rules.
Take HTML, the standard language for writing web pages, invented in the ‚Äô90s by Tim Berners-Lee.
The HTML specification has evolved over the years, and the W3C acts as a forum for gaining specification consensus from large players such as Adobe, Apple, Google, Intel, and Microsoft.
But there‚Äôs been a history of skirmishes, with different companies proposing their own variants. During the first browser wars, Netscape proposed a <blink> tag, while Microsoft came up with <marquee>, which was meant to cause text to scroll in various directions.
There‚Äôs no problem with that (apart from lousy aesthetics), right? Wrong. Because only Netscape Navigator knew what to do with <blink>, and only Internet Explorer knew what to do with <marquee>.
They were modifying a standard so that it would only run with their software.
They were trying to build a monopoly.
Microsoft famously coined the phrase ‚Äúembrace, extend, extinguish‚Äù to describe their strategy for dominating markets where competitors benefited from open standards.
Here‚Äôs an example of how it played out.
Back in the day, the most powerful PC software package was Lotus 1‚Äì2‚Äì 3. It was the classic killer app for the IBM PC and Microsoft‚Äôs MS-DOS operating system.
To overcome Lotus, Microsoft knew it had to embrace what made the product unique. This meant it had to load Lotus files and the macros that came with them. Enter Excel, a spreadsheet program that initially ran on Macs.
The functionality of Excel was as similar to Lotus as it could be without being a blatant rip-off. So close, in fact, that people could switch from Lotus to Excel with minimal pain.
What‚Äôs more, Microsoft used the graphics capabilities of Macs to equip Excel with a cool GUI. This was a leap ahead of standard MS-DOS packages like Lotus 1‚Äì2‚Äì3.
Next, Microsoft extended by creating Office: the holy trinity of Excel, Word, and Powerpoint, all running together on Windows. By 1995, these programs were working together well, and although there were a number of word processors to choose from, there weren‚Äôt any compelling competitors for Excel on Windows.
Microsoft sharpened their competitive edge with company discounts and clever Office 95 marketing, and as a result, most major businesses were adopting it as their standardized software suite ‚Äî and Excel was part of the bundle. No need to buy a standalone package like Lotus 1‚Äì2‚Äì3.
Meanwhile, Symphony ‚Äî the Lotus integrated package for MS-DOS that aimed to compete with Office ‚Äî never prospered and was eventually abandoned. Microsoft had officially extinguished Lotus 1‚Äì2‚Äì3.
They wanted Office to become the gold standard for productivity software. And they succeeded. But not long after establishing the dominance of their desktop operating system, Microsoft realized that another challenge was looming.
Not only could people browse websites that were outside Microsoft‚Äôs control, but Netscape introduced the JavaScript scripting language which allowed developers to write code that ran in the browser. In effect, Netscape was inventing a new operating system, distributed between the client-side browser and the remote server.
Even worse, content on the web was platform-agnostic: browsers worked just fine on Macs and Unix as well as Windows, so an application that ran in the browser would rip open the Microsoft business model.
In order to get a piece of the action, Microsoft launched Internet Explorer (IE) in 1995 as a direct competitor to Netscape Navigator. Initially, it only had a tiny market share: less than 10% by the close of 1996. So this was more of an air kiss than a full embrace of the internet.
Things heated up with the release of IE3, bundled as a free component of Windows in 1996, and integrating a number of apps that were part of the Microsoft ecosystem: an internet mail client (later to become Outlook Express), an address book, and the Windows Media Player. IE4 continued the extend theme by bundling programs for the chat and video conferencing.
At the same time, Microsoft re-engineered the Windows desktop look and feel to make it more like browsing a web page. How did Netscape Navigator fit into this cozy set up?
Not at all ‚Äî it functioned increasingly worse on the Microsoft operating system. By the end of the decade, Internet Explorer had 86% of the browser market.
- Game over for Netscape.
Today, Microsoft is working hard to shed its ‚Äòevil‚Äô reputation, contributing to open source and supporting open standards.
But we may have a new villain on our hands...
It was March 31, 2004.
The headlines were in a frenzy:
At the time, the news seemed outrageous. A search engine company? Launching a free email service? With an alleged storage capacity of 1GB ‚Äî 500 times bigger than what Microsoft‚Äôs Hotmail offered?!
In fact, when April 1st rolled around and Google issued a press release officially announcing Gmail, most people took it as a far-fetched hoax.
Boasting massive storage, a slick interface, instant search, and personalization options, it was real ‚Äî and revolutionary.
Not only did Gmail blow Hotmail and Yahoo Mail out of the water, but it was also the first app with the potential to replace conventional PC software.
According to Georges Harik, who was responsible for most of Google‚Äôs new products at the time:
Google had officially extended email. And, while they didn‚Äôt extinguish other email providers entirely, they certainly came close.
Then there‚Äôs AMP. The Accelerated Mobile Pages Project (AMP) is a technology that enables web pages to load more rapidly on mobile devices.
AMP was originally targeted at news publishers, to compete with Facebook‚Äôs Instant Articles, but it has now far outstripped the latter, after being adopted by platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, and LinkedIn
As a strategy, AMP is Google‚Äôs most brazen. It serves as a vehicle for routing users through the Google Content Delivery Network even if they‚Äôre reading content from other websites. Sites that don‚Äôt adopt AMP get pushed out of Google mobile search results and into oblivion.
Or, extinguished.
There‚Äôs also the infamous case of Google Reader, which dug the grave for RSS (Rich Site Summary).
RSS‚Äôs decline was evident before Google axed it, but killing Reader dealt a massive blow to any of RSS‚Äôs remaining momentum. Google said themselves they wanted to consolidate users onto the rest of their services ‚Äî none of which support any open syndication standards.
Tech writer Ed Bott summarizes eloquently:
Last but not least, there‚Äôs PDF.
To recap:
PDFs have a feature that allows forms to be submitted. This feature previously worked on all PDF viewers (such as Adobe Acrobat and Apple Preview). That is until Chrome started their own viewers for PDF files.
As Google‚Äôs browser gained market share (now hitting over 60% in the usage stakes), most people began viewing PDFs in Chrome‚Äôs native PDF reader. But, here‚Äôs the kicker: Chrome doesn‚Äôt support all of PDF‚Äôs features.
For example, my company, JotForm, has a feature called fillable PDF Forms. It lets you create PDF forms, which you can submit.
So, forms created with Adobe or JotForm‚Äôs PDF tool often don‚Äôt work on Chrome. We have to instruct people to use Adobe Acrobat instead, which creates needless friction.
In a nutshell, Google‚Äôs behavior prevents us from investing more deeply in the PDF Forms.
So all of this begs the question:
Does Google really support open source?
In 1995, it was Microsoft vs. Netscape.
In 2018, it‚Äôs Google vs. Apple.
The only difference lies in strategy. Google is playing the long game to take Apple down.
Rather than create products that are a dramatic improvement on Apple‚Äôs, they make them almost-as-good, or equally good ‚Äî and cheaper.
Take Chromebooks. They aren‚Äôt as slick and speedy as Macbooks. But they offer similar usability ‚Äî and you can buy three for the cost of one iPad. Plus, they‚Äôre brilliantly marketed.
Or Android. It‚Äôs as close a replica to iOS as you can imagine.
Or Pixel. Compared to the iPhone, it has a better camera, faster charging, smoother performance, and a more useful digital assistant, for a lower price.
Google is extending with their growing selection of products, including an Amazon Echo competitor, a smart router, TV, a VR headset, and a list of nest devices. Although these products will work mostly with iOS devices, they will work better with Android phones, and/or the Pixel.
All of these factors make migration look increasingly more promising. Apple has been cutting manufacturing costs while pricing its products ever higher, which means the user experience has plummeted.
Not to mention the scandal that erupted when we learned that Apple deliberately slows older products in a bid to encourage users to upgrade.
All of these factors lay fertile ground for Google to overtake Apple.
In fact, Apple customer loyalty is arguably the only real obstacle in Google‚Äôs way. But if enough people get frustrated with Apple‚Äôs pricing strategy, it could signal the end of Apple‚Äôs reign as we know it.
Twenty years ago, the browser wars were raging.
There was stiff competition ‚Äî and that was a good thing because it prevented a monopoly.
With competition comes innovation. In fact, this period of intense rivalry led to the web we have now.
The Big Tech Five continue to swallow up smaller companies. And as their monopoly grows, I‚Äôd argue that innovation is dwindling.
Openness and added value are being sacrificed at the altar of revenue and market share. And Google is at the forefront of this. Most recently, Chrome announced their ‚Äúmost controversial initiative yet‚Äù: fundamentally rethinking URLs across the web. Without a URL, the only way to access a page is via Google.
Ed Bott compares Google to Godzilla:
And he‚Äôs right. Google‚Äôs convenience and power are overwhelming. But we can‚Äôt let that blind us to the reality of what they‚Äôre doing.
However you look at it, embrace, extend, extinguish is pivotal to Google‚Äôs strategy. Granted, no one in Google is sending explicit instructions as Bill Gates once did, but they don‚Äôt need to ‚Äî the end result is the same.
EEE certainly looks different today than it did in 2000; it‚Äôs subtler, friendlier, more politically correct.
But it‚Äôs just as dangerous. The war isn‚Äôt over. We must fight to diversify the internet, uphold open standards, and stamp out monopoly.

Maybe the company you work for doesn‚Äôt have a full-time designer and you need to implement the UI for a new feature on your own. Or maybe you‚Äôre hacking on a side-project and you want it to look better than yet-another-Bootstrap-site.
It‚Äôs easy to throw your hands up and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be able to make this look good, I‚Äôm not an artist!‚Äù but it turns out there are a ton of tricks you can use to level up your work that don‚Äôt require a background in graphic design.
Here are seven simple ideas you can use to improve your designs today.
A common mistake when styling UI text is relying too much on font size to control your hierarchy.
‚ÄúIs this text important? Let‚Äôs make it bigger.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs this text secondary? Let‚Äôs make it smaller.‚Äù
Instead of leaving all of the heavy lifting to font size alone, try using color or font weight to do the same job.
‚ÄúIs this text important? Let‚Äôs make it bolder.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs this text secondary? Let‚Äôs use a lighter color.‚Äù
Try and stick to two or three colors:
Similarly, two font weights is usually enough for UI work:
Stay away from font weights under 400 for UI work; they can work for large headings but are too hard to read at smaller sizes. If you‚Äôre considering using a lighter weight to de-emphasize some text, use a lighter color or smaller font size instead.
Making text a lighter grey is a great way to de-emphasize it on white backgrounds, but it doesn‚Äôt look so great on colored backgrounds.
That‚Äôs because the effect we‚Äôre actually seeing with grey on white is reduced contrast.
Making the text closer to the background color is what actually helps create hierarchy, not making it light grey.
There are two ways you can reduce contrast when working with colorful backgrounds:
Use white text and lower the opacity. This lets the background color bleed through a bit, de-emphasizing the text in a way that doesn‚Äôt clash with the background.
This works better than reducing the opacity when your background is an image or pattern, or when reducing the opacity makes the text feel too dull or washed out.
Choose a color that‚Äôs the same hue as the background, adjusting saturation and lightness until it looks right to you.
Instead of using large blur and spread values to make box shadows more noticeable, add a vertical offset.
It looks a lot more natural because it simulates a light source shining down from above like we‚Äôre used to seeing in the real world.
This applies to inset shadows like you might use on wells or form inputs too:
If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about shadow design, the Material Design Guidelines are a fantastic primer.
When you need to create separation between two elements, try to resist immediately reaching for a border.
While borders are a great way to distinguish two elements from one another, they aren‚Äôt the only way, and using too many of them can make your design feel busy and cluttered.
The next time you find yourself reaching for a border, try one of these ideas instead:
Box shadows do a great job of outlining an element like a border would, but can be more subtle and accomplish the same goal without being as distracting.
Giving adjacent elements slightly different background colors is usually all you need to create distinction between them. If you‚Äôre already using different background colors in addition to a border, try removing the border; you might not need it.
What better way to create separation between elements than to simply increase the separation? Spacing things further apart is a great way to create distinction between groups of elements without introducing any new UI at all.
If you‚Äôre designing something that could use some large icons (like maybe the ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù section of a landing page), you might instinctively grab a free icon set like Font Awesome or Zondicons and bump up the size until they fit your needs.
They‚Äôre vector images after all, so the quality isn‚Äôt going to suffer if you increase the size right?
While it‚Äôs true that vector images won‚Äôt degrade in quality when you increase their size, icons that were drawn at 16‚Äì24px are never going to look very professional when you blow them up to 3x or 4x their intended size. They lack detail, and always feel disproportionately ‚Äúchunky‚Äù.
If small icons are all you‚Äôve got, try enclosing them inside another shape and giving the shape a background color:
This lets you keep the actual icon closer to its intended size, while still filling the larger space.
If you have the budget, you could also use a premium icon set designed to be used at larger sizes, like Heroicons or Iconic.
If you‚Äôre not a graphic designer, how do you add that dash of visual flair to your UI that other designs get from beautiful photography or colorful illustrations?
One simple trick that can make a big difference is to add colorful accent borders to parts of your interface that would otherwise feel a bit bland.
For example, along the side of an alert message:
...or to highlight active navigation items:
...or even across the top of your entire layout:
It doesn‚Äôt take any graphic design talent to add a colored rectangle to your UI, and it can go a long way towards making your site feel more ‚Äúdesigned.‚Äù
Have a hard time picking colors? Try choosing from a constrained palette like Dribbble‚Äôs color search to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the endless possibilities of a traditional color picker.
When there are multiple actions a user can take on a page, it‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of designing those actions based purely on semantics.
Frameworks like Bootstrap sort of encourage this by giving you a menu of semantic styles to choose from whenever you‚Äôre adding a new button:
‚ÄúIs this a positive action? Make the button green.‚Äù
‚ÄúDoes this delete data? Make the button red.‚Äù
Semantics are an important part of button design, but there‚Äôs a more important dimension that‚Äôs commonly forgotten: hierarchy.
Every action on a page sits somewhere in a pyramid of importance. Most pages only have one true primary action, a couple of less important secondary actions, and a few seldom used tertiary actions.
When designing these actions, it‚Äôs important to communicate their place in the hierarchy.
‚ÄúWhat about destructive actions, shouldn‚Äôt they always be red?‚Äù
Not necessarily! If the destructive action isn‚Äôt the primary action on the page, it might be better to give it a secondary or tertiary button treatment.
Save the big, red, and bold styling for when that negative action actually is the primary action in the interface, like in a confirmation dialog:

Margaret P|4.3K|5|https://medium.com/microsoft-design/kill-your-personas-1c332d4908cc?source=---------1---------------------|Kill Your Personas ‚Äì Microsoft Design ‚Äì Medium|"Article written with Doug Kim
In 1983, Alan Cooper gave life to the first design persona with a wave of his hands. A pioneering software developer, Cooper had just interviewed a group of potential customers. He realized that focusing on real customer motivations rather than his own needs could spark better solutions to complicated problems. For the rest of his design critique, Cooper began assuming the gestures, speaking habits, and thought processes of made-up individuals who were loosely based on the people he‚Äôd interviewed.
Personas quickly took off in both design curriculum and the software industry. And for good reason: personas help us gain a better understanding of our customers‚Äô needs and anticipate how they might act in situations where direct communication with them isn‚Äôt feasible.
But we‚Äôve since realized a problem with personas. They are inherently an amalgamation, an average of attributes that we imagine our average customer has. And there‚Äôs no such thing as the average customer.
In the 1950s, the US Air Force conducted a famous study on pilot size. They measured the physical dimensions of more than 4,000 pilots and calculated the average size along 140 dimensions, like height and chest circumference. They arrived at an average range for all 140 dimensions and theorized that most pilots would fit within that range. As it turns out, not a single pilot of all 4,000 fit within the average range for all 10 dimensions.
The consequences of designing for the average pilot were potentially deadly. The ergonomics of planes, which were built based on ‚Äúaverage‚Äù pilot size, were so off that pilots were crashing as a result. The planes were created for everyone but really no one at all.
We repeat the same error every day in product development. We imagine a persona ‚Äî let‚Äôs say his name is Ted. We give him attributes, like a family, a high-powered job, a suburban house, and two cars (see main image). Maybe he‚Äôs got a cat. Then we‚Äôll have debates about what Ted would or wouldn‚Äôt like. ‚ÄúCan you really imagine that Ted would be ok with that product decision? From what I understand about Ted‚Äôs profile, I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù
And really, no one knows what Ted would like because Ted doesn‚Äôt exist. It sounds obvious when you put it that way. But it‚Äôs challenging, because the more ‚Äúhuman‚Äù we try to make Ted by adding specific personality traits and details about his habits, the more we unconsciously stereotype him. We make it harder on ourselves in the heat of the moment to remember that Ted is an abstract representation of research insights.
Even worse, every bit of overly specific detail we attribute to Ted makes him less representative of the general audience we want to design for. In such design work, the person who doesn‚Äôt exist can begin to erode and erase the presence of people who actually do. Often, ‚ÄòTeds‚Äô are: created in siloes without a defined goal or purpose, kept static across time and use cases, not flexible and adaptable, and, grounded in artifacts product teams/designers can‚Äôt use.
We need tools that reintroduce diversity into our design process. Every decision we make either raises or lowers barriers to participation in society. Inclusive design emphasizes our responsibility to solve for mismatches between humans and their products, environments, and social structures. We need ways to check, balance, and measure the inclusivity of our designs.
So how can we put real customers first and circumvent the notion of an artificial average? One way is to kill your personas (sorry, Ted) and adopt a model of persona spectrums. Instead of defining one character, persona spectrums focus our attention on a range of customer motivations, contexts, abilities, and circumstances.
A persona spectrum is not a fake person. It‚Äôs an articulation of a specific human motivation and the ways it‚Äôs shared across multiple groups. It shows how that motivation can change depending on context. Sometimes, a trait can be permanent, like someone who has been blind since birth. A person recovering from eye surgery might temporarily have limited or no vision. Another person might face this barrier in certain environments, like when dealing with screen glare out in the sun. How would your product adapt to this range of people and circumstances with similar needs?
Persona spectrums aren‚Äôt perfect, but they help us create more equitable experiences. They use the power of personas to ground and humanize user insight while keeping different human attributes distinct. By designing along a spectrum of need and motivation, we avoid the biases and assumptions built into a persona. We design for a diverse range of real users instead of one average, theoretical Ted.
Persona spectrums are more than just a tool for empathy. They also make a business case. Say you‚Äôre designing for someone with one arm. There are roughly 20,000 people in the US with one arm. But if you add up the numbers of people with one arm, people with a temporary wrist injury or a broken arm, and folks with one free hand in a specific circumstance (like new parents lugging a baby around), you‚Äôre at 20 million in the U.S. alone.
At Microsoft Design, we‚Äôre working to use persona spectrums across a range of products. We‚Äôre asking hard questions about the intent and limitations of our personas, so we can design for real people in real situations. We use these spectrums to ideate and iterate in the design process alongside a series of physical, social, economic, temporal, cultural contexts.
It‚Äôs important to learn from diversity and bring people into the process from the very beginning. By gathering real insights from real people who share the motivations we‚Äôre designing for, we can start understanding and incorporating the full range of human diversity, designing for individuality and the motivations that unify us.
In the coming weeks, we‚Äôll share actionable insight for building your own. In the meantime, learn more about how to design with inclusive in mind by downloading our Inclusive Design tool kit.

This article focuses on the common dos and don‚Äôts of form design. Keep in mind that these are general guideline and there are exceptions to every rule.
Omit optional fields and think of other ways to collect data. Always ask yourself if the question can be inferred, postponed, or completely excluded.
Data entry is increasingly automated. For example, mobile and wearable devices collect large amounts of data without the user‚Äôs conscious awareness. Think of ways you can leverage social, conversational UI, SMS, email, voice, OCR, location, fingerprint, biometric, etc.
Life is short. No one wants to fill out a form. Be conversational. Be funny. Gradually engage. Do the unexpected. It is the role of the designer to express their company‚Äôs brand to elicit an emotional reaction. If done correctly, it will increase completion rates. Just make sure you don‚Äôt violate the rules listed above.

We started seeing this last year with colorful backdrops and modern, still-life positioning. This year, brands are building on that and taking it a step further by integrating other elements that almost mimic retail window displays.
This creative way of displaying product images will be particularly pertinent to B2B brands‚Äô evolution into booming e-commerce sales. According to E-Commerce Platforms via Hubspot, B2B e-commerce sales are expected to outgrow B2C e-commerce sales by 2020.
Take a look at a few of the examples below. Couldn‚Äôt you see similar concepts walking through the mall during your holiday shopping?
Let‚Äôs throw it back to a few original designs from the feel-good decade. The fluid, round shapes evocative of a lava lamp. The unmistakable color palettes of an entire era.
Similarly to a beautifully restored classic movie, the new Seventies-inspired designs take all the emotions of the classic designs but add higher resolution and clarity. The result? Some seriously stunning shapes and color palettes that are fun, relaxed, welcoming, and unconventional.
Why of course you can, old sport. But I‚Äôm not talking about another Gatsby, art deco revival. I‚Äôm talking about busting open another time capsule, this time from the late 1800s to early 1900s. An aesthetic created by painstaking work done on a lithograph, the style is defined by an illusion of depth with shadows, vignettes, and layering with dimensional banners or ribbons.
Challenging even for today‚Äôs designers, these intricate and deliberate designs are staying pretty true to the original inspiration.
Check out the examples below from Alphonse Mucha, a famous Czech artist and pioneer in the Art Nouveau movement. He created these late 1800s advertisements for JOB cigarette rolling papers and MoeÃàt & Chandon.
And now let‚Äôs come back to the present. Take a look at this beautiful packaging created for a tea company by Chinese designer Tiger Pan.
You don‚Äôt have to go all the way overseas to see this trend; here‚Äôs an innovative pop-up shop by Harry‚Äôs in the middle of Grand Central Station.
If you read my post on 2017 design trends, you‚Äôll remember it was all about loud color schemes. A large part of 2019 will be all about these soft, delicate naturally-occurring colors. Think shell pink, sandy beige, faded seafoam green, and more natural neutrals.
Digital art vs. traditional art. It‚Äôs an age-old battle that people love to Photoshop-shame designers, and harass traditional artists for not being with the times. But can‚Äôt we all just get along? In 2019, you‚Äôll see more digitization of hand-drawn illustrations, typography, and graphics. You‚Äôre also going to see hyper-realistic brush strokes, down to the bubbles in traditional watercolor to the imperfect streaks of pastels.
For the past three years, designs have been carefully constructed. Well developed. Thoughtful.
Now it‚Äôs time for you to meet chaos. F@$% best practices. This is a visceral, go-all-in, move-fast, break-it-all kind of trend. So is it just a rebel cry for more freedom artistically? Not exactly. If anything, this is the most psychological, purposeful of all the trends on this post. Much to the dismay of all the perfectionist designers out there, chaos cuts through the mundane. It‚Äôs stopping you in your tracks. It makes you stop as you‚Äôre walking up the same street you take to work every day. It makes you stop if you‚Äôre clicking through the usual number of emails in your inbox. Clean only belongs to some brands, but chaos is for everyone, if you dare. Remember, there are no rules here.
So many flawless designs. Just like Marcia‚Äôs nose, they are pretty and perfect ‚Äî and completely predictable. Stemming off from the chaos theory that audiences will stop to stare, the ‚Äúruined‚Äù trend is for brands that want to bring something new to the proverbial table (but not destroy the table, kthx).
But why would you want to ruin a perfectly great design? Our prehistoric brains fill in the gaps of what we see with things that we are familiar with and expect. And although this helped us to not get eaten by lions, tigers, and bears, our brains still operate on those principles. The ruined trend is simply throwing our brains a little bit of confusion. A brushstroke over the eyes of a model on a magazine cover. A colorful splatter in the corner of an otherwise perfectly minimalistic ad. An unexpected cutout in a font. A girl letting go of a heart-shaped balloon, half-shredded. Wink, wink.

JoseÃÅ Torre|548|13|https://uxdesign.cc/10-skills-that-make-a-great-designer-5e1e1f43fa0c?source=---------5---------------------|10 skills that make a great designer ‚Äì UX Collective|"So... during this year I embraced a few new responsibilities, amongst them a little girl (now 9 month old), which partially explains the huge gap between this article and the last one I wrote.
Work-wise, one of the responsibilities I took for the first time was hiring a designer for my team, for the first time in my career I was on the other side of an open vacancy, which made me think a lot about what makes a good designer.
Full transparency, I didn't came up with this list then, but more recently I thought it could be a good exercise of reflection, could be handy for the future, and it could also become a starting point for a good article (fingers crossed) that could be useful, not only for people in the same position I was a few months ago, but also for people that are actually applying for a design job.
I based this article on my experience, basically skills that helped me move forward as well as skills that I see in other designers that I admire and respect. You will also see that some of the examples are a bit more focused on UX design, because that's the reality I'm more familiar with these days.
With that out of the way, let's start.
I like to compare design principles with the ancient biblical commandments, if you follow them you have a place in the design heaven (aka a happy user/audience), if you don't you end up being ""punished"".
However, unlike the commandments, design principles are not a list of things you should/shouldn't do, they are merely a list of general guidelines that are meant to help you address basic human expectation & behaviours.
Knowing the principles it's not memorising a list of things. You know the principles when you don't even think about it and they become part of your instinct, almost like muscle memory. When you really know them, you'll react instinctively when you're designing or reviewing a design. They will kick in and make you increase the font, move the icon a few pixels to the left or speed up a transition a fraction of a second.
In the end, design principles are really a mean to an end, which is to make your design feel right.
If you want to read a bit more about principles, I wrote an article in the past about visual design principles (#shamelessplug).
Once you know the principles, if you're curious and have an eye for detail (two traits a designer must have, in my opinion) you'll look at the world a bit differently, and you'll notice things that you didn't even think about before.If you're a bit like me, you can find joy in random encounters with hipster barber shops with amazing calligraphy on the window. On the other side of the spectrum you'll get itchy when you look at a speed limit sign and the text is not properly aligned.
Why is this important? Believe it or not, your visual culture will very much influence your design output. The idea of inventing something completely new is nice but the cold hard truth is that after 6000 years of civilisation, as we know it, the large majority of things are simply a remix of something else, whether we do it deliberately or not that's a different story. Either way, there's nothing wrong with that as long as you try to bring your own twist to it. Simply ripping off someone else's work is completely unforgivable, if you're going to steal at least do it like an artist.
Hence I think it's clear the importance of designers opening their horizons as much as possible. The more they know, the more ammunition they will have when they need to come up with something ""new"".
A designer needs to know how to design. Kind of obvious, right?If you have brilliant ideas but you can't visualise them, you're going to have an hard time in taking them to the next level.Being able to visualise these ideas helps you make them more tangible and easier to grasp for others, so they can see what you do, without being inside your head. That‚Äôs why people say a picture is worth a 1000 words.
To sell ideas you don't need pixel perfect designs or hyper-realistic prototypes, you just need to be able to give your audience a glimpse of what you idea can become. It can be as simple as a sketch on paper that illustrates the idea and makes it real enough.
With that said, based on my experience I came to learn that, the better picture you can paint, the easier it will be for you to tell your story and sell that idea.You might argue that if the idea is good it will support itself, the problem with that statement is the fact that some people might not see what you do, no matter how many times you try to explain it (with words).
One of your superpowers, as a designer, is turning ideas into reality.This can be as simple as making a couple sketches on a piece of paper but it can become as complex as making a prototype so realistic that people will mistake it for the real thing. Depending on the stage and problem that your trying to solve the necessity will vary, but being able to do both will definitely put you ahead.
Another reason for ""painting a good picture"" is the fact that people perceive something that looks good as something easier to understand than something that doesn't. If something is poorly put together that, most likely, will transpire to the idea, even if it was a good one.People should not judge a book by it's cover, but I'm kind of happy they do, otherwise I would be out of a job.
A designer's job isn't knowing the solution to a problem, their job is to know how to look for a solution. Do you see the difference?
The difference is that instead of instantaneously coming up with the solution, a good designer will ask questions, will research, will think about it, will experiment, will most likely fail and repeat this process again and again until they come up with the right solution.
A great designer experiments without the fear of failing because sometimes only after failing you realise the solution was staring at you the whole time. This means that many times, most of the time spent designing will seem like it was a waste of time, because you end up throwing away a big chunk of the work you did. However the reality is that without all that failing you wound't be able to know what the solution was, it's all part of the process.
Experiment without fear also means having to do it over and over again, this constant experimentation and iteration should just feel like breathing oxygen, you do it and you don't even think about it. Having this trait is essential if you want to stretch the boundaries of what can be done, because when you're not afraid of proposing something that will be rejected the range of possible solutions will grow substantially.
Designing is very much an exercise of using empathy (with your target user) and intuition to come up with possible solutions to a problem. I would like to stress the word possible because that's all they really are until you validate it. As a designer, it's very difficult and dangerous to say that I have THE answer without actually having people look at it and trying it out.
With my experience I learned that even when you have that gut feeling like ""this has to be the best possible solution"", there‚Äôs always something to gain by sharing the work and getting a different perspective. It doesn't need to be a fully blown user test by the way, it can be as easy as sharing with the colleague sitting next to you.
When you design in a bubble it's easy to get lost in your idea and even easier to start to see it as natural and intuitive. Because you came up with it and have been looking at it for the past couple of hours it's going to seem like the most obvious thing in the world.
With that said, it's also good to mention that we also need to be pragmatic and learn from what has been tested to death. Not everything needs to be tested. A designer's intuition is made of design principles, design patterns, affordances, design history, years of experience with the world with a mind focused on design, and I think that can't be ignored. You just need to learn to know how much we can trust in that and try to detach yourself from the work you do, so you can look at it and see whether or not it achieves the goal you're trying to accomplish.
Adding to this point I think it's important to mention an essential hard skill required, which is to be able to make something that can be tested.You can test static images but I think prototyping is becoming more and more an ""hygiene"" skill that any designer really needs to have.
This one is also kind of obvious but I couldn't really leave it out. The notion that a good idea needs no explaining is a myth. Good design doesn't sell it self, if you want to push it forward you need to know how to make a compelling case that will win over your audience.
You don't need to be a salesman, you just need to know how to present and explain your work. Understand who's your audience first, so you can paint a picture in a way that they can understand. Show them how your design relates back to the original goal and how it serves the people that you're targeting.
If you're a bit of an introvert (like me), this idea might sound a bit scary and uncomfortable, but it's actually easier than talking to strangers, at least I speak for myself. This is all about design, sharing your line of thinking and making people buy into your idea. See it as your playground but do your homework, prepare well and if needed rehearse until you have your story locked down.
I wrote an article that touches this topic is the past too (#shamelessplugnumber2).
I hate to break it to you, but if you don‚Äôt know how to communicate the work that you do, then I can guarantee you'll have a tough time in moving your ideas forward, or even in landing a job as designer.
You just presented your design work, brace yourself, now comes the toughest part for the majority of designers... feedback, more specifically negative feedback.
It's all good if all you get is praise and cheers, but when people start to take apart your design and find something you didn't consider, that's when the shields come up and designers start become super defensive.
Same happens during user tests, when we see people not understanding what we've spent days refining. Then we put our shields up again and start trying to find excuses to cover up our failed hypotheses.There's not such a things as a dumb user, there's only dumb designs.
A great designer has thick skin and knows that critiquing the work is not critiquing the designer. They know this is the only way to look at your own work critically, they also know how to take feedback and try to see whether or not it makes sense for the goal they're trying to accomplish.Last but not least, they listen, that's the only way you can improve and take your ideas to the next level.
The ultimate mission for a designer is to make the world better through their work, and to be able to actually achieve it they need to care about their user or audience more than they care about their ego. Why? Because very often the solution to someone else's problem will not align with your personal preference as a designer.
This doesn't mean that you have to settle for a solution that is not at the level that you would like it to be. A great designer doesn't settle for good enough, they strive to find what can be improved, what can be the vision for the future and what problems might arise then. All this without forgetting who they are designing for.
This mindset when it's ingrained, spreads to the designer's experience with the real world. You can see this expressed by designers in two forms. One, normally expressed by the majority, it's all about instagram & tweet everything that is wrong with the world, kinda easy to do once you know a bit about design.The other comes from a smaller set of people, that will actually come up with ways to improve things, rather than just pointing them out, because that's what a great designer wants to really do, to solve the problem, not just complain about it.
Working in the real world usually means a lot of limitations that will be in your way to deliver something great, that's one of the reasons why you don't find in the app store most of the great animations you find on dribbble, and this reality will tempt you to take the easy route and just deliver the very basic. This is where you can separate wheat from chaff, a great designer will get around the limitations, will question them, and will still push for the best possible solution.
This doesn't mean that they will ignore all the limitations, it just means that they will try to get around them, and invest some time in something extra, let's call it a a trump card they can use, next to a ""basic"" solution.From my experience, having this trump card sometimes is enough to make some of the limitations being reevaluated. In other cases this might not make the limitations change, but it can be enough to inspire someone else to come up with a way to get it done within the limitations.Remember, you're job is not to come up with the solution but to find it. If you can inspire somebody else to come up with it, then you did it right.
Last but not least, what I consider one of the most important skill in a designer is humility. Knowing that they're not the source of all of the the truth, and that they only have to gain if they work and listen to others, no matter their seniority, roles or area of expertise.
As a designer you are the expert when it comes to design and you should act like one, I'm not saying you shouldn't. What I'm saying is that you should not automatically discard someone's feedback just because it's their personal opinion. Or just because it came from someone with no design background or even someone with less experience.
The same goes the other way around though, you should not take someone else's opinion as source of truth, just because they're your boss or because they have more seniority than you. You need to weigh in the feedback against the goals the design is supposed to achieve and then conclude if you need to do something with it or not.
Humility also means that you ask when you don't know something, and you are not afraid of doing so. As a designer, asking questions should be in your DNA and it's nothing to be ashamed of.
Without asking questions is a bit difficult to get to the answers, as already pointed out twice in this article, a designer is not paid to know the answers, they're paid to find them.
Next to this 10 things, of course it helps if you have your hard skills on point, after all, the reality is that you won't be able to cross all this 10 skills if you don't have the hard skills unlocked.
With all that said, I hope you find it useful and I'm curious to know... can you think of other traits that you consider essential that I forgot to mention? If so, join the discussion in the comments bellow.

Eugen EsÃßanu|889|15|https://uxplanet.org/gamification-understanding-the-basics-2bbcce365c33?source=---------6---------------------|Gamification: Understanding The Basics ‚Äì UX Planet|"All of us heard about how games can become addictive and a way of escaping reality. I was supporting this idea too, that they are only a form of escapism and nothing good can come out of playing games. I have been playing games since I ever got my first console when I was 10 years old.
And of course, we can hold many judgements, moral debates on how addictive they are. But I would like to dive into the basics of games, on how, contrary to popular belief, they fill in genuine human needs and help us become better people. And also, how gamification can be applied in designing products better products.
The fact that so many people all over the world are ready to spend (in total) 3 billion of hours a week playing games is a sign of something. A sign that the reality we‚Äôve built is broken and the virtual world offers more of what we need. A sign that reality isn‚Äôt able to provide us what we need.
Games provide rewards that reality isn‚Äôt. They are teaching, inspiring and engaging us in ways that reality is not. And unless we do something dramatic in the next decades, half of the population of the planet will spend a lot of energy and devotion to the game world. So we can play around this trend and design products that can help us to improve ourselves.
I finished reading Jane McGonigal‚Äôs book Reality is Broken and would love to share some thoughts I learned and what we can do better about gamification.
Let‚Äôs start with some statistics from the biggest gaming market in the world, which is US. The research says that:
I usually say that learning human behaviour is one of the most important skills because it allows you to see things differently. But looking at this statistics, which is only growing, I would say that investing in gamification is only going to bring you a positive impact in the future.
Game developers know better than anyone else how to inspire extreme effort and reward hard work. They know how to ease cooperation and collaboration before at unimaginable scales. They are innovating with new ways on how to motivate players to stick with harder challenges longer. In much bigger groups. And these crucial skills will have a significant impact on us. Whether you are designing an app with online courses or you are cafeteria around the corner.
When you take off all the technical parts of a game, you are left off with four elements: a goal, rules, a feedback system and voluntary participation.
The specific outcome players are working towards. The goal provides players with a sense of purpose.
Rules place a limitation on how players can achieve the goal. As I also mentioned in my article Why Small Teams Win and Bigger Ones Fail, limitations unleash creative ways of fixing a problem or achieving a goal.
It tells players how close they are to achieving their goal. It can take form of points, levels, progress bars, etc. For more, you can read my article The Importance of a Feedback System. Or if speaking in plain words: ‚ÄúThe game is over when...‚Äù.
This requires everyone who is playing the game to acknowledge the goal, the rules and the feedback system.
And this definition may surprise you because we are so used to saying that games are all about narrative, winning, graphics, rewards. And these elements are necessary, but they are not what defines a game. A game made of the four things I wrote above: the goal, the rules, feedback system and voluntary participation.
We are somehow used to say that gamers are lazy and all they do is play games all day. But how then do you explain the fact that they are able to put all of that effort into the game? All the work and grind that is required? How can we explain the fact that they can overcome multiple and painful failures and keep grinding until they achieve success?
Contrary to popular belief, games show us that we love hard work. But not as it is in the current reality we live in. So we need to think a bit broader than badges and points when we talk about gamification. Badges and points are only a small part of a feedback system that acknowledges that we‚Äôve done some effort. And we have to think on how to encourage more hard work.
Games make us happy because they are hard work that we choose for ourselves. And it turns our that nothing makes us happy than good, hard work. We don‚Äôt normally, think of games as hard work. After all, we play games, and we have been tought of play as the opposite. But nothing could be further from truth.
A game is an opportunity to focus our energy on something better. On something that will make us better. On something we are good at, or getting better at and enjoy. As mentioned above, a gameplay is the opposite of depression.
And that‚Äôs why so many games are addictive. Because they are able to boost our positive thinking that we are capable of doing and achieving something. When we‚Äôre in a state of optimistic engagement, it suddenly becomes biologically more possible for us to think positive thoughts. We start believing that we are worth something and we can achieve something in life. If only hard work in the real world had the same effect.
Sometimes it‚Äôs even worse, real-world hard work isn‚Äôt hard enough. You read it right. We become bored and feel underutilised. And this happens specifically in bigger companies where you feel that you don‚Äôt make a big impact by doing your small work. This is one of steps from Maslows hierarchy ‚Äî feeling appreciated for what you do. For all the hard work you put in. And games are able to reward you very well for that.
Imagine how world changing it would be to have a world that can provide better hard work to everyone. And that‚Äôs exactly what the game industry is doing today. So if you are designing your next gamified app or product, you have to think of: ‚ÄúHow can I give my users better hard work?‚Äù
For your product/app to stick with a gamification model, you have to provide better intrinsic rewards. Because more you can provide through hard work, happier people would be. There are a lot of intrinsic rewards, but here are a couple of them:
No matter when and how, it‚Äôs every day. Of course, it depends from person to person, but everybody craves it on a daily basis. It allows to see impact of our efforts.
We want to feel powerful in our own lives. We want to show people what we are good at. We want to have high chances of achieving success. And we want to see signs that we are getting better over time and can become somebody.
We are social creatures. We like to build bonds, new realtionships, be part of a community or a tribe. And we like to work with that tribe on a meaningful job.
It may be similar to first point, because we crave meaning in our satisfying work. We want to be part of something bigger, and contribute to it on a long-term.
These intrinsic rewards are an essential part of a great human experience. Beyond the basic needs of course (food, safety, etc.). So if you can implement them into your product, you have a higher chance of helping people achieving a certain goal.
One of the most popular games on the planet, developed by Blizzard Entertaiment, can teach you a lot about gamification and what we crave for. So what made this game so popular? As Jane McGonigal writes in her book ‚Äî ‚Äúblissfull productivity‚Äù.
Your primary goal in World of Warcraft is self-improvement. A kind of work that all of us love. So in the game, you get an avatar, and your job is to make that avatar better, stronger and richer in many ways possible: more experience gain, better armor, more abilities, more skills and a bigger reputation. And each of these traits are displayed on your avatar.
Most of gamified apps nowadays, don‚Äôt even get the basics of a leveling system and points. Not that they don‚Äôt work and we should think beyond them.
Let‚Äôs take as an example how WoW works. You grind your face off, and put in more than 500 hours of hard work to achieve max level. If not mistaken, the max level right now is 120. And you put in all of that work only to achieve the max level where the real game starts. This is what we get wrong with a leveling system ‚Äî at the end of it we should be unlocked different opportunities, but for most of the products it‚Äôs an ‚Äúend game‚Äù.
For each level, a user should be able to unlock different skills, stories, quests, challenges, you name it. And not use it only as a feedback system of progress. Same goes for badges. They are only a small part of a feedback system that shows we achieved a task. They shouldn‚Äôt be the core reward system of your product. The hard work and grind is the reward and a badge only acknowledges that.
Let‚Äôs say that you offer online courses. You can implement a points, badges and leveling system for your product and allow the user to start only with a couple of courses. Once they nail the first ones, or the basics, then you unlock more and more. With each level, you experience new type of tasks and challenges.
Also, it‚Äôs very important to understand that we have to make it also hard to achieve the max level and unlock the best courses. Why? What‚Äôs the point for me grinding my face off if I achieve the top level and see that everybody could do it? People need to feel a sense of pride that they achieved something which others couldn‚Äôt.
So you give points for each task, that adds up to your level. With each level, you could probably receive a new avatar/illustration that represents your profile. And people could see clearly that you are at a certain level of progress. And this is only a glimpse of how the elements can be implemented.
Only to realise that the fun part is about to start. World of Warcraft makes a couple of promises. For some players, it‚Äôs the promise of ultimate challenge that makes the incredible workload worth it. At the highest levels, you tend to experience the extreme adrenaline rush. It‚Äôs a promise for players who crave high-stakes work and extreme mental activation level up as fast as they can to reach the end game. Why? Because that‚Äôs when you get to fight the most challenging opponents. That‚Äôs when you receive the most rewarding items, discover new locations and stories, and other stuff.
And one critical point here is to realise, that the levelling up system is as important as the end game grind. If not more important. As one player says in the book ‚ÄúIf all I wanted to do is run around and kill stuff... I would play Counter-Strike. And that game is free*.‚Äù This again proves the fact that we shouldn‚Äôt strive to make stuff easier for our users if we are about to put in place gamification. But make it harder with each level, so people can feel stimulated and motivated. So they can try harder to achieve their initial goal or task.
*World of Warcraft requires a monthly fee subscription
Jane McGonigal in her book writes that, computers were made to work for us, but video games have come to demand that we work for them. This is true, but in the end it‚Äôs us who have come to demand more work.
Pretty insane to think about that isn‚Äôt it? When everybody tries to escape the rat race and not work for the rest of their lives. And this happens because most of us were not able to experience meaningful work before. We want to be given more work ‚Äî or rather more satisfying work.
Jane McGonigal also writes that satisfying work always starts with two things: a clear goal and actionable next steps toward achieving that goal. Having a clear goal motivates us to act. We know what we are supposed to do. And following actionable steps ensure that we can make progress toward the target immediately.
World of Warcraft offers a clear and guaranteed productivity with all the quests you take. You have a mission to complete ‚Äî for example, kill 10 NPC‚Äôs or bring a particular item. You bring that item, and you receive a reward for completing the quest. You also receive ‚Äúexperience‚Äù that allows you to level up and get to the next level with new quests and stories. Each quest has a step-by-step on what to do, where to go and whom to ask/kill/bring/etc.
Sonja Lyubomirsky in The How of Happiness writes that the fastest way to improve someone‚Äôs daily quality of life is to ‚Äúpresent a specific goal to a person, something to do and something to look forward (rewards)‚Äù. When a clear goal is attached to a task, she writes, it gives us energy to push, a sense of purpose. So the real work in WoW is to be rewarded with more opportunities for employment. The game is, with each level, challenging you to try something a bit harder than what you did before. And we love that.
This is the start of satisfying work. But for it to be gratifying we have to finish our work as clearly as we started. To complete the work, we must be able to see that results of our efforts as directly and immediately possible.
Visible results are satisfying because they mirror back to us a positive sense of our capabilities. When we can see what we accomplished, we can build our self-worth. And the brilliant heads-up display of World of Warcraft shows us an improvement in real time. It flashes in front of our eyes +1 stamina, +1 intellect, +1 strength. We can count our internal resources by these points, watching as we become more powerful with every effort.
We can also see the progress we have made by looking at our avatar. It provides visual feedback with more and better armour, jewels and weapons over time. The same thing can be applied for apps. With each task completed, we should reward users with something different at all levels. And when users compare their results to each other, you can clearly say who is at a higher level or who worked or grinded more.
And it‚Äôs not only self-improvement that the game provides, but also a sense of belonging and community. Players are able to join the so-called ‚Äúguilds‚Äù in which they gather parties of 10 to 25 people to go on raids, etc. There is also an interesting statistic that proves people are able to stick to something more if they do it with a friend.
This experiment was done with people who practice fitness. You have 90% higher chances to finish a workout plan if you do it with a friend or a fitness trainer. Meanwhile, if you do it by yourself, you have a 50% chance rate to drop off. And this is also an essential aspect of gamification ‚Äî the community you build around it. Playing with friends is, sometimes, always better than alone.
It does not matter if the rewards we receive are not real. We don‚Äôt care about that. What we care about is the emotional reward which is real. World of Warcraft is an example of extreme-scale satisfying work. Players commit to this work environment for long periods of time. Or as McGonigal mentioned, the unemployment rate is 0% in World of Warcraft. And if you are able to put in place these type of principles of ‚Äúgamification‚Äù into your product, you nailed it.

I decided to see it as my career 7 months ago. I got my first intern job as a UX designer at Alibaba, one of the largest Chinese e-commerce companies, 4 months ago.
I am largely a self-taught UX designer. As soon as I commenced my first internship, I was bemused to see everything in the real ‚Äòcorporate‚Äô world being so different from what I had learned in the classroom.
Alibaba is a perfect playground for a UX newbie to explore how user experience design is implemented in the real industry. At Alibaba, I was able to experience various kinds of projects I desired. Special thanks to my leader who went out of her way to make sure me getting the most out of the internship. I put down every single thing I came across, reflected, learned and thought with during the 3-month internship.
Looking back, here are the three most valuable lessons I have learned, which makes me think differently than I did as a rookie. If you come from a non-academic background in UX design like me, these will help you better land at your first job.
I learnt it from the first project I participated in. The task was a small improvement of the sign-out process on a video sharing mobile app. I was told that the goal is to reduce the sign-out rate by reminding users of the membership benefits.
Yeah, cool! It is not a difficult task that I already have a rough idea. And there was even an existing measurement of my work! I was so excited about starting my first real project. I dived into it immediately and hammered out the solutions even one day early.
When I presented my solution to my supervisor, confidently, she asked me some questions:
It was the first and foremost mistake I came across. Fortunately, it happened so early.
The problem you are working on never happens in isolation. It is associated with business metrics, stakeholders‚Äô concerns, users‚Äô needs, the budget, the timeline, and so on. Unlike unfettered art, design is to solve problems within those constraints. So put your eyes on the context, make sure you have a comprehensive understanding of the task before starting work on it.
I have never thought thorough the tiny details when doing my coursework. However, in the same case as above, I was asked this several times by my supervisor and teammates.
Most of the time, I had solid reason behind a choice ‚Äî I chose red color because it means warning and we need to highlight it in this scenario. But other times, I just followed my intuition ‚Äî I just ran with the idea that comes to mind.
Never let tuition back up your decision. I think the white background just looks weird while the semitransparent one looks better. It is a perceptual feeling other than rational reason. For most cases, the tiny difference leads to quite another experience.
Design is not about how the interface looks. There must be a reason behind the weird looking. Go figure out what on the earth went wrong. In this case, here are some possibilities: the white background makes the content stand out, which does not match the information hierarchy; It violates the style guide of the site/app; etc.
I am not saying that looking good is not important. Actually, people react to aesthetics. But always remember that UX design cares more about the functionality good than the product looking good.
When I started my internship, I invested 80% of my time up front designing the perfect experience and improving my deliverables.
I was overwhelmed and frustrated when I presented my design to the whole team for the first time. The team consisted of product manager, marketer and engineers. It seems like everyone, as a potential user, had their own opinion towards the product.
We cannot do all of them in a month, could you prioritize them for us?
Fortunately, I worked with a bunch of professional, talented and experienced designers for two months. A valuable lesson I learnt from them is how to represent users and negotiate with other roles.
Senior designers prepared the potential questions beforehand according to who Is going to attend the meeting. Marketers may be overly concerned about the logo not being present on every page, whereas engineers may care more about whether it is really necessary to make the function so complicated.
More importantly, Senior designers‚Äô design process is never a lonely fight. They communicate with the stakeholders at an early stage during the design process to understand the technical constraints, test rough design or look for general feedback. When the team feels fully involved, the design becomes communal.
I was so fortunate to have the opportunity to meet and work with such a wonderful, supportive and friendly team. Alibaba is the perfect first station in my UX career path, where I had fun and learned a lot.

Thomas Le Corre|2.9K|8|https://medium.muz.li/apple-music-a-ux-ui-holistic-case-study-90579b294120?source=---------8---------------------|Apple Music: A UX/UI Holistic Case Study ‚Äì Muzli - Design Inspiration|"In-depth design proposal for a slightly better app.
Apple Music is relatively new on the music streaming scene. I subscribed from day one because A) it was integrated to the Apple ecosystem I was using everyday and B) I was conscious it was far from ideal but also curious to see how Apple would polish this and infuse their traditional design expertise.
And this is slowly happening, the mobile app is driving every design iteration as new waves of users keep flowing in but it still feels clunky sometimes, and the desktop app especially needs a solid update. So I‚Äôve been mainly focusing my attention on the Desktop app, but further down you will find some mobile screens as well.
I‚Äôve been using the app for a while now so this case study is mainly based on my own assumptions. However, about design and experience, I also talked to people and read many feedbacks.
A few common feedbacks:
Here‚Äôs what I tried to stick to:
Proposal: Make a clearer distinction between app navigation and music player. Keep the app navigation at the top and move the music player to the bottom. Both navigation and player would immediately benefit from the split and this would apply to all other screens.
Proposal: Kill the grey colour, kill the icons and re-arrange left-hand side navigation.
Proposal: Bring the logo back and use the vivid brand colours as highlights, clean everything white.
Proposal: Have two search bars showing, clearly labelled and positioned so I never have to use a toggle anymore.
Here‚Äôs the core page of the app I think, and so far the biggest missed opportunity.
Proposal: Introduce Music Genres Tags, top right as filters for the mood I‚Äôm in. If this was made for me, then let me take control of the content I see here. This page needs to be alive, I want to be able to make it mine, customise it, choose genres I‚Äôm into at a certain time and also be able to adjust as my tastes evolve.
Proposal: Remove ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù from this page and create a dedicated page to give the ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù feature a proper chance.
Proposal: Kill ‚ÄúRecently Played‚Äù, sort Suggested Playlist and Albums by genre and develop ‚ÄúHeavy Rotation‚Äù, providing stats about most played albums, songs, genres as well as a time dimension, by week, month or year.
Proposal: Introduce ‚ÄúBy Heart‚Äù, a silly little feature that values patience and help focus on knowing an artist‚Äôs discography really well. It would watch and digest how much you listen to something and reward you with funny data around it. This is completely gratuitous.
Proposal: Change name to ‚ÄúDiscover‚Äù for it feels slightly more adventurous than ‚ÄúBrowse‚Äù. Use taller tiles, larger space between elements, clearer navigation system and... less content.
I listen to AM Radios a lot, and again same problem occurs I always get to see what Apple wants to push: Beats & loads of commercial soup.
I‚Äôm not in control when what I want is be able to quickly find the 3 or 4 radios I keep on playing all the time. I also want to get some stuff out of my way forever.
Detail: I never know what‚Äôs playing on a radio unless I start playing it, I think showing current song upfront is a cheap and easy fix, would that happen through visuals, copy or both.
Proposal: Favorites left-hand side column, where I can put and arrange my most listened radios I keep coming back to everyday. Tags, so I can filter down what I want to see and eliminate all the irrelevant radios I never click. Sort small radios thumbnails together by genre.
If it was only me using the app, I‚Äôd remove the whole social media thing. ‚Äúconnect with artists‚Äù , ‚Äúfind friends‚Äù ... these overheard jargon lines almost upset me now, social media personal tolerance reached. Talking to people also confirms a majority actually feel this ubiquitous social media fatigue. There are just enough social networks out there and I don‚Äôt think I need another one in my life.
BUT, on another hand it‚Äôs 2019 tomorrow and, although it would be brave not to, I guess a worldwide company can‚Äôt do without sprinkling a bit of social powder. So let‚Äôs embrace a proper ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù section and make it wide, clean and as relevant as it can be.
Proposal: Friendship-focused left-hand side column consisting of ‚ÄúFriends Activity‚Äù and ‚ÄúTaste Match‚Äù to interact and meet people you get along well in music. Bigger blocks for Artists news, more room for copy, a dedicated space for visual communication or media, a classic like/comment area and a quick access to the latest album, bottom left. A ‚ÄúGhost Mode‚Äù for the ones who want to stay under the radar.
Drag and drop any module within a section, rearrange them the way you want. This option felt like the simplest way to a more user-centric app.
I would love this to happen, that would make me feel in control and also contribute to building a more organic and flexible app, evolving with the user‚Äôs mood and taste.

Justin Baker|1K|7|https://hackernoon.com/design-psychology-gestalt-driven-ux-64ac01cd257a?source=---------9---------------------|Gestalt-Driven UX: The Patterns That Drive Our World|"It‚Äôs incredible to think where we‚Äôve come in the last 30 years. We‚Äôve digitized much of our daily lives, including our interactions with each other and the tangible world.
As such, we‚Äôve had to evolve and adapt how we consume technology: touch, voice, sound... taste? We‚Äôre having to transact increasingly complex information with more things with less time. It truly is chaos! Or.. at least it would be if we didn‚Äôt apply gestalt psychology to our interactive experiences.
Let‚Äôs take a look at this gourmet dessert.
Looks tasty? I‚Äôm honestly not sure exactly what it is, but it‚Äôs on the same plate right? So it must go together!
But, what if I take the plate away and the ingredients just lay on the table in the same exact position? Can the restaurant-goer still infer that this is one unified dish? Why or why not? What would I need to do to unify the dish so that the restaurant-goer knows what goes together? When I take away explicit boundaries, how does my brain know how to group things together?
This is the essence of gestalt psychology.
Gestalt psychology originated in the 1920‚Äôs and was first applied to the visual world in the 30‚Äôs and 40's. It attempts to understand how humans perceive, acquire, and maintain information in an inherently chaotic world. In essence, it is the science behind pattern perception: how we subconsciously and consciously group information to infer additional meaning. It‚Äôs how we recognize patterns and simplify the complex.
Now, let‚Äôs dig into how it works and how we can harness gestaltism to build more delightful experiences.
Over the years, new tenets have been added to gestaltism. We‚Äôll cover a few of the main ones that you‚Äôve most likely applied in your day-to-day work without even knowing it.
We perceive objects that are near each other as similar. Hence, we tend to group things that are proximal, even if they are different. This works so long as that proximate grouping has a defined boundary, either explicitly outlined or with margin/padding.
We perceive objects that share visual characteristics (size, color, texture, dimension, shape, or orientation) as belonging together. These objects do not need to be adjacent or near each other, but will typically consistently share one or more characteristics so as to be visually distinct from other object groupings. Basically, when we look at objects that are similar to each other, we tend to group them together.
Our eyes can visually separate objects from their backgrounds in either a stable, reversible, or ambiguous way. We can also think of this as a separation between foreground and background.
We perceive objects that are symmetrical with each other as more likely to be grouped together than objects that are not symmetrical with each other. We can infer patterns based on symmetry and apply those patterns to we group information. We can also make inferences that information contained within those symmetrical patterns share common attributes.
Our brains will perceive objects and figures in their complete form even if part of that object is missing or not explicitly apparent. We‚Äôll see closure often applied to iconography, where our brains are tasked with making a quick sensory interpretation of an object.
We determine the relationship between objects by following inherent visual patterns: lines, curves, waves, and sequences. We often see continuity applied with image slideshows or with apps where part of a feature/element is cut off by the viewport.
We will group objects together that are moving or point in the same direction. We unify these objects because we perceive them as having a singular stimulus. If you‚Äôve ever used a step by step tutorial wizard, you will infer that each step is sequential because of similarities in pattern and direction.
We prefer to see objects that periodically repeat. Think of this as a carpet pattern that may look complex, but exudes completeness when it covers the entirety of the floor. We can infer patterns based on complex trends, so long as the patterns are relatively repeatable and trend directionally over time.
The way we perceive the world does not always match the real world. We develop perceptual hypotheses. Hence, gestalt principles underpin the educated guesses we make when interpreting sensory information.
Consider your users. How are they developing their hypotheses? What is underpinning their sensory interpretation? The way we see the world is informed by numerous factors: our empirical experience, personality, upbringing, and expectations. These inform our perceptual baseline: the context that frames how we perceive and interact with our world.
Here are some UX tips that can help:
Even for existing experiences, you can remove the details and just focus on general areas and patterns. What happens if you move elements around? What happens if you add a new feature? What happens if you modify your layout? Can your users understand the inherent patterns and relationships within your product if you removed all the detail?
A higher level sensory perspective can help you create an experience that meshes with a user‚Äôs cognitive assumptions and hypotheses ‚Äî delivering truly delightful UX.

This article focuses on the common dos and don‚Äôts of form design. Keep in mind that these are general guideline and there are exceptions to every rule.
Omit optional fields and think of other ways to collect data. Always ask yourself if the question can be inferred, postponed, or completely excluded.
Data entry is increasingly automated. For example, mobile and wearable devices collect large amounts of data without the user‚Äôs conscious awareness. Think of ways you can leverage social, conversational UI, SMS, email, voice, OCR, location, fingerprint, biometric, etc.
Life is short. No one wants to fill out a form. Be conversational. Be funny. Gradually engage. Do the unexpected. It is the role of the designer to express their company‚Äôs brand to elicit an emotional reaction. If done correctly, it will increase completion rates.

Maybe the company you work for doesn‚Äôt have a full-time designer and you need to implement the UI for a new feature on your own. Or maybe you‚Äôre hacking on a side-project and you want it to look better than yet-another-Bootstrap-site.
It‚Äôs easy to throw your hands up and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be able to make this look good, I‚Äôm not an artist!‚Äù but it turns out there are a ton of tricks you can use to level up your work that don‚Äôt require a background in graphic design.
Here are seven simple ideas you can use to improve your designs today.
A common mistake when styling UI text is relying too much on font size to control your hierarchy.
‚ÄúIs this text important? Let‚Äôs make it bigger.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs this text secondary? Let‚Äôs make it smaller.‚Äù
Instead of leaving all of the heavy lifting to font size alone, try using color or font weight to do the same job.
‚ÄúIs this text important? Let‚Äôs make it bolder.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs this text secondary? Let‚Äôs use a lighter color.‚Äù
Try and stick to two or three colors:
Similarly, two font weights is usually enough for UI work:
Stay away from font weights under 400 for UI work; they can work for large headings but are too hard to read at smaller sizes. If you‚Äôre considering using a lighter weight to de-emphasize some text, use a lighter color or smaller font size instead.
Making text a lighter grey is a great way to de-emphasize it on white backgrounds, but it doesn‚Äôt look so great on colored backgrounds.
That‚Äôs because the effect we‚Äôre actually seeing with grey on white is reduced contrast.
Making the text closer to the background color is what actually helps create hierarchy, not making it light grey.
There are two ways you can reduce contrast when working with colorful backgrounds:
Use white text and lower the opacity. This lets the background color bleed through a bit, de-emphasizing the text in a way that doesn‚Äôt clash with the background.
This works better than reducing the opacity when your background is an image or pattern, or when reducing the opacity makes the text feel too dull or washed out.
Choose a color that‚Äôs the same hue as the background, adjusting saturation and lightness until it looks right to you.
Instead of using large blur and spread values to make box shadows more noticeable, add a vertical offset.
It looks a lot more natural because it simulates a light source shining down from above like we‚Äôre used to seeing in the real world.
This applies to inset shadows like you might use on wells or form inputs too:
If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about shadow design, the Material Design Guidelines are a fantastic primer.
When you need to create separation between two elements, try to resist immediately reaching for a border.
While borders are a great way to distinguish two elements from one another, they aren‚Äôt the only way, and using too many of them can make your design feel busy and cluttered.
The next time you find yourself reaching for a border, try one of these ideas instead:
Box shadows do a great job of outlining an element like a border would, but can be more subtle and accomplish the same goal without being as distracting.
Giving adjacent elements slightly different background colors is usually all you need to create distinction between them. If you‚Äôre already using different background colors in addition to a border, try removing the border; you might not need it.
What better way to create separation between elements than to simply increase the separation? Spacing things further apart is a great way to create distinction between groups of elements without introducing any new UI at all.
If you‚Äôre designing something that could use some large icons (like maybe the ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù section of a landing page), you might instinctively grab a free icon set like Font Awesome or Zondicons and bump up the size until they fit your needs.
They‚Äôre vector images after all, so the quality isn‚Äôt going to suffer if you increase the size right?
While it‚Äôs true that vector images won‚Äôt degrade in quality when you increase their size, icons that were drawn at 16‚Äì24px are never going to look very professional when you blow them up to 3x or 4x their intended size. They lack detail, and always feel disproportionately ‚Äúchunky‚Äù.
If small icons are all you‚Äôve got, try enclosing them inside another shape and giving the shape a background color:
This lets you keep the actual icon closer to its intended size, while still filling the larger space.
If you have the budget, you could also use a premium icon set designed to be used at larger sizes, like Heroicons or Iconic.
If you‚Äôre not a graphic designer, how do you add that dash of visual flair to your UI that other designs get from beautiful photography or colorful illustrations?
One simple trick that can make a big difference is to add colorful accent borders to parts of your interface that would otherwise feel a bit bland.
For example, along the side of an alert message:
...or to highlight active navigation items:
...or even across the top of your entire layout:
It doesn‚Äôt take any graphic design talent to add a colored rectangle to your UI, and it can go a long way towards making your site feel more ‚Äúdesigned.‚Äù
Have a hard time picking colors? Try choosing from a constrained palette like Dribbble‚Äôs color search to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the endless possibilities of a traditional color picker.
When there are multiple actions a user can take on a page, it‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of designing those actions based purely on semantics.
Frameworks like Bootstrap sort of encourage this by giving you a menu of semantic styles to choose from whenever you‚Äôre adding a new button:
‚ÄúIs this a positive action? Make the button green.‚Äù
‚ÄúDoes this delete data? Make the button red.‚Äù
Semantics are an important part of button design, but there‚Äôs a more important dimension that‚Äôs commonly forgotten: hierarchy.
Every action on a page sits somewhere in a pyramid of importance. Most pages only have one true primary action, a couple of less important secondary actions, and a few seldom used tertiary actions.
When designing these actions, it‚Äôs important to communicate their place in the hierarchy.
‚ÄúWhat about destructive actions, shouldn‚Äôt they always be red?‚Äù
Not necessarily! If the destructive action isn‚Äôt the primary action on the page, it might be better to give it a secondary or tertiary button treatment.
Save the big, red, and bold styling for when that negative action actually is the primary action in the interface, like in a confirmation dialog:

Over the last 5 years, it has been my privilege to coach and mentor UX & UI designers in over 40 countries, and at hundreds of the top brands and design consultancies through my workshops and tutorials on UI Animation.
After over fifteen years studying motion in user interfaces, I have come to the conclusion that there are 12 specific opportunities to support usability in your UX projects using motion.
I call these opportunities ‚ÄòThe 12 Principles of UX in Motion,‚Äô and they can be stacked and combined synergistically in a myriad of innovative ways.
I‚Äôve broken the manifesto into 5 parts:
As a quick plug, if you are interested in having me lead a motion and usability workshop for your team, click here for more info: https://uxinmotion.net/creating-usability-with-motion-workshop/
Because the topic of motion in user interfaces is mostly understood by designers to be ‚ÄòUI Animation‚Äô‚Äîwhich it is not ‚Äî I feel like I need to create a bit of context before we jump into the 12 Principles.
‚ÄòUI Animation‚Äô is typically thought of by designers as something that makes the user experience more delightful, but overall doesn‚Äôt add much value. Thus, UI Animation is often treated like the red-headed stepchild of UX (apologies to red-headed stepchildren everywhere). If at all, it usually comes at the end, as a final lipstick pass.
Additionally, motion in the context of user interfaces has understandably been held to be under the domain of Disney‚Äôs 12 Principles of Animation, something I argue against in my article ‚ÄòUI Animation Principles ‚Äî Disney is Dead.‚Äô
In my manifesto, I will be making the case that UI Animation is to the ‚Äò12 UX in Motion Principles‚Äô as construction is to architecture.
By this I mean, that while a structure needs to be physically built to exist (requiring construction), the guiding hand which determines what gets built comes from the domain of Principles.
Animation is all about tools. Principles are the practical application of ideas that guide the usage of tools and as such, Principles provide high leverage opportunities for designers.
What most designers think of as ‚ÄòUI Animation‚Äô is in fact the execution of a higher modality of design: the temporal behavior of interface objects during realtime and non-realtime events.
At this juncture, it is important to distinguish between ‚Äòstate‚Äô and ‚Äòact.‚Äô The state of something in UX is fundamentally static, like a design comp. The act of something in UX is fundamentally temporal, and motion based. An object can be in the state of being masked or it can be in the act of being masked. If it is the latter, we know that motion is involved and in a way that could support usability.
Additionally, all temporal aspects of interaction can be thought of as happening in realtime or non-realtime. Realtime means that the user is directly interacting with the objects in the user interface. Non-realtime means that the object behavior is post-interactive: it occurs after a user action, and is transitional.
This is an important distinction.
Realtime interactions can also be thought of as ‚Äòdirect manipulation,‚Äô in that the user is interacting with the interface objects directly and immediately. The behavior of the interface is happening as the user is using it.
Non-realtime interactions happen only after input from the user and have the effect of briefly locking the user out of the user experience until the transition completes.
These distinctions will give us leverage as we continue our journey into the world of the 12 Principles of UX in Motion.
These four pillars represent the four ways where the temporal behavior of user experiences supports usability.
Expectation fall into two areas ‚Äî how users perceive what an object is, and how it behaves. Another way of saying this is that as designers, we want to minimize the gap between what the user expects, and what they experience.
Continuity speaks both to the user flow and to the ‚Äòconsistency‚Äô of the user experience. Continuity can be thought of in terms of ‚Äòintra-continuity‚Äô ‚Äî the continuity within a scene, and ‚Äòinter-continuity‚Äô ‚Äî the continuity within a series of scenes that make up the total user experience.
Narrative is the linear progression of events in the user experience that results in a temporal/spatial framework. This can be thought of as the series of discreet moments and events that connect together throughout the user experience.
Relationship refers to the spatial, temporal, and hierarchal representations between interface objects that guide user understanding and decision making.
Tyler Waye says it as good as any when he writes, ‚ÄúPrinciples... are the underlying premises and rules of function giving rise to any number of techniques. These elements remain consistent, no matter what is happening.‚Äù It bears repeating that Principles are agnostic of design.
From there, we can imagine a hierarchy with Principles at the top, Techniques further down, Properties below that, and Values at the bottom.
Techniques can be thought of as the various and unlimited executions of Principles and/or combination of Principles. I think of technique as akin to ‚Äòstyle.‚Äô
Properties are the specific object parameters that are being animated to create the technique. These include (and are not limited to) position, opacity, scale, rotation, anchor point, color, stroke-width, shape, etc.
Values are the actual numeric property values that vary over time to create what we call ‚Äòanimation.‚Äô
So to land the plane here (and jumping ahead a bit), we could say that a hypothetical UI animation reference is using the Obscuration Principle with a ‚Äòblurred glass‚Äô Technique that affects the Blur and Opacity Properties at a Value of 25px and 70% respectively.
Now we have some tools to work with. And more importantly, these linguistic tools are agnostic of any specific prototyping tool.
Easing and Offset & Delay relate to timing. Parenting relates to object relationship. Transformation, Value Change, Masking, Overlay, and Cloning all relate to object continuity. Parallax relate to temporal hierarchy. Obscuration, Dimensionality and Dolly & Zoom both relate to spatial continuity.
Object behavior aligns with user expectations when temporal events occur.
All interface objects exhibiting temporal behavior (whether realtime or non-realtime), ease. Easing creates and reinforces the ‚Äònaturalism‚Äô inherent in the seamlessness of user experiences, and creates a sense of continuity when objects behave as users expect them to. Incidentally, Disney refers to this as ‚ÄòSlow In and Slow Out.‚Äô
The example on the left has linear motion and looks ‚Äòbad.‚Äô The first example up top has eased motion and looks ‚Äògood.‚Äô All three above examples have the exact number of frames and take place over the exact same amount of time. The only difference is in their easing.
As designers concerned with usability, we need to require of ourselves rigor and inquire, aside from aesthetics, which example supports usability more?
The case I am presenting here is that a certain degree of skeuomorphism is inherent in easing. You can imagine an ‚Äòeasing gradient‚Äô wherein behaviors that fall outside user expectations result in less usable interactions. In the case of properly eased motion, users experience the motion itself as seamless and largely invisible ‚Äî which is a good thing in that it is non-distracting. Linear motion is visibly obvious and feels somehow off, unfinished, and jarring, and distracting.
Now I‚Äôm going to completely contradict myself here and talk about the example on the right. The motion isn‚Äôt seamless. In fact, it has a ‚Äòdesigned‚Äô feel to it. We notice how the object lands. It feels different, yet it still feels more ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô than the example with linear motion.
Can you employ easing and still have it not support (or worse case undermine) usability? The answer is yes, and there are several ways. One way is timing. If your timing is too slow (mushy to borrow from Pasquele), or too fast, you can break expectation and distract user attention. Similarly, if your easing is misaligned with the brand or overall experience, this can also negatively impact expectation and seamlessness.
What I want to open you to is a world of opportunity when it comes to eased motion. There are literally an infinite number of ‚Äòeasings‚Äô that you as a designer can create and implement in your projects. All of these easings have their own expectation response they trigger in users.
To summarize: when to use easing? Always.
You can learn more on my easing hypothesis in my article, ‚ÄòThe irony of usability and linear motion.‚Äô
Defines object relationships and hierarchies when introducing new elements and scenes.
Offset & Delay is the second of only two UX in Motion Principles that is influenced by Disney‚Äôs Animation Principles, in this case from ‚ÄòFollow Through and Overlapping Action.‚Äô
It is important to note, however, that the implementation, while similar in execution, differs in purpose and outcome. While Disney‚Äôs Principles result in ‚Äòmore appealing animations,‚Äô the UI Animation Principles result in more usable experiences.
The utility of this principle is that it pre-consciously sets the user up for success by ‚Äòtelling‚Äô the user something about the nature of the objects in the interface. The narrative in the above reference is that the top two objects are united and the bottom object is separate. Perhaps the top two objects could be a non-interactive image and text, while the bottom object is a button.
Even before the user registers what these objects are, the designer has already communicated to her‚Äîthrough motion ‚Äî that the objects are somehow ‚Äòseparate.‚Äô This is extremely powerful.
In the above example, the floating action button (FAB) transforms into header navigation elements comprised of three buttons. Because the buttons are ‚Äòoffset‚Äô from each other temporally, they end up supporting usability through their ‚Äòseparateness.‚Äô Said differently, the designer is using time itself to say ‚Äî even before the user registers what the objects are ‚Äî that the objects are separate. This has the effect of telling the user, completely independent from the visual design, part of the nature of the objects in the interface.
To better show you how this works, I‚Äôll show you an example that breaks the Offset & Delay Principle.
In the above example, the static visual design tells us that there are icons over a background. The presumption is that the icons are all separate from each other and do different things. However, the motion contradicts this.
Temporally, the icons are grouped into rows and behave like a single object. Their titles are likewise grouped into rows, and also behave like a single object. The motion is telling the user something other than what her eyes see. In this case, we can say that the temporal behavior of the objects in the interface are not supporting usability.
Creates spatial and temporal hierarchal relationships when interacting with multiple objects.
Parenting is a powerful Principle that ‚Äòrelates‚Äô objects in the user interface. In the above example, the ‚Äòscale‚Äô and ‚Äòposition‚Äô property of the top or ‚Äòchild‚Äô object is parented to the ‚Äòposition‚Äô property of the bottom or ‚Äòparent‚Äô object.
Parenting is the linking of object properties to other object properties. This creates object relationships and hierarchies in ways that support usability.
Parenting also allows designers to better coordinate temporal events in the user interface, while communicating to users the nature of the object relationships.
Recall that object Properties include the following ‚Äî Scale, Opacity, Position, Rotation, Shape, Color, Value, etc. Any of these Properties can be linked to any other Properties to create synergistic moments in the User Experience.
In this above left example, the ‚Äòy-axis‚Äô Property of the ‚Äòface‚Äô element is the ‚Äòchild‚Äô to the ‚Äòx-axis‚Äô Property of the round indicator parent. When the round indicator element moves along the horizontal axis, its ‚Äòchild‚Äô element moves along with it horizontally and vertically (while being Masked ‚Äî another Principle).
The result is a hierarchal temporal narrative framework that occurs all at the same time. Of note is that the ‚Äòfaces‚Äô object works as a series of ‚Äòlockups‚Äô in that, at each number, the ‚Äòface‚Äô is fully and not partially visible. The user experiences this seamlessly, though we can make the claim there is a subtle ‚Äòusability cheat‚Äô in this example.
Parenting functions best as a ‚Äòrealtime‚Äô interaction. As the user directly manipulates the interface objects, the designer communicates to the user ‚Äî via motion ‚Äî how the objects are linked, and the relationship between them.
Parenting occurs in 3 forms: ‚Äòdirect parenting‚Äô (see above two examples, ‚Äòdelayed parenting,‚Äô and ‚Äòinverse parenting,‚Äô see below).
Creates a continuous state of narrative flow when object utility changes.
Much has already been written about the UX in Motion Principle ‚Äòtransformation.‚Äô In some ways, it is the most obvious and penetrable of the animation principles.
Transformation is the most discernible, largely because it stands out. A ‚Äòsubmit‚Äô button changing shape to become a radial progress bar and finally changing shape again to become a confirmation check mark is something that we notice. It grabs our attention, tells a story, and has completion.
What Transformation does is seamlessly transition the user through the different UX states or ‚Äòis‚Äôs‚Äô (as in this is a button, this is a radial progress bar, this is a check mark) which eventually result in a desired outcome. The user has been drawn through these functional spaces to the ultimate destination.
Transformation has the effect of ‚Äòchunking‚Äô cognitively separate key moments in the user experience into a seamless and continuous series of events. This seamlessness results in better user awareness, retention, and followthrough.
Creates a dynamic and continuous narrative relationship when value subject changes.
Text based interface objects, that is to say numbers and text, can change their values. This is one of those ‚Äòelusive obvious‚Äô concepts.
Text and number changes are so common that they pass us by without us bringing to them distinction and rigor to assess their role in supporting usability
So what is the user experiencing when values change? In user experiences, the 12 UX in Motion Principles are opportunities to support usability. The three opportunities here are to connect the user to the reality behind the data, the concept of agency, and to the dynamic nature of the values themselves.
Let‚Äôs look at the example of a user dashboard.
When value based interface objects load with no ‚Äòvalue change,‚Äô what this conveys to the user is that the numbers are static objects. They‚Äôre like painted signs displaying a speed limit of 55 mph.
The numbers and values are representations of things that are happening in reality. That reality could be time, income, game scores, business metrics, fitness tracking, etc. What we are distinguishing through motion is that the ‚Äòvalue subject‚Äô is dynamic and the values are reflecting something from that dynamic value set.
Not only does this relationship get lost with static objects comprised visually of values, but another deeper opportunity is also lost.
When we employ representations of dynamic systems in the form of motion based values, it activates a sort of ‚Äòneurofeedback.‚Äô Users, grasping the dynamic nature of their data can now be cause in altering those values and are empowered to become agents. When the values are static, there is less connection to the reality behind the values, and users lose their agency.
The Value Change Principle can occur both in realtime and non-realtime events. In realtime events, the user is interacting with the objects to change values. In non-realtime events, such as loaders and transitions, the values change without user input to reflect a dynamic narrative.
Creates continuity in an interface object or object group when utility is determined by which part of the object or group is revealed or concealed.
The act of masking asking can be thought of as a relationship between the shape of the object and it‚Äôs utility.
Because designers are familiar with ‚Äòmasking‚Äô in the context of static design, it behooves us to bring distinction to the UX in Motion Principle ‚ÄòMasking‚Äô as it occurs in time, as an act, and not as a state.
Through the temporal use of revealing and concealing regions of an object, utility transitions in a continuous and seamless way. This also has the effect of preserving narrative flow.
In the above example, the header image changes bounding shape and position but not the content, and becomes an album. This has the effect of changing what the object is, while preserving the content within the mask ‚Äî a fairly neat trick. This occurs in non-realtime, as a transition, that is activated after a user takes an action.
Remember, UI Animation Principles occur temporally and support usability through continuity, narrative, relationship, and expectation. In the above reference, while the object itself remains unchanged, it also has boundary and location, and these two factors determine what the object is.
Creates narrative and object spatial relationship in visual flatland when layered objects are location dependent.
Overlay supports usability by allowing users to utilize flatland ordering properties to overcome a lack of non-spatial hierarchies.
To land the plane a bit, Overlay allows designers to use motion to communicate location dependent objects that exist behind or in front of others in non 3D space.
In the example on the left, the foreground object slides to the right to reveal the location of additional background objects. In the example on the right, the entire scene slides down to reveal additional content and options (while using the Offset & Delay Principle to communicate the individuality of the photo objects).
To a certain degree, as designers, the idea of ‚Äòlayers‚Äô is so obvious as to be self-evident. We design with layers and the concept of layers are deeply internalized. However, we must be careful to distinguish between the process of ‚Äòmaking‚Äô verses ‚Äòusing.‚Äô
As designers who are continually engaged in the process of ‚Äòmaking,‚Äô we are intimately familiar with all of the pieces of the object (including the hidden pieces) we are designing. As a user, however, those non visible pieces are by definition and practice, hidden both visually and cognitively.
The Overlay Principle allows designers to communicate relationship between ‚Äòz-axis‚Äô positioned layers and in so doing, promote spatial orientation to their users.
Creates continuity, relationship and narrative, when new objects originate and depart.
When new objects are created in current scenes (and from current objects), it is important to narratively account for their appearance. In this manifesto, I argue forcefully for the importance of creating a narrative framework for object origin and departure. Simple opacity fades tend to not achieve this result. Masking, Cloning, and Dimensionality are three usability based approaches to produce strong narratives.
In the above three examples, new objects are created from existing hero objects during the time the user‚Äôs attention is focused on those objects. This two fold approach ‚Äî the directing of attention, and then leading the eye through the creation of a cloned new object ‚Äî has the strong effect of communicating a clear and unambiguous chain of events: that action ‚Äòx‚Äô has the result ‚Äòy‚Äô of the creation of new child objects.
Allows users to spatially orient themselves in relationship to objects or scenes not in the primary visual hierarchy.
Similar to the UX in Motion Principles of Masking, Obscuration lives as both a static and temporal phenomena.
This can be confusing to designers who don‚Äôt have experience thinking temporally ‚Äî that is, the moments between moments. Designers typically design screen to screen or task to task. Think of Obscuration as the act of being obscured and not the state of being obscured. A static design represents the state of being obscured. Introducing time gives us the act of an object being obscured.
From the above two examples, we can see that obscuration, which looks like transparent objects or overlays, is also a temporal interaction involving multiple properties in time.
Various common techniques of this involve blur effects and a lessoning of overall object transparency. The user is made aware of an additional non primary context that she is operating in ‚Äî that there is another world, as it were, ‚Äòbehind‚Äô her primary object hierarchy.
Obscuration allows designers to compensate for a single unified field of view, or ‚Äòobjective view,‚Äô in user experiences.
Creates spatial hierarchy in visual flatland when users scroll.
‚ÄòParallax,‚Äô as a UX in Motion Principle describes different interface objects moving at different rates.
Parallax allows user to focus on primary actions and content while maintaining design integrity. Background elements ‚Äòrecede‚Äô perceptually and cognitively for the user during a Parallax event. Designers can use Parallax to separate out immediacy content from ambient or supportive content.
The effect this has on the user, is to clearly define for the duration of the interaction, the various object relationships. Foreground objects, or objects that move ‚Äòquicker‚Äô appear to the user as ‚Äòcloser.‚Äô Likewise, background objects or objects that move ‚Äòslower‚Äô are perceived as being ‚Äòfurther away.‚Äô
Designers can create these relationships, using time itself, to tell the user what objects in the interface are higher priority. Therefore it makes sense to push background or non-interactive elements further ‚Äòback.‚Äô
Not only does the user perceive the interface objects as now having a hierarchy beyond that which is determined in the visual design, but this hierarchy can now be leveraged into having the user grasp the nature of the user experience before being consciously aware of the design/content.
Provides a spatial narrative framework when new objects originate and depart.
Critical to User Experiences is the phenomenon of continuity as well as the sense of location.
Dimensionality provides a powerful way to overcome the flatland non-logic of User Experiences.
Humans are remarkably adept at using spatial frameworks to navigate both in the real world and in digital experiences. Providing spatial origin and departure references helps reinforce mental models of where users are in the UX.
Additionally, the Dimensionality Principle overcomes the layering paradox in visual flatland wherein objects lacking depth exist on the same plane but occur as ‚Äòin front of‚Äô or ‚Äòbehind‚Äô other objects.
Dimensionality presents itself in three ways ‚Äî Origami Dimensionality, Floating Dimensionality, and Object Dimensionality.
Origami Dimensionality can be thought of in terms of ‚Äòfolding‚Äô or ‚Äòhinged‚Äô three dimensional interface objects.
Because multiple objects are combined into ‚Äòorigami‚Äô structures, the hidden objects still can be said to ‚Äòexist,‚Äô spatially even though they are not visible. This effectively renders the User Experience as a continuous spatial event that the user navigates and creates an operating context both in the interaction model itself, and in the temporal behavior of the interface objects themselves.
Floating Dimensionality gives interface objects a spatial origin and departure, making the interaction models intuitive and highly narrative.
In the above example, Dimensionality is achieved through the use of 3D ‚Äòcards.‚Äô This provides a strong narrative framework that supports the visual design. The narrative is extended by ‚Äòflipping‚Äô the cards to access additional content and interactivity. Dimensionality can be a powerful way to introduce new elements in ways that minimize abruptness.
Object Dimensionality results in dimensional objects with true depth and form.
Here, multiple 2D layers are arranged in 3D space to form true dimensional objects. Their dimensionality is revealed during realtime and non-realtime transitional moments. The utility of Object Dimensionality is that users develop a keen awareness of object utility based on non-visible spatial locations.
Preserves continuity and spatial narrative when navigating interface objects and spaces.
Dolly and Zoom are filmic concepts referring to the movement of objects relevant to the camera, and the size of the image itself in the frame smoothly changing from a long shot to a close up shot (or vice versa).
In certain contexts, it is impossible to tell if an object is zooming, if it is moving towards the camera in 3D space, or if the camera is moving towards the object in 3D space (see below references). The below three examples illustrate the possible scenarios.
As such, it is appropriate to treat the instances of ‚Äòdollying‚Äô and ‚Äòzooming‚Äô as separate but similar in that they involve continuous element and scenic transformations, and meet the requirements of the UX in Motion Principles: they support usability through motion.
Dolly is a film term and applies to camera movement either toward or away from a subject (it also applies to horizontal ‚Äòtracking‚Äô movement as well, but is less relevant in a usability context).
Spatially in UX, this motion could refer either to a change in the viewers perspective, or to the perspective remaining static while the object changes position. The Dolly Principle supports usability through continuity and narrative, seamlessly transitioning between interface objects and destinations. Dolly can also incorporate the Dimensionality Principle, resulting in a more spatial experience, more depth, and communicating to the user additional areas or content that is ‚Äòin front‚Äô or ‚Äòbehind‚Äô the current view.
Zoom refers to events where neither the perspective nor the object is moving spatially, but rather the object itself is scaling (or our view of it is decreasing, resulting in the image enlarging). This communicates to the viewer that additional interface objects are ‚Äòinside‚Äô other objects or scenes.
This allows for seamless transitions ‚Äî both realtime and non-realtime ‚Äî that support usability. This seamlessness employed in the Dolly & Zoom Principle is quite powerful when it comes to creating spatial mental models.

Jeff Davidson|33K|8|https://blog.prototypr.io/the-most-important-rule-in-ux-design-that-everyone-breaks-1c1cb188931?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|The Most Important Rule in UX Design that Everyone Breaks|"There is one principle of organization that every human should adhere to, particularly people who design products. Day after day, I see companies break this rule, and it is 100% of the time to their detriment. In this article I will explain what that rule is, and what it means to product and service design. I‚Äôll also raise the possible implications of this phenomenon on organizational management, collaboration, and general performance. The psychological phenomenon I will be discussing in this article is known as Miller‚Äôs Law. Rather than just tell you what Miller‚Äôs Law is, I ask you to take part in this exercise for a more immersive learning lesson.
Read the italicized instructions before starting. Grab a pen and paper. This is an exercise where you will try to recall words you‚Äôve just read, off memory.
Below is a list of 20 words. Read them to comprehension , and try to memorize as many as possible. Try to keep the words ‚Äòin your head‚Äô. Do not write the words. Spend about a minute. After you are done reading, scroll down until you see the word ‚ÄòSTOP‚Äô. Then, read step 2.
STOP < ¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑
Now, use your pen and paper to write down as many words as you can remember from the list. Think hard, but do not scroll back up to view the words. If you scroll up, the experiment is ruined. Give yourself about half a minute...Once you have finished writing the words you tried to recall, scroll back up and check how many you got right.
If you are like the vast majority of human beings, you will have remembered 5‚Äì9 of the words. Hundreds of experiments prove universality of this limitation on memory. When I first discovered this phenomenon, I knew it had huge implications on product design, because of the degree to which this limitation affects day to day tasks. This capacity for keeping ~7 bits of information ‚Äòin the head‚Äô short term, is known as Miller‚Äôs Law.
In 1956 there was a paper written that became one of the most highly cited papers in psychology. Titled, The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information, it was published in 1956 by the cognitive psychologist George A. Miller of Princeton University‚Äôs Department of Psychology in Psychological Review. The crux of the paper suggests that the number of perceptual ‚Äòchunks‚Äô an average human can hold in working memory (a component of short-term memory) is 7 ¬± 2. This is frequently referred to as Miller‚Äôs law. Here is a summary of the article, sourced from wikipedia:
Moreover, the human mind can remember ~7 bits of information when completing a task that requires cognitive effort. This is critical, because humans are constantly performing tasks, and trying to juggle various stimuli in the mind when doing so. One of the key concepts behind Miller‚Äôs Law is ‚Äòchunking‚Äô, which basically means assembling various bits of information into a cohesive gestalt. For example, the word ¬∑ p e n c i l ¬∑ is actually a ‚Äòchunk‚Äô of letters, organized into a perceptual gestalt. If the letters were rearranged ¬∑ c n l i p e ¬∑ it would be six separate chunks of information. Chunking is a critical element of information organization, and is the basis for our UX and organizational rule.
Always organize elements of information in categories no larger than 9, but preferably ~5 chunks.
The more chunks of information you add to an ‚Äòinterface‚Äô, the more difficult it becomes to ‚Äòwork‚Äô, using the information at hand. This is especially critical for first time users, because they haven‚Äôt had the ‚Äòpractice‚Äô needed to encode the interface into long term memory, or, for the behaviour to become habitual. I constantly see this rule being broken by giants like Facebook, Google, and Wordpress. Don‚Äôt even get me started on automobile interface design. The ~5 bit chunk rule also compliments minimalism as a rigorous design philosophy. To expound, due to the limitations of working memory, as a product becomes more feature-full it inevitably becomes more difficult to use, because the user has to manage more information while operating the product. This makes good information design so critical.
Millers Law also highlights the importance of foresight and proper planning in the design process, because as you add more features to a product ‚Äî your interface must be able to accommodate those new features without breaking the visual foundation of what you built. Rebuilding a foundation takes immense time and resources.
Another perceptual phenomenon observed in relation to Miller‚Äôs Law is known as the primacy, and recency effect. These terms are used respectively to describe how we remember items sensed at the beginning and end of an experience, more than ones in the middle. For example, if I were to show you a list of words, you would more likely remember the words at the beginning of the list, and the end. This is also known as the serial position effect. From wikipedia:
This observation raises huge questions in business and design. If people remember more at the beginning and end of an experience, how do we enhance the positives, and mitigate the negatives at these respective times? When does an experience truly begin and end? Should we be organizing more important elements at the beginning and end of lists due to their increased retention? These are all valid questions that UX designers and executives should ask when inventing or developing their product.
Millers Law can be applied to any aspect of your life that involves performing a mildly complex task. By reducing the amount of elements in your reach/access ‚Äî and keeping them organized by relevant chunks not exceeding 9 bits, your brain will be able to remember exactly where things are so you can access its functionality. When lists of items grow too large, they become very difficult to mentally map them, requiring the user to do more cumbersome searching.
The adherence to Miller‚Äôs Law is especially relevant in the light of lean methodologies and recent trends in tech and UX. Users want and need a trial before they purchase something ‚Äî it‚Äôs that simple. If they don‚Äôt experience the value within the first day or week of using it ‚Äî they won‚Äôt buy. Since new users do not have lengthly time to learn where everything is ‚Äî information design needs to be planned and well thought out before development happens.
We live in a world with an exponentially increasing amount of information. By not organizing it properly, or eliminating some completely, it ultimately degrades our ability to complete critical tasks for the purposes of survival (navigation/gaining income). That is why it‚Äôs so useful to omit items, products, and services from your life that aren‚Äôt giving a quality return on investment. This falls in line with the Pareto principle, the idea that 80% of your outcomes comes from 20% of your investments. Are you juggling too many tasks per day to be efficient? Is your team using too many tools to collaborate? Do you have too many members on your team? Are you overloading your new employees with information, leading to confusion?
Millers law teaches us that humans have a finite amount of information they can process, and that information overload will lead to distraction that negatively affects performance. Companies should look for ways to organize information in a way that is much more digestible for their customers and employees. This could be by eliminating tools or applications that are producing cognitive overload, reducing the amount of members on a team, or even organizing your departments based on our knowledge of working memory.
This is especially true in new science of the concept of flow, made famous by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is a word Mihaly coined to describe a state of concentration or ‚Äòabsorption‚Äô with a specific task that humans ultimately find rewarding, pleasurable, and fulfilling. He describes it as an optimal state where we perform at our best and truly live ‚Äòin the moment‚Äô. One sure way to kill flow is by increasing distractions in the workplace. So, do you think that by giving your employees more tools, that it actually enhances performance? Miller‚Äôs Law teaches us time and time again this is not the case. When it comes to completing tasks, less is more.

John Cutler|18.2K|4|https://hackernoon.com/why-isnt-agile-working-d7127af1c552?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|Why Isn‚Äôt Agile Working? ‚Äì Hacker Noon|"I was visiting a relative a couple years ago. My poor cousin (the CEO of an insurance company) had been sold the Agile Silver Bullet TM and was pissed. He said something like:
I forget how I responded, but I know how I‚Äôd respond today. I‚Äôd draw some pictures and not even mention the word Agile. There are a couple core concepts I‚Äôd need to communicate to him....
First, if we look at lead time ‚Äî the time from when we dream up an idea, until it reaches customers ‚Äî you‚Äôll notice that most of the time is spent ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù. 15% flow efficiency (work time / lead time) is normal. Crazy, right? Yet we focus on what‚Äôs (relatively) visible...the small amount of time spent actually doing the job. The best companies hit 40%. Short story, to go faster, you need to address the waiting time.
It is not uncommon to have teams paying 75% ‚Äúinterest‚Äù on a combination of unplanned work and task switching. The team may not even be paying down the principle. It‚Äôs literally overhead, and often never tracked in the ticketing system. Most likely, the team complains about this (it is a terribly uninspiring situation). But ignored long enough, they accept the dismal reality.
Now imagine if this is a ‚Äúshared service‚Äù, and the team is responsible for addressing production issues, or provisioning new infrastructure while simultaneously doing ‚Äúprojects‚Äù. Suddenly you have a bottleneck.
Lesson: Address sources of unplanned work, and quantify the economic impact of having a shared service. Shared services make intuitive sense, but they often inspire a good deal of expensive pre-planning.
This is a fun trick. Plot the time-to-completion for your large, medium, and small work items. Try to move up a level and focus on items of actual customer value (not tasks). What you‚Äôll notice in many organizations is that the ‚Äúsize‚Äù of the work has no bearing on the time-to-completion. Why? There are too many other factors influencing how long it takes to complete the work (e.g. dependencies, unplanned work, lots of work in progress, etc.)
So much effort is spent reducing what I call ‚Äúdelivery risk‚Äù. This makes sense if you deliver custom projects and the customer pays cash-on-delivery. In SaaS (software as a service), we don‚Äôt get paid when we deliver the work. The benefits accrue over time. I call this ‚Äúbenefits risk‚Äù (the risk the work will be a dud).
It is common for big orgs to adopt Agile, but see no financial benefits. Why? Development is faster, but that has no bearing on 1) making the right product decisions, and 2) working to realize benefits. The whole POINT of Agile is to reduce risk. In project work, that risk is ‚Äúon time / within scope‚Äù. In product work, that risk is ‚Äúthis thing doesn‚Äôt ****ing work‚Äù. This is the whole fallacy of the PO ‚Äúaccepting‚Äù delivery of a feature. No benefit have been delivered!
Lots of companies adopt the model on the left. Few adopt the model on the right. When they get shitty results, they try to cram more work into the system which brings about a world of hurt.
And finally. Take a well understood reference feature and pass it through your product development system. Without managing complexity / refactoring / automation, it will take longer to complete this feature each year. Even if your team remains the exact same. Having something go from 3 days to 6 weeks is not unheard of.
Which brings me to Agile. Agile is worthless unless it serves as a catalyst for continuous improvement. Scrum and SAFe are worthless unless they serve as a catalyst for continuous improvement. Why? Because the factors that are slowing you down, are only partially due to whether you are sprinting, writing user stories, and doing biweekly demos. I‚Äôd argue those things are relatively minor (once you wrap your head around the idea of incrementally lowering risk).
To ‚Äúbe Agile‚Äù, you‚Äôll need to spend a good deal of money and energy on:
There‚Äôs no silver bullet. You have to do the work. Beware of anyone who says otherwise.

Now on to the original article.
by Michael Horton | VP Product and UX/UI Designer at PhoneWagon
We have been living in a world of ‚Äòclean and minimal‚Äô for quite some time, so what‚Äôs next?
Over the last several months, some of the leaders of innovative design have taken ‚Äòminimal design‚Äô to the next level. Facebook, Airbnb and Apple have followed a similar blueprint to simplify prominent products in a way that reflects this new trend of ‚ÄòComplexion Reduction‚Äô in mobile design.
You‚Äôve never heard of ‚ÄòComplexion Reduction‚Äô you say? Well yea, that‚Äôs because I just made the term up. Recently I‚Äôve noticed a new trend that is beyond flat design, beyond minimal design and independent of progressive reduction. Some may claim that this is just the next step of minimal design being implemented into the mobile realm but I say it is something more distinct. There are specific similarities and characteristics that define this new trend. So I decided to name it. I‚Äôm allowed to do that, right?
The defining characteristics of this hot new trend sweeping across Silicon Valley are:
The result? The user interfaces of some of our favorite apps are starting to look more and more like they could all be housed under the same brand.
I first started taking notice of this trend back in early May when Instagram released their redesigned UI.
Some of the changes they introduced included removing much of the blue and dark grey color used throughout the app, making headlines bolder and simplifying the bottom navigation and icons. What was left was a black and white UI with bold headlines where the content shined and functionality was clear. I appreciated the less cluttered interface and was reminded a bit of a platform I have been an admirer of for quite some time; Medium. Medium has been rocking the black and white since launch in 2012, and has reduced clutter with each redesign since; effectively making Medium one of the originators of CR (Complexion Reduction) without even knowing it. Congratulations, Medium!
Shortly after the folks over at FB unveiled Instagram‚Äôs look, I opened up the Airbnb app and was struck by how familiar it looked. This was my first time browsing the app since they released a redesign in April, yet I felt like I had seen this all before.
Airbnb‚Äôs redesigned UI didn‚Äôt get nearly the media coverage of Instagram‚Äôs redesign a month later (partly because it wasn‚Äôt accompanied by a shiny new app icon) but it followed many of the same CR tactics.
The mobile redesign introduced larger, bolder headlines, removed unnecessary imagery and color and simplified their icons to make them more universally recognizable. What was left was a very black and white UI where the content shined and functionality was clear.
Apple is the latest example of designers becoming enamored by the Complexion Reduction movement. Earlier this month, at Apple‚Äôs WWDC the tech giant announced a number of exciting things for consumers to look forward to, including the release of iOS 10, which they are dubbing, ‚ÄúThe biggest iOS release ever!‚Äù (or at least since iOS 8 which was referred to as... ‚ÄúThe biggest iOS release ever!‚Äù)
One announcement in particular caught my eye. That was the redesign of Apple Music. While the most important aspects of the redesign are UX updates and additional features, the aesthetic was the first thing I noticed. Caitlin McGarry, a staff writer at Macworld, described the updated appearance well, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a totally new look, with giant cards, bigger and bolder fonts, and a clean white background that allows the album art to shine.‚Äù
Sound familiar? The design differs slightly from the blueprint used by Instagram and Airbnb (they use solid icons! What the heck Apple?) but the key elements are there: large bold headlines, black and white UI.
As I mentioned earlier, this means more and more of your favorite apps are going to start looking like one another. Why? Much like the NFL, tech is a copycat league. These redesigns were met with generally positive reviews (some people are complaining about a ‚Äòlack of personality‚Äô in these new black and white UIs but they‚Äôll soon get over that. You open an app for it‚Äôs functionality, not it‚Äôs personality) so I expect apps both new and old to start jumping on the CR bandwagon.
Now, whether you are for or against this monochromatic fad, it is undoubtedly a sign of progress. The product design process is advancing and evolving from the old segmented approach that encouraged superfluous design to a more holistic process that truly is focused on the user. In the old product design process a UI designer may be handed wireframes by a UX or product person with the instructions ‚Äòmake it pretty‚Äô. That designer would then spend hours or days adding color, removing color, changing color when the best solution may have been right there in front of them all along... the wireframes! As the lines between UX and UI designer blur in today‚Äôs more integrated design process, designers become less worried about their specific responsibilities (like making it pretty) and focus on the ultimate goal of creating the best product for their user.
So you‚Äôre sold on CR and ready to hop on the bandwagon? Good, follow these guidelines and you‚Äôll have an award winning app in no time.
Thanks for reading! Hit the heart if you enjoyed.

The internet suffers from a lack of imagination, so I asked my students to redesign it

Today‚Äôs internet is bland. Everything looks the same: generic fonts, no layouts to speak of, interchangeable pages, and an absence of expressive visual language. Even micro-typography is a mess.
Web design today seems to be driven by technical and ideological constraints rather than creativity and ideas. Every page consists of containers in containers in containers; sometimes text, sometimes images. Nothing is truly designed, it‚Äôs simply assumed.
Ironically, today‚Äôs web technologies have enormous design capabilities. We have the capability to implement almost every conceivable idea and layout. We can create radical, surprising, and evocative websites. We can combine experimental typography with generative images and interactive experiences.
And yet, even websites for designers are based on containers in containers in containers. The most popular portals for creatives on the web ‚Äî Dribbble and Behance ‚Äî are so fundamentally boring they‚Äôre basically interchangeable. (See lead image.)
How did this happen?
There are a few reasons. Technological frameworks like Content Management Systems (CMS) and blogging platforms like WordPress are based on templates. Web pages on these frameworks are not individually crafted but generated on the fly by piecing together various media types like images, headlines, body text, and videos. Templates are not designs. Rather, they are rules for combining related data types. Beyond the template, these platforms typically offer users no way to influence a page‚Äôs visual appearance. What you see is what you poured into the template.
In other words, templates are content agnostic. And that is the problem.
One of the fundamental principles of design is a deep and meaningful connection between form and content; form should both reflect and shape content. Separating them breaks this principle and creates generic content containers. In a design sense, templates are meaningless; the form adds nothing to the content.
There are plenty of other reasons for web design‚Äôs lack of creativity. Most of them are economic and pragmatic. For example, it‚Äôs time-consuming to design individual pages. Considering the speed of online news and the frequency of new articles, large websites simply do not have the resources to design a page from the ground up. Furthermore, web design is still a matter of technical expertise: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS remain challenging tools for designers. There‚Äôs no web design equivalent to the direct and obliging workflows of desktop publishing applications.
I suspect designers‚Äô creative and intellectual laziness is to blame, too. In the age of mobile-first, generic, framework-driven development, nobody seems to bother with the visual and contextual integrity of a web page.
How can we tackle this challenge? What can expressive and avant-garde websites look like today?
Sometimes, if you want to design the future, you have to rediscover the past.
I designed my first website about 23 years ago at the research and development group at the University of the Arts in Bremen, Germany. Creating web pages was hot at the time. The web was young. Pages sparked my imagination.
In the mid-nineties, we were struggling with the constraints of HTML. We could only use web-safe fonts like Arial, Times, or Verdana. We had to use table layouts, monospaced fonts, or GIFs if we wanted to do anything exciting. HTML was purely content-driven initially, and we had to work against the technology in order to design a page.
At the same time, experimental typography was exploding. From Jan Tschichold‚Äôs Die Neue Typographie in the twenties to the computer-driven layouts by April Greiman in the eighties, designers challenged the status quo and tried to find a visual language that represented the ideas and revolutions of their eras. By the mid-nineties, an unusual combination of technological and cultural advancements allowed for a very radical breed of graphic design. You could see it in the work of Irma Boom, David Carson, Paula Scher, Neville Brody, and many others.
Compared to the visual explosion of the graphic design world, however, early web pages were still fairly lame. (The Web Design Museum documents this very well.)
We wanted to do graphic design in the browser, but nobody knew how ‚Äî or what mistakes could be made. There were no expectations of how a web page should look. There were no standards. No CMS (almost), no CSS, no JS, no video, no animation.
Fast forward to 2018, and we can do everything in a browser. From massive-scale layouts to micro-typography, animation, and video. And what do we do with these incredible possibilities? Containers in containers in containers. Gigabytes of visually bland mobile-first pages contaminated with JavaScript. Generic templates that follow the same visual rules. If my younger self could have seen the state of web design 23 years later, he would have been very disappointed.
Web design‚Äôs problem is not the limits of technology but the limits of our imagination. We‚Äôve become far too obedient to visual conformity, economic viability, and assumed expectations.
However, every crisis creates an opportunity. Now is as good a time as any to challenge the internet‚Äôs visual conformity. Alas, I am too old and too bourgeois to come up with a radical, experimental, and state-of-the-art approach to web design. But I can ask my students to do it.
In 2017, I gave a web design class at the Interface Design Programme in Potsdam, Germany. Each team was asked to come up with a redesign for an existing website. The assignment was very clear: Treat the browser as a blank canvas and create expressive, imaginative visual experiences. Use the technological potential of current web technologies as a channel for your creativity. Do not be constrained by questions of usability, legibility, and flexibility. Have an attitude. Disregard ErwartungskonformitaÃàt.
I was very happy with the outcome of the class. (You can see all the results on this overview page.) Here are four projects that represent different approaches to the challenge.
Frederic and Jonas chose the web site of the Zentrum fuÃàr Kunst und Medien (ZKM) as a starting point for their experiments and explorations. A very fitting choice as the ZKM is one of the most prominent exhibition spaces for media art in Germany but ZKM‚Äôs website is fairly conventional. It‚Äôs functional but it lacks the avant-garde assertion that is conveyed by artwork in the exhibitions.
Frederic and Jonas‚Äôs aim was to design a concept, a visual language, and a technical setup for the ZKM site that represents the museum‚Äôs progressive approach. At the core of their concept is a generative design engine: Every time a page loads, a new layout is created.
View the redesign of the ZKM.
Streem is an art and street magazine. It is both a stage for upcoming artists and a platform for social issues. Streem includes work from illustration, painting, photography, design, writing, and journalism. Daria, Bela, and Lucas combined these different influences and based their designs on a conceptual city structure. For their prototype, they created four different neighborhoods that each represent a section of the magazine. Their approach combines strong illustrative styles with spatial typography in order to create a legible city.
View the redesign of Streem.
Amelie and Fabian took a very structural approach. Instead of finding an adequate form for a specific story, their aim was to dissolve a web page and break it down to semantic, syntactical, and statistical properties. Their idea was to demonstrate the fluidity and inherent malleability of HTML. They deconstructed Medium posts and created an environment that allows readers to break long blocks of text into experimental typographic space.
View the redesign of Medium.
Fabian and Florian turned Hacker News into an interactive visualization. The social media site is a news aggregator, focusing on computer science and information technology. Its design is bare-bones but it has complex functionality for voting and discussions. Fabian and Florian have taken the existing structure and turned it into a typographic space of timelines and networks. The visual presentation is based on the sequence and connections of news and comments. They also connected their design to the API of Hacker News, so you can actually use it to read the site. View the redesign of Hacker News.
David Carson once said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt confuse communication with legibility.‚Äù We should apply this advice to the current state of web design. Legibility, usability, responsiveness, and especially accessibility are essential qualities of the modern web. But they should not define and limit its visual repertoire. If you equate stereotypes with usability, you have understood neither visual design nor human-centered design.
I, for one, would like to see more radical, generative, evocative, thoughtful, adequate, content-specific, and intelligent web design. I would like to rediscover the web as a space for design experiments. I would like to be surprised more often. I don‚Äôt know what the web will look in another 23 years, but I certainly hope it doesn‚Äôt look like the web today.

One of the best analogy I have come across that explains the importance of this is from Kevin Hale (Founder of Wufoo), who spoke at ZURBsoapbox. He claims that the very first customer experience is like being on a first date
I am sure most of you can see the truth in that statement. So now that we know, creating an amazing first experience for the user is paramount, let us think about how to go about doing it. Your website design as a whole will leave a lasting impression on your visitor. You can use some small UI changes to your existing site, to make a lasting impression.
When you think about it some of the most common ways the visitor interacts with you on your website will be via the contact form to get in touch with you, the login box to register an account on your site, or when they sign up for your newsletter to know when you will launch you awesome product, etc.
So it‚Äôs very likely they will end up using a form or some sort of input field like a text box. So today we are going to look at some really cool form and input field designs that will help you WOW your customers.
Instead of showing 6 fields that the user has to interact with, this minimal form interface only shows one text input at a time, without any clutter or distractions. There are subtle visual cues like the tiny progress bar and a number that indicates the number of input fields to be completed. One drawback is that, there is no way to go back to a previous entry. Check out the tutorial on codrops to see how to create this minimal form interface.
How cool would it be to use a sentence where some words act as dropdown selector and text inputs fields to grab info from your users? This awesome natural language form tutorial will give you all the information you need to set one up on your website.
This experimental fullscreen form gives visitors a distraction-free form filling experience.
Here are some pretty sweet email subscription form animations that will put a smile on your customer‚Äôs face.
These guys encourage their visitors to request an early access by providing an Instagram account during signup.
This credit card form uses a visual representation of the card to obtain the users input from the 16 digit code, expiry date and CVV code.
this is a simple form that will allow your visitor to add the credit card number and other important card related data all from the single field.
You can find more helpful code snippet on CodeMyUI.com
I hope you guys like these examples. If you have come across other cool ways in which we can design or animate form please do let me know about it, so that I can update this list.

Eugen EsÃßanu|40K|9|https://uxplanet.org/10-small-design-mistakes-we-still-make-1cd5f60bc708?source=tag_archive---------9---------------------|10 Small Design Mistakes We Still Make ‚Äì UX Planet|"The saying that ‚Äúgood design is obvious‚Äù is pretty damn old, and I am sure it took different shapes in the previous centuries. It referred to good food, music, architecture, clothes, philosophy and everything else.
We forget that human mind changes very slow, and the knowledge you have about human behaviour will not go old for at least 50 years or so. To make it easy for you, we need to keep consistent with a couple of principles that will remind us of how to design great products. We should be told at least once a month about these small principles until we live and breathe good design.
Steve Krug laid out some useful principles back in 2000, after the dot-com boom which are still valuable and relevant nowadays. Even after his revised version, nothing changed. Yes, you will tell me that the looks are more modern and the websites are more organised and advanced (no more flash!). But what I mean about that is ‚Äî nothing has changed in human behaviour. We will always want the principle ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make me think‚Äù applied to any type of product we interact (whether it is a microwave, tv, smartphone or car).
The reason for that is ‚Äî we are on a mission, and we only look for the thing that interests us. For example, I rarely remember myself going through all the text on the homepage of a product website. Why? Because most of the web users are trying to get something done, and done quickly. We do not have time to read more than necessary. And we still put a lot of text because we think people need to know that. Or as some designers say: ‚Äúit adds to the experience‚Äù.
Another important aspect that will help scanning a page is offering a proper visual hierarchy. We have to make it clear that the appearance on a page portrays the relationship between elements. So there are a couple of principles for that:
We believe that people want something new and more. But we forget that there are so many applications on the market that each demands our time. Each of them has different interactions, and we need to learn each one of them. And our mind blows up when: ‚ÄúOh man, another app to learn?!‚Äù.
We as designers, when asked to design something new, have a temptation to try and reinvent the wheel. Because doing something like everyone else seems somehow wrong. We have been hired to do something different. Not to mention that the industry rarely offers awards and praises for designing something that has ‚Äúthe best use of conventions‚Äù.
Our job is to make stuff clear and obvious. If obvious is not an option, then at least self-explanatory. The main thing you need to know about instructions is that nobody is going to read them. We should aim for removing the instructions to make everything self-explanatory. But when they are necessary, cut as much as possible. (but, really, nobody is going to read them). We muddle through.
Take IKEA as an example. If you gave an average person to assemble a wardrobe from IKEA, I am sure that he will assemble it right most of the times. Why? It is, most of the cases, apparent on how it should be assembled if we have a clear picture in front of us. But even in instances where they look at the instructions, there are no words ‚Äî only images.
For most of the people, it is not essential to know or understand how your product works. Not because they are not intelligent, but merely because they do not care. So once they nail down the use of your product, they will rarely switch to something else.
Let‚Äôs take as an example the Apple AirPods. We can all admit that they are the worst sounding earbuds for the price you pay. But when I look at how people interact with it, I understand the real reason why they buy it. They do not make you think about why it is not working. You even don‚Äôt notice they have new technology.
I look at how my mom interacts with them, and she never asked me what technology is behind or how they work. She knows that whenever you open the case near your device, it is going to connect. It is that easy.
My favourite one. We, designers, love giving the users subtle effects and add beautiful delights. Right? Well, what if I told you that your users don‚Äôt care about it? No matter how much they tell you they do, they don‚Äôt. First time? Yes. Second? Ok. Third? Really, how much do I have to see this until it‚Äôs enough?
Why is this happening? Life is a much more stressful and demanding environment than an app‚Äôs delights and subtle effects. For example, you are a father, and your kid is screaming because he wants ice cream, the dog is barking because somebody is calling at the front door and you are trying to book a quick train ticket that should leave in 40 minutes. In that specific moment, people will not give a f* about your subtle cues. On the other side, we should use them, but not when it kills the user flow.
Focus group is a small group of people that sit around at the table and discuss things. They talk about their opinions about the product, past experiences, their feelings and reactions to new concepts. Focus groups are great for determining what your audience wants.
A usability test is about watching one person at a time trying to use something (your product in this case). In this case, you ask them to perform specific actions to see if you need to fix something in your concepts. So focus groups is about listening and usability tests are about watching.
All of us who design digital products have the moment when they say ‚Äî ‚ÄúI am a user too, so I know what is good or bad.‚Äù And because of that, we tend to have strong feelings about what we like and don‚Äôt.
We enjoy using products with ______, or we think that _____ is a big pain. And when we work on a team it tends to be hard to check those feelings at the door. The result is a room full of people with strong personal feelings on what it takes to design a great product. We tend to think that most of the users are like us.
It is not productive and will not add any value if you ask questions such as: ‚ÄúDo people like drop-down menus?‚Äù. The right question to ask is: ‚ÄúDoes this drop-down menu, with these words, in this context, on this page create a good experience for people who are likely to use the site?‚Äù
The reason for that is if we focus on what people like, we will lose focus and energy. Usability testing will erase any ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and show you what needs to be done.
The point is that every question that pops into our head, when using your product, only adds up to the cognitive workload. It distracts our attention from ‚Äúwhy I am here‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat I need to do‚Äù. And as a rule, people don‚Äôt enjoy solving puzzles when they merely want to know if that button is clickable or not.
And every time you make a user tap on something that does not work, or it looks like a button/link but it‚Äôs not, it also adds up to the pile of questions. And this happens because who built the product did not care too much about the product.
Make sure to share down in the comments small design mistakes we do on a daily basis for our products (whether apps or websites) so others can learn from them too. The article was written based on the revised version of the book Don‚Äôt Make Me Think by Steve Krug.

Brandon Chu|2.2K|8|https://blackboxofpm.com/the-black-box-of-product-management-3feb65db6ddb?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|The Black Box of Product Management ‚Äì The Black Box of Product Management|"There is a rite of passage in the product management world, where all PMs have experienced being asked:
‚ÄúWhat does a product manager do, anyway?‚Äù
I empathize with designers and engineers for asking this question. In their shoes, I would be just as skeptical, because a product manager‚Äôs activities are fragmented, and don‚Äôt reveal the true discipline beneath.
When I first started in product management, I didn‚Äôt even know I was doing it. Instead, I was a first time founder and thought I was just ‚Äúdoing startup‚Äù.
Later, when I interviewed for a PM job, some much more qualified people told me that I was, in fact, doing product management. I got the job. Early into that role, I was asked the infamous question above. I wasn‚Äôt offended; in fact, I was just as curious as them, so I started reading (and reading) about product management. The internet said many things:
I soaked it all in. I re-read Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager ‚Äî my bible of product management ‚Äî weekly, for the first few months.
And then I shipped, and shipped some more. And pretty soon I felt useful.
Years into that job, I started managing other product teams. Other PMs were now looking to me to define expectations, so that they could now respond to questions of why they existed. I offered a cocktail of the best posts I‚Äôd read, and examples of the experiences I‚Äôd had over the years.
I‚Äôm currently at Shopify in my third role in product, and again I find myself rethinking assumptions about what it is I truly do. Shopify is a true engineering culture, and has very few product managers relative to the size of the company. For perspective, my last company had 1:10 ratio of PMs to employees. Shopify (including directors) is closer to 1:80.
One of the best things about working here has been observing an alternative approach to how products can be built and shipped effectively. Shopify engineers and designers are incredibly talented, opinionated and independent, and learning to effectively work with them has forced me to change the way I perceive my craft.
It‚Äôs also forced me to figure out what shouldn‚Äôt change, and in doing so, push me to abstract away the what in favour of the why. This post isn‚Äôt about Shopify, nor is it about the how to be an effective product manager. It‚Äôs about why product management exists.
Product Management is the by-product of two exponential forces being exerted on a company.
Speed is an exponential force because with every period of time, more change is occurring than in the last. Similarly with scale; every extra feature, employee, or user is adding more complexity to the system than the last.
The reason product management as a career has been popularized in predominantly software companies, is because software is inherently fast and scalable.
The internet changed how software products were delivered to the market. Long gone are the days of annual releases and cardboard boxes on shelves. For the last two decades, teams have been writing code, deploying it, and giving updates to all their customers instantaneously.
Software development itself has a lowered bar of entry. Approachability of high level programming languages, and the prevalence of open source libraries has super charged developers with unprecedented productivity. At the same time, the infrastructure costs of building a functional product and deploying it has dropped to basically zero.
In this way, speed has two meanings: both how quickly you can get something to market with software development, and (critically) how competition forces companies to go faster to survive.
The reason why sub 50-person startups rarely have product managers is that the complexity is still manageable. The CEO and co-founders are still able to coordinate the company towards a focused problem and unleash the power of a scrappy startup upon it.
But as the company grows, complexity emerges as more features are added, customers become more diverse, and the team grows. And that complexity grows exponentially.
For example, how many meetings do you think a 20-person startup can have?
The answer shows why we suck at conceptualizing the exponential.
The problem the company solves grows in complexity as well. As teams solve high level problems, they spawn hundreds of derivative problems, all begging to be solved. The catch is the company can‚Äôt solve them all. Faced with hundreds of problems to solve, choosing where to focus quickly becomes the most important decision a company makes.
When you consider the simultaneous impacts of speed and scale on a company, it‚Äôs easy to conceptualize how things will eventually derail without someone thinking holistically about the company. Ultimately, that role is for the CEO, but when they‚Äôve reached their multi-tasking limits, who else can fill the void?
Sure, products need some oversight - got it. Why not just train everyone to be able to manage the product, why hire a specific role?
The short answer is that it‚Äôs harder than you think to manage a product, and it takes years of experience to become capable. Here‚Äôs the long answer:
The core competency of a product manager is truly understanding product development. That is, how to identify which problem to solve and how to work with a team to solve it.
Anyone who‚Äôs been through a few launches knows that despite the textbooks, a linear product development process like the one below is a fairy tale.
Even if you included feedback loops between the steps, the idea of neat and tidy sequential steps, where functional teams work together through a checklist is flawed. It simply does not fit into a world where technology is progressing exponentially.
I view modern product development as a system of interconnected disciplines, working in a network, to deliver on a user‚Äôs desire. Product managers are the API that facilitates communication in this network.
Each node represents a broad bucket of domain expertise, each with enough depth that people dedicate careers to master them. This is an important quality of product development in a company where speed and scale have reached critical mass: there‚Äôs too much to know, so only a team can effectively deliver a product.
The process of product development is how this system moves through time.
Product managers shepherd this system from problem identification through to product launch, ensuring that each node in the network is aware of the progression of the others, and that users increasingly want what is being developed.
Finally, organizational scale brings with it multiple teams. And an effective product development system coordinates and focuses those teams towards the company‚Äôs vision.
As the product development APIs, product managers support company wide efficiency by ensuring no duplication of effort, and sharing infrastructure to enable other teams to go faster.
Product managers spend years to develop the skills required to be responsible for this system. It‚Äôs a multidisciplinary, breadth over depth approach to learning.
In my career, I‚Äôve done all of: programming, UI design, UX research, financial modelling, business development, support, copy-writing, accounting, legal, contract negotiation, reporting, marketing, blog posts, FAQs, and product copy.
I‚Äôve been an expert in none, and achieved borderline competence in some. I knew just enough of each to be useful as an API, but never enough to be dangerous (in a good way). That‚Äôs the quintessential quality of a product manager‚Äôs skill set, one that makes it hard for builder types to grok exactly what value they bring.
A product manager‚Äôs multidisciplinary awareness enables them to communicate in whatever language is necessary to effectively deliver information across the team.
They‚Äôre also in the best position to assess the impact of change across the system. A recent conversation I had with Shopify‚Äôs CEO, expressed this pretty succinctly to me.
Exactly right.
In a world where speed is king and the world is changing exponentially, having time to develop consensus before action is often a luxury. Teams need critical decisions made on a daily basis in order to maintain speed, and those decisions have major trade offs and/or conflicting interests among stakeholders.
Driving those decisions is no one else‚Äôs job but the product manager‚Äôs.
Whereas the work of engineers and designers are easier quantified, because it‚Äôs difficult to observe a PMs impact over the short run, the ambiguity around Product Management will remain for some time.
One day, there may be graduate degrees and definite career paths to product management, but not today. Until then, companies will continue to scale, the world will continue to get faster, and sooner or later ‚Äúwe need someone to manage this‚Äù will get proposed.
If you‚Äôre a PM, don‚Äôt get butt-hurt the next time someone challenges your existence. Embrace ambiguity (you‚Äôre a PM, after all) and have confidence in your purpose.
Oh, and Shopify is hiring.

Thierry Meier|1.7K|6|https://medium.com/@thierrymeier/filtering-and-sorting-best-practices-on-mobile-61626449cec?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|Filtering and Sorting Best Practices on Mobile ‚Äì Thierry Meier ‚Äì Medium|"Whenever a designer faces the challenge of displaying vast amounts of data to users, filtering and sorting options become inevitable. Filtering and sorting help users narrow down the data that can be displayed according to what they are looking for.
Currently I am working on a mobile experience for a large electronics retailer. A good navigational structure, thought-out filtering and sorting will be key to providing users a painless way to find what they are looking for.
Designing a filtering and sorting solution is by no means rocket science, however, there are a couple of different approaches one could take.
A lot of applications are using this approach. Filters are offered to the user on the screen of the search results. The filter view is laid over the results in order to give context to the items that are being displayed.
When to use: Works well if filtering options are not too vast and you want to maintain context to the results displayed. Always works well when displaying search results.
Case study: Foursquare and Etsy are using the same approaches, making use of a standard pattern, while Amazon went for a custom solution. Note that Amazon has sub-filters or a second level of filters.
This method is similar to the one mentioned above. However, it sacrifices context for the sake of a more focused experience and more real estate to work with.
When to use: If there is a lot of data that needs to be filtered, then going for a slide over makes sense. It gives you more room to work with and the user is not being distracted while going through the many options.
Case study: In the screenshots above, Hostelworld could benefit from an on screen context filtering method. Only two options are being asked of the user to filter. I would use an approach similar to Foursquare‚Äôs above. Hostelworld could also benefit from a ‚ÄúReset‚Äù action to easily clear filters.
Search results are tricky since the data returned varies heavily based on the input of the user. What approach will be a good solution depends on the amount of verticals and total amount of data.
Case Study: Apple treats every search request equally. Categories which were previously selected through a view are now put inside a fullscreen filter view. Etsy on the other hand has a very flexible solution. Etsy is providing users a different approach based on how specific their search request is.
If users search for a general term such as ‚Äúanchor‚Äù, Etsy offers you to narrow down your search results by categories. When searching for a more specific term such as ‚Äúanchor necklace‚Äù, Etsy will return a list of items right away.
Unlike filtering, sorting does not limit what is being shown to the user but it changes the way results are being displayed. Popular sorting functionalities are price, quality or alphabetic order. In order to save space, one can merge the filter and sort views as seen above by Etsy and Foursquare.
When to use: Sorting makes sense when it is hard for users to point out extremes (e.g. the lowest price) by themselves. On mobile, this is the case quite early since designers work with a very limited viewport. It is a subjective decision designers have to make.
Case study: While TripAdvisor and Kayak use the slide-over approach, Hostelworld once again uses the full-screen approach. Again, I would advise them against using this approach as it takes users away from the results.
Not everything should be filtered. It is smart to address top level decisions such as product categories on separate screens. Those are decisions that are being made by almost all users, no matter what they are looking for.
A user will know in what category he will likely find his item, however, he might not be sure yet in what price range or what colour.
When to use: Not everything should be stuffed in filters. Important top level choices which are being made by almost all users are best being made upfront. It also declutters and simplifies the user experience.
Case study: Tapmates lets you specify the product category when you enter a store on their app. They could have showed users items right after entering the store and bury the product categories in a filter.
Filtering and sorting are powerful tools to make it easier for users to find what they are looking for. Spend some extra time thinking about your possibilities ‚Äî it will pay off down the line.
Always keep in mind that there is always the possibility that the best approach is to have no filtering or sorting features at all. Postmates is a great example for this.
It is also valuable to find out which filters are being used the most. Based on those findings you arrange the filters accordingly. Airbnb knows that most people use the listing type and price filter, so they put them on top.
That‚Äôs about it. As mentioned ‚Äî no rocket science.
If you have more patterns around the topic of filtering and sorting, please reach out to me and I‚Äôll try to include it in this post.

Jared M. Spool|1.6K|6|https://medium.com/uie-brain-sparks/themes-a-small-change-to-product-roadmaps-with-large-effects-a9a9a496b800?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|Themes: A Small Change to Product Roadmaps with Large Effects|"I‚Äôm in love. I‚Äôm in love with an idea. A quite simple idea, really. But one that has amazing effects when put into motion.
It‚Äôs Bruce McCarthy‚Äôs idea. Bruce is a product manager‚Äôs product manager and one of the smartest people I know. He told this idea to me. And now I‚Äôm telling it to you.
Bruce and I were talking about product roadmaps, which describe features the team commits to ship over the next few releases. For most organizations, everything revolves around the roadmap.
Marketing uses the roadmap to plan the stories they‚Äôll tell to entice new customers (and get existing ones to upgrade). Customer support uses it to ensure reps are trained to help with new features. And, of course, product development uses it to allocate resources and to speed future development.
It was while we were discussing roadmaps that Bruce shattered my world with a single word: Themes. Themes are an alternative for features. Instead of promising to build a specific feature, the team commits to solving a specific customer problem.
A typical roadmap feature might be a data export capability to Salesforce. Customers may have even asked for this feature, saying they‚Äôd buy a ton more licenses if the product made it easy to move the data.
But with Bruce‚Äôs Themes, the product strategy team would research why customers want to move their data to Salesforce. How does it make their life easier? Might it be even better if the data could move in both directions? How up to date does the Salesforce data need to be? What happens after it gets into Salesforce? What‚Äôs the bigger problem that needs solving?
That last question is quite interesting. By understanding how having the data exported to Salesforce contributes to solving a bigger problem, the team may uncover interesting alternative solutions. Maybe Salesforce is just an intermediate stop along the way to becoming something bigger? If so, maybe there‚Äôs functionality the team could add to the product (or even better, might already exist but is currently hard to find)?
Bruce says Themes help teams stay focused without prematurely committing to a solution that may not be the best idea later on. This is particularly important for roadmaps that go out 2, 3, or more years into a fuzzy future. The viability of a feature may shift dramatically, while the nature of an important customer problem will likely remain the same. As each part of the roadmap gets closer, the customer problems often become clearer, making solutions easier to find.
We‚Äôve found this to dovetail nicely with another phenomenon we‚Äôve observed: When a team has a clear definition of a problem, solutions are often easy. Usually, the biggest source of trouble with defining solutions comes from unclear problem definitions. By making the problem the centerpiece of the strategy, more resources will be available to help with definition.
The sheer brilliance of Bruce‚Äôs idea is how, with a single gesture, learning everything about the customers becomes the most important focus of creating the product strategy. When companies talk about features, they are saying, ‚ÄúLook at us. Look at what we can do.‚Äù When companies talk about the problems of the customers, they are saying, ‚ÄúLook at what you‚Äôre dealing with. Look at how we want to help.‚Äù
Whereas the company used to want to have dozens (or in some cases, hundreds) of features in each release, customer problems can be smaller in number. If it‚Äôs a big problem that lots of customers are dealing with, it can be the only thing included in the release.
Now, after the team starts to solve the problem, it might mean they make a bunch of changes throughout the product. But each of those changes goes straight to explaining its role in solving that specific customer problem.
This becomes an important razor for deciding what takes priority. Pick 2 or 3 important customer problems for this release. Any change to the product that doesn‚Äôt help solve one of those problems is eliminated from the backlog.
So many features in today‚Äôs products are solutions without a clear problem to solve. This razor keeps teams focused, which means time to delivery will often be faster.
You can‚Äôt fill a roadmap with customer problems if you don‚Äôt know anything about your customers. By moving away from the invention of features (which can be done independent of whether customers need what you‚Äôre building), the roadmap technique requires deep and thorough customer insights.
The best way to acquire these insights is through solid, constant user research. Product managers now need to initiate customer visits and observations, looking for what those customers truly need and what obstacles they face.
User research changes its status, from a luxury of the product design process to a preliminary requirement of the strategy process. Tracking and synthesizing different problems now becomes a standard way to talk about how the product is built. Customers are at the center of every discussion of what‚Äôs in and what‚Äôs out.
Another major benefit of the shift to solving customer problems is the shift away from playing competitive catch-up. As the product team studies what their customers need, they won‚Äôt start by looking at what the competition has. Any competition still working with a feature focus will miss opportunities.
Almost always, important customer problems aren‚Äôt being solved by any companies in the competitive landscape. This is because everybody is constantly trying to out-do each other, not paying attention to customers at all.
The first company to move to defining their roadmap as solvable customer problems gets a jump on the competition. They provide innovative solutions just by solving pressing problems, getting an immediate jump on what the competitors incorrectly think is important.
Instead of doing a competitive analysis, the strategy team is now talking about what‚Äôs missing in the marketplace. They‚Äôre completely focused on what nobody else is doing. That‚Äôs a solid competitive advantage.
Marketing groups face a chore when it‚Äôs time to tell the world about the next major release of their product. They have to gather up all the features and synthesize a narrative that makes people want all those things. What is the big story about how these independently designed and developed features make the customer‚Äôs life better?
Bruce‚Äôs Themes replaces that chore by handing the narrative to the marketing group on a silver platter. Here are the problems we set out to solve and here‚Äôs how we solved them.
Every element of the new release tells the story marketing needs to tell. (And if the marketing group was smart, they were part of the strategy team in the first place, so they saw this coming their way all along.)
Part of solving a customer‚Äôs problem is making sure you don‚Äôt make it worse. By having the problem as the starting point for the project, the development team has an instant baseline to measure against.
Given a customer problem, the team will come up with multiple solutions. Picking the best solution becomes a trade off of effort against the improvement they can deliver. Determining these factors is easier when they start with a clearly defined problem. Without a commitment to specific solutions, the team has flexibility.
One consistent problem with the feature approach comes when the team tries to wedge more features into an already crowded and complex product. They run the chance of making the product even more difficult to use because the new features don‚Äôt dovetail nicely with what already exists.
With Bruce‚Äôs Themes approach, the team now has the power to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to any solution that makes the problem worse. That includes making the product more complex. The base requirement of making the customer‚Äôs life easier forces a more cohesive, simpler design to emerge.
Organizations who have grown up in a feature mindset will struggle with the shift to customer problems. The primal desire to ask, ‚ÄúBut what feature are we shipping?‚Äù will not go down without a fight. Vigilance among the product strategy team (and air cover from senior management) will be a basic requirement to make Themes work.
However, after the team gets the hang of thinking in terms of solving customers‚Äô problems, and reaps all the benefits that come from that, it‚Äôs likely to become the norm. The wins felt by every part of the organization as customers are put into the center of the strategy process will easily make them a driving force in the market.
Thanks to Bruce McCarthy for providing the fantastic idea of Themes.

Brian Nelson|1K|6|https://medium.com/brian-nelson-s-portfolio/google-calendar-concept-7291a9923711?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|Google Calendar Concept ‚Äì Brian Nelson‚Äôs Portfolio ‚Äì Medium|"Navigating dozens of apps to find your content is cumbersome and time consuming. As a consequence, platforms that bundle content from various sources have become extremely valuable and popular. A calendar platform can automatically pull relevant events from your apps, which means that you don‚Äôt have to spend time digging through those apps or manually creating events.
Compared with events you have manually added to your calendar, events pulled from apps can be far more comprehensive and informative ‚Äî full of engaging and actionable components. Consumers now expect rich interactive media, and relying on static plain text is a huge missed opportunity. In my concept, your calendar will provide immediate access to media such as TV episode recaps (HBO GO), sport highlights (ESPN), and Tweets from live events.
Google Now integrates over 100 third party services (and has plans to open access to all developers), while Google Calendar only connects with other Google services. Google should follow in the footsteps of Sunrise (acquired by Microsoft in February), and create an open platform for third party developers. Google‚Äôs recent acquisition of Timeful is an encouraging sign of their commitment to building a truly intelligent, assistive calendar.
In the future, triplicate event items from Songkick, Facebook, and Eventbrite are merged. The new event provides deep app links to the artist‚Äôs catalogue (in Apple Music, Spotify, or SoundCloud), getting you psyched for the show.
Tapping the location reveals options to view the address in Google Maps or call a car (on the day of the event). The QR code expands when tapped, making it easy to check in once you arrive at the venue. Your calendar should make you feel at ease, knowing that everything you need is instantly accessible.
Your calendar should encompass all the fun things you do, and make it easy to look back and relive your favorite experiences. In this example, a calendar event summarizes a weekend trip with friends using photos, videos, profile pictures, and a map.
The success of Facebook‚Äôs and Instagram‚Äôs core products attest to our basic desire to reminisce. Several tech companies have made more overt attempts to capitalize on this impulse‚Äîby reminding you of your activity a year ago today (TimeHop, Heyday, Facebook On This Day, Memoir) or summarizing an entire year of your life (Facebook Year in Review, Spotify Year in Music).
Given how well your calendar knows you, and how much it knows about the world, it should suggest highly relevant events and appointments that you‚Äôd be sorry to miss. In this example, your calendar recommends a visit to the dentist, using your past calendar events and the information you‚Äôve added to ZocDoc.
This flow demonstrates how your calendar will update automatically based on new messages you receive. In the future, you won‚Äôt have to adjust calendar events as details change. More importantly, you‚Äôll never show up to the wrong restaurant because you missed a text.
Google‚Äôs Now on Tap, announced at I/O 2015, understands context and intent deeply, and would enable dynamic event items as shown above.
The first step to changing your behavior is understanding it. The Monthly Summary shown above is a receipt for all of your app activity organized by categories that matter to you, like health, social life, professional development, and personal finances.
Note that the Summary doesn‚Äôt pass judgement on what you‚Äôve done; it‚Äôs just a list of stats. The next, trickier step is creating a report card that makes encouraging and effective suggestions about what tweaks you can make to be happier, healthier, more productive, and better to yourself and others.
Fitbit, Jawbone, Apple Health and a host of other health technology companies are all based upon this same premise, that easier access to and visualization of our data can change our behavior for the better. Companies like Reporter and RescueTime are similar, but seek to provide insights that improve our relationships with our loved ones and our work, respectively.
Calendar is a natural place for an aggregation of individual events. Summaries (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly), comparisons, trends, and correlations could all prove valuable.
Here is a collection of all of the use cases I explored.

We nail the product to its core and define different usage patterns and provide solutions to the various complexities involved. Often times we know that the one‚Äôs who use our products have different preferences, and so we go ahead and give users the ability to configure the product to their usage. This article will give you some guidelines in creating a good settings/preferences for your product.
Story of the photo from Flickr
The no. of choices and inputs are just too many in the above, the user had to tinker around to find the correct way to wash.
Difficult product decisions should never become a setting. For example: If there‚Äôs a debate in your team which is building an email client, whether to show four lines of summary or two lines of summary for each email. Do not make it a setting!
This flowchart from android design guidelines gives you an idea on how to cho0se what becomes a setting and what doesn‚Äôt.
People infrequently use settings. Below are a few tweets of users trying to find a particular setting.
All these tweets have a negative sentiment, and give a hint of emotions like perplexity, tiresome, frustration and disappointment. What would follow is disinterest in using the product.
Tweets of people when they found the setting.
Its a sense of achievement for someone who‚Äôs found the setting to configure the product to the usage pattern. Changing a configuration shouldn‚Äôt be a task for product owners.
If you‚Äôve handled a decent camera (point and shoot or DSLR) you would have faced this problem. My camera‚Äôs settings are the following, and I still don‚Äôt know what many of them actually do.
Whatsapp on iOS has the following settings for notifications:
New message > note and Group message > note isn‚Äôt quite easy to understand. Note is actually the tone which comes when a new message comes.
Car owners can relate to this: You lock the car and want to be sure, you pull the door and reassure yourself. In a scenario where you‚Äôve parked the car, locked it and went inside a building. You can‚Äôt remember if you‚Äôve locked it or have left it unlocked. Just to be sure you decide to go near the car and use your remote to lock it. But what if you had an indicator on your remote which showed the status of your car?
People cannot always remember the current status in which they‚Äôve configured the product. They think they‚Äôve configured it the wrong way and have second thoughts on what was the choice they made for a particular setting.
Misleading, icon driven and abbreviated labels often confuse product owners. As a thumb rule its better if the labels are descriptive in nature. If your product contains labels like General settings, Advanced settings, Options and Preferences user doesn‚Äôt know where to find something. In my camera (above) there are four tabs for camera‚Äôs image settings. How will anyone know whats in each tab? Or in whatsapp (above) how can one relate New Message > Note to the tone of notifications? The correct label would have been a variant of ‚ÄúNew message sound‚Äù or ‚ÄúNew message Tone.‚Äù
Product designers ship the product with a default configuration, which they think is the best way to use the product. In certain cases the default settings are not universal, and unless the user sets the preferences the product is rendered useless.
A highly configurable product like the browser has way too many settings. Wayfinding is not so easy and in such cases searching a setting solves many problems. If your products has a lot of configurable options its always good to have a search.
Grouping helps people find their way to the desired configuration. There are two ways of grouping configurations the first is based on usage and the other is descriptive grouping.
Usage based groupingOn a broad level you could group all the configurations in two, general settings and advanced settings. When trying to do the grouping based on usage data plays an important role. Data alone can determine what‚Äôs a general setting and whats an advanced setting.
Based on the usage you could also give a quick settings option with the most frequently changed configurations. Nod32 an antivirus software does a great job by having the most frequently modified settings in a tab on the main screen.
Collect data to determine the usage of each configuration and come up with with a grouping based on usage. You could as well create a small questionnaire to ask what are the preferences of product owners. Based on the obtained data choose how much configurability to provide.
Descriptive groupingA logical grouping with easily understandable group names add a lot to findability. You can employ several methods to come up with the most optimal grouping to structure the configurations.
Card sorting could be used to structure the settings in the best way. There are several ways in which you could do card sorting, choose the best way that suits your need.
Always include a helper text for settings that are not easily understandable. Android guidelines have specified settings as a pattern in material design and they insist on having a secondary text as description for switch settings.
Products should work for the user and not the other way around. The product can learn the way owner wants to use it on the first launch. If your product provides email notifications let the user choose how frequently to receives them. Instead of deciding a default configuration, in certain cases we could ask the product owner to set it.
For every application, iOS permissions for notifications are asked at the first launch.
Settings however used very infrequently are an important aspect of your product. When designing settings use clear titles and helper texts for not so straightforward settings. Make sure the settings are easy to find, make use of a search or group settings in a structured manner. A snapshot of the current status of the configuration helps users to choose the right setting.

Now on to the original article.
by Michael Horton | VP Product and UX/UI Designer at PhoneWagon
We have been living in a world of ‚Äòclean and minimal‚Äô for quite some time, so what‚Äôs next?
Over the last several months, some of the leaders of innovative design have taken ‚Äòminimal design‚Äô to the next level. Facebook, Airbnb and Apple have followed a similar blueprint to simplify prominent products in a way that reflects this new trend of ‚ÄòComplexion Reduction‚Äô in mobile design.
You‚Äôve never heard of ‚ÄòComplexion Reduction‚Äô you say? Well yea, that‚Äôs because I just made the term up. Recently I‚Äôve noticed a new trend that is beyond flat design, beyond minimal design and independent of progressive reduction. Some may claim that this is just the next step of minimal design being implemented into the mobile realm but I say it is something more distinct. There are specific similarities and characteristics that define this new trend. So I decided to name it. I‚Äôm allowed to do that, right?
The defining characteristics of this hot new trend sweeping across Silicon Valley are:
The result? The user interfaces of some of our favorite apps are starting to look more and more like they could all be housed under the same brand.
I first started taking notice of this trend back in early May when Instagram released their redesigned UI.
Some of the changes they introduced included removing much of the blue and dark grey color used throughout the app, making headlines bolder and simplifying the bottom navigation and icons. What was left was a black and white UI with bold headlines where the content shined and functionality was clear. I appreciated the less cluttered interface and was reminded a bit of a platform I have been an admirer of for quite some time; Medium. Medium has been rocking the black and white since launch in 2012, and has reduced clutter with each redesign since; effectively making Medium one of the originators of CR (Complexion Reduction) without even knowing it. Congratulations, Medium!
Shortly after the folks over at FB unveiled Instagram‚Äôs look, I opened up the Airbnb app and was struck by how familiar it looked. This was my first time browsing the app since they released a redesign in April, yet I felt like I had seen this all before.
Airbnb‚Äôs redesigned UI didn‚Äôt get nearly the media coverage of Instagram‚Äôs redesign a month later (partly because it wasn‚Äôt accompanied by a shiny new app icon) but it followed many of the same CR tactics.
The mobile redesign introduced larger, bolder headlines, removed unnecessary imagery and color and simplified their icons to make them more universally recognizable. What was left was a very black and white UI where the content shined and functionality was clear.
Apple is the latest example of designers becoming enamored by the Complexion Reduction movement. Earlier this month, at Apple‚Äôs WWDC the tech giant announced a number of exciting things for consumers to look forward to, including the release of iOS 10, which they are dubbing, ‚ÄúThe biggest iOS release ever!‚Äù (or at least since iOS 8 which was referred to as... ‚ÄúThe biggest iOS release ever!‚Äù)
One announcement in particular caught my eye. That was the redesign of Apple Music. While the most important aspects of the redesign are UX updates and additional features, the aesthetic was the first thing I noticed. Caitlin McGarry, a staff writer at Macworld, described the updated appearance well, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a totally new look, with giant cards, bigger and bolder fonts, and a clean white background that allows the album art to shine.‚Äù
Sound familiar? The design differs slightly from the blueprint used by Instagram and Airbnb (they use solid icons! What the heck Apple?) but the key elements are there: large bold headlines, black and white UI.
As I mentioned earlier, this means more and more of your favorite apps are going to start looking like one another. Why? Much like the NFL, tech is a copycat league. These redesigns were met with generally positive reviews (some people are complaining about a ‚Äòlack of personality‚Äô in these new black and white UIs but they‚Äôll soon get over that. You open an app for it‚Äôs functionality, not it‚Äôs personality) so I expect apps both new and old to start jumping on the CR bandwagon.
Now, whether you are for or against this monochromatic fad, it is undoubtedly a sign of progress. The product design process is advancing and evolving from the old segmented approach that encouraged superfluous design to a more holistic process that truly is focused on the user. In the old product design process a UI designer may be handed wireframes by a UX or product person with the instructions ‚Äòmake it pretty‚Äô. That designer would then spend hours or days adding color, removing color, changing color when the best solution may have been right there in front of them all along... the wireframes! As the lines between UX and UI designer blur in today‚Äôs more integrated design process, designers become less worried about their specific responsibilities (like making it pretty) and focus on the ultimate goal of creating the best product for their user.
So you‚Äôre sold on CR and ready to hop on the bandwagon? Good, follow these guidelines and you‚Äôll have an award winning app in no time.
Thanks for reading! Hit the heart if you enjoyed.

Nick Babich|5.4K|7|https://uxplanet.org/perfect-bottom-navigation-for-mobile-app-effabbb98c0f?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|UX Design for Mobile: Bottom Navigation ‚Äì UX Planet|"Designers know that design is more than good looks. Design also covers how users engage with a product, whether it‚Äôs a website or app. It‚Äôs like a conversation. Navigation is a conversation. Because it doesn‚Äôt matter how good your site or app is if users can‚Äôt find their way around it.
Steven Hoober in his research of mobile devices usage, found that 49% of people rely on a one thumb to get things done on their phones. In figure below, the diagram that appears on the mobile phones‚Äô screens are approximate reach charts, in which the colors indicate what areas a user can reach with the thumb to interact with the screen. Green indicates the area a user can reach easily; yellow, an area that requires a stretch; and red, an area that requires users to shift the way in which they‚Äôre holding a device.
It‚Äôs important to place top-level and frequently-used actions at the bottom of the screen, because they are comfortably reached with one-thumb interactions.
Many apps follow this rule and use the bottom navigation (a.k.a. tab bar) for the most important app‚Äôs features. Facebook makes main pieces of core functionality available with one tap, allows rapid switching between features.
Navigation is generally the vehicle that takes users where they want to go. And bottom navigation should be used for the top-level destinations of similar importance. These destinations requiring direct access from anywhere in the app.
Good bottom navigation design follows these three rules.
Use three to five top-level destinations in bottom navigation. If there are fewer than three destinations, consider using tabs instead.
Avoid using more than five destinations in bottom navigation as tap targets will be situated too close to one another. Putting too many tabs in a tab bar can make it physically difficult for people to tap the one they want. And with each additional tab you display, you increase the complexity of your app.
If your top-level navigation has more than five destinations, provide access to destinations not covered in bottom navigation through alternative locations.
Partially hidden navigation is a pretty obvious solution for small screens ‚Äî you don‚Äôt have to worry about the limited screen estate, just place your navigation options into a scrollable tab. But scrollable content is less efficient, since you have to scroll once before you‚Äôre even allowed to see the option you want.
Failing to indicate the current location is probably the single most common mistake to see on apps menus. ‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù is one of the fundamental questions users need to answer to successfully navigate.
Users should know how to go from point A to point B based on their first glance and without any guidance from the outside. You should use the proper visual cues (icons, labels and colors) so that the navigation doesn‚Äôt require any explanation.
Because bottom navigation actions are presented as icons, they should be used for content that can be suitably communicated with icons. There are a universal icons that users know well, mostly those representing functionality like search, email, print and so on. Unfortunately ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù icons are rare. And app designers often hide functionality behind icons that are actually pretty hard to recognize.
I‚Äôve highlighted this problem in article Icons as Part of an Awesome User Experience.
Avoid using different colored icons and text labels in your bottom tab bar. Instead use the app‚Äôs primary color to indicate the view in focus.
Follow a simple rule ‚Äî tint the current bottom navigation action (including the icon and any text label present) with the app‚Äôs primary color.
If the bottom navigation bar is colored, make the icon and text label of the current action black or white.
Text labels should provide short and meaningfully definitions to navigation icons. Avoid long text labels as these labels do not truncate or wrap.
Menu elements should be easy to scan. Users should be able to understand what exactly happens when they tap on a element.
Make targets big enough to be easily tapped or clicked. To calculate the width of each bottom navigation action, divide the width of the view by the number of actions. Alternatively, make all bottom navigation actions the width of the largest action.
Android guideline suggest following dimensions for the bottom navigation bar on mobile.
You can display a badge on a tab bar icon to indicate that there is new information associated with that view or mode.
Good navigation should feel like an invisible hand that guides the user along their journey. After all, even the coolest feature or the most compelling content is useless if people can‚Äôt find it.
Each bottom navigation icon must lead to a target destination, and may not open menus or other pop-ups. Tapping on a bottom navigation icon should guide user directly to the associated view, or refreshes the currently active view.
Don‚Äôt use a tab bar to give users controls that act on elements in the current screen or app mode. If you need to provide controls use a toolbar instead.
As much as possible, display the same tabs in every orientation. It‚Äôs best when you can give users a sense of visual stability by providing the same tabs in every orientation.
Don‚Äôt remove a tab when its function is unavailable. If you remove a tab in some cases but not in others, you make your app‚Äôs UI unstable and unpredictable. The best solution is to ensure that all tabs are enabled, but explain why a tab‚Äôs content is unavailable. For example, if the user doesn‚Äôt have offline files, the Offline tab in the Dropbox app displays a screen that explains how to have them. This feature called Empty state.
If the screen is a scrolling feed, the tab bar can be hidden when people scrolling for new content and revealed if they start pulling down trying to get back to the top.
Avoid using lateral motion to transition between views. Transition between active and inactive views should use a cross-fade animation.
Bottom navigation should be
Helping users navigate should be a high priority for almost every site and app. The goal behind this moments is to create an interaction system that naturally aligns with the user‚Äôs mental models.
You‚Äôre designing for your users. Always think about your user persona, think about the goals they have when using your app, and use your navigation to help them meet those goals. The easier your product is for them to use, the more likely they‚Äôll be to use it.

Developers will thank you!|"After weighing the pros and cons of Sketch & Zeplin before start using them, it seemed like there were much more pros than cons, but you still have the same workload and difficulties to communicate with the development team. You find yourself wondering whether developers don‚Äôt know how to use a so simple tool like Zeplin.
You have just uploaded all your designs to Zeplin and suddenly you receive a message from one of the developers asking you to export all your icons and images and send them in a zip file. And you wonder, why don‚Äôt they download them directly from Zeplin? They told you to upload a screenshot to Zeplin because they cannot see the margins between the items... and you think, then what purpose does this tool serve?
If one of these things are happening to you, this article is for you. These are the 10 things that will help you to get the most out of your time and find a happy medium with developers.
In which devices your product will be seen? Define the breakpoints and keep in mind the media queries that developers are going to use. Talk with your developer if you don‚Äôt know what it is.
Upload an artwork to Zeplin with the responsive design (according to the breakpoints that you‚Äôve already set), in other words, share how your design looks in different screen resolutions and devices.
You think it‚Äòs clear that the design will be horizontally center at higher resolutions, such as 1920 x 1080 pixels, but developers are not mind readers.
Assign the maximum size to the raster images to avoid loss of quality when the design is displayed on screens with higher resolutions. For example, if you are working on an app for iOS, set the size of the images to @3x. If you don‚Äôt do this, you‚Äôll get a message from the developer like the following:
Developers may be interested to export one or more of the elements of your icon, or the full icon. So make all items exportable separately and as group. Later in Zeplin, the dev team will be able to export individual assets as well as the full group.
Imagine a banner that contains an image, a text and a filter, and the filter cannot be built with CSS. Then, developers have to be able to export:
The line-height of the body text has to be 6px more than the current font-size, exception can be titles or overlay texts where you want to impact the user by empowering the graphics of an element.
Then, check the line-heights of the different text boxes. Keep in mind developer is going to select a text box and copy and paste the line-height. Set the same line-height in all of the text boxes to save coherence along your design.
Set the width of a single line text to ‚Äòauto‚Äô. This will allow your dev team to view the margin between the text and other elements of the interface, or the boundaries of the screen design.
Some of the icons that you import in Sketch have a surrounding area, which is good to export the asset, but is tough for developer when he tries to check the margin between objects in Zeplin. Remove this space to allow developers to be able to check the margin between the icon and the next element of the interface.
You‚Äôve done your design in Sketch and you‚Äôve uploaded the screens to Zeplin. Now comes up the developer‚Äôs question.
Create a new artwork with all of the states for the different components that you are using in the interface, You can name it ‚ÄòSpecs‚Äô.
Zeplin allows you to organize the screens by tags. You can sort your screens designs by content (for example, the sections of your website) or functionalities.
Sort the screens following the user flow into each of the tags (section or functionality). That way, the first screen in Zeplin will be the first screen in your website or app.
Don‚Äôt waste your time creating a styleguide, you can add the colors and typographies directly from Zeplin (Styleguide tab).
PD: Don‚Äôt forget to invite the development team to your Zeplin‚Äôs project!
Hope this helps, let me know if you have any questions!

I remember the first time I really experienced the power of shortcuts. A friend of mine did 3D modeling in Autodesk Maya, and I asked him to show me one of his projects. As he manipulated the canvas, I watched in disbelief as his hands never touched the mouse. He was zooming in and out, selecting and moving vertices, positioning the camera, and creating new objects on the screen...all from the keyboard.
According to him, he hadn‚Äôt had a mouse in two or three months, and couldn‚Äôt really be bothered to get one, so he just taught himself how to get by without it.
I thought he was crazy, but was silently fascinated by his ability to operate such a complicated application so nimbly and masterfully without the single-most necessary input device in computing.
But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs uncommon. When you use an application every day, whether you‚Äôre a creative or an accountant, you start to crave efficiencies ‚Äî tiny little things you can do to make your job faster and easier ‚Äî so you can spend time doing more important things like hanging around the water cooler to talk about the latest season of Stranger Things.
The first week or so of learning a new shortcut or hotkey will be strictly recall. You might even need to write it down. The trick is to force yourself to use the shortcut at all costs, even if it means taking the time to look it up.
You‚Äôre training your brain to learn the keys, and your muscles to remember the shapes the shortcuts form on the keyboard.
After the first week, muscle memory takes over. You won‚Äôt have to look at the keyboard for Command-Shift-J (reveal layer in layer list) or Control-Command-H (distribute objects horizontally). Before you know it, you‚Äôll have a large toolbox of efficiency tricks that save you hours throughout the week.
Here are some techniques I use to speed up my Sketch workflow:
If this is the only thing you learn from this article, then it‚Äôs a win for us both.
Open your system preferences and find the Keyboard panel. Did you know that you can create your own custom keyboard shortcuts for any menu item in any application?
I remember being frustrated that seemingly-common actions in Sketch (alignment, in particular) didn‚Äôt have default shortcuts out of the box. Luckily, I learned how easy it was to create application-specific shortcuts in this hidden Mac menu.
The syntax is simple. Start by finding the action in the Sketch menu (use Help if you can‚Äôt find it).
Once you‚Äôve located the action, write down the menu map that gets you to that action, separating each ‚Äústep‚Äù with a ‚Äú->‚Äù. That‚Äôs a hyphen then a greater than symbol. Don‚Äôt forget the top menu.
So the menu map for ‚ÄúAlign Objects Left‚Äù would be:
Make sure you don‚Äôt add any extra spaces. Once you‚Äôve written out the menu mapping, click into the Keyboard Shortcut box and assign a key combination that will trigger this action. Don‚Äôt make it too obscure...if it‚Äôs align left, use something obvious like Control-Command-Left Arrow.
I promise I‚Äôm not affiliated with BetterTouchTool, but I am a massive fan. BetterTouchTool is the absolute best application for taking control of your Mac and making it work the way you want.
The app lets you configure and perform actions using all kinds of methods: via keyboard, mouse, trackpad, drawing, Siri, Apple Remote, and more. Shortcut actions can be set to work globally or only in specific applications.
My four favorite BetterTouchTool actions help me align objects in Sketch. You‚Äôll first have to create menu maps and shortcuts using the Apple Keyboard shortcut menu from Tip #1, then you can assign this shortcut to trigger however you want.
Here are four that I‚Äôve configured that I could not live without:
These gestures have become so second-nature to me that it‚Äôs painful to work on other computers that don‚Äôt have them configured. I‚Äôve found a trackpad gesture to be far superior than just a keyboard shortcut because I don‚Äôt have to reach for the keys. It‚Äôs such a natural movement to ‚Äúflick‚Äù an object to the left to align it to the left.
Oh, for you mouse users? Just...I don‚Äôt know...stop? I kid, I kid. But really, I‚Äôve found the trackpad to be 10x more efficient (not necessarily faster!) than a mouse. Multitouch gestures make things feel natural, and you literally have a wealth of actions at your fingertips. I mean look at all the gestures my trackpad is picking up:
If we‚Äôre getting technical, yes, the Magic Mouse is both a trackpad and a mouse, but after using it for about a year, I still found a trackpad to be better.
Just a personal preference!
But really, you should just use a trackpad.
One of the handiest plugins for Sketch has to be the Content Generator. You can use it to quickly generate placeholder text, names, profile pictures, etc. If you‚Äôve never used it, download it now.
If I had a nickel for every time I‚Äôve had to generate a list of names or fill a list with profile pictures, I swear I could host a catered In-N-Out Burger lunch for every food delivery tech startup in The Valley.
There are four main actions I perform with the Content Generator on a regular basis, and they‚Äôre all very related:
I rarely perform one without the other(s), so I created shortcuts to run these actions for me. Each action in the shortcut ‚Äúgroup‚Äù begins with Control+Alt+Command combination, then I use modifier keys next to each other on the keyboard to fire the desired action:
By grouping these shortcuts in close proximity to each other, it‚Äôs less cognitive load for me to remember all of them individually. I effectively get four shortcuts for the price of one. It‚Äôs simple to remember F for ‚Äúfemale‚Äù, and I know the female name shortcut is the key just below it.
Don‚Äôt stop at Sketch shortcuts! As any great designer knows, you‚Äôll be switching between Sketch and at least four other applications hundreds of times per day while you work:
Command+Tab is useful for switching between adjacent apps (that is, the app you were in before the current one), but you have to hit tab a couple times to visit apps further back in your focus history, and we all know that you‚Äôll pass over the right app at least once.
Spotlight is useful for opening apps, but you still have to type the name of the app, and depending on what Spotlight is indexing on your computer, you might end up opening something like ‚Äúsketches_nov2015.png‚Äù on accident instead of Sketch the app.
Instead, I use shortcuts to open my favorite apps:
In the image above, notice that these are global shortcuts, so they will override any local application shortcut. That means I know with 100% certainty that Control+Option+S will open Sketch (or bring it into focus) every single time. Pretty convenient in the long run.
Don‚Äôt forget: Use an obvious modifier letter so you don‚Äôt forget the shortcut. That is, don‚Äôt launch Sketch with the letter Q, unless you‚Äôre going for ‚ÄúQuite Extraordinary Design Application‚Äù...
But that would just be silly.
Brace yourselves for some shocking news:
Have you ever used this online search engine called Google? It‚Äôs pretty popular. If not, you should check it out.
We‚Äôre in the Google Age where you can type exactly what you want and Google will magically find what you‚Äôre looking for. If you don‚Äôt think this is the most magical thing to happen to planet Earth in the last billion years, then I bet you weren‚Äôt all that impressed with Hamilton, either. For shame.
Here‚Äôs the thing. Spotlight on your shiny Mac works just about the same way. You can configure it to search whatever the H you want it to, and when you conjure up Spotlight with Command+Spacebar, it will search for only those types of things on your computer.
Stop thumbing your way through Finder to locate a design file like Don Draper flipping through his paper Rolodex. This is the 21st Century and you‚Äôre smarter than that! Just type in the name of the file, press Enter, and presto! The file is open.
Note: If you‚Äôre typing in an application name, it will show you the most recent files on the right side. It‚Äôs a convenient way to recall a recent file if you can‚Äôt remember the name of it.
There you have it! Five slick ways to work faster and more efficiently! Now you have extra time to work on that callipygian figure of yours üçë. If you don‚Äôt get that reference, then you didn‚Äôt read the article :)

Chris Gliddon|225|3|https://chrisgliddon.com/the-tragic-story-of-vernon-and-oswald-7540fa359509?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|The Tragic Story of Vernon and Oswald ‚Äì Gliddon's Blog|"Occasionally, you stumble upon a sad story you missed, and can‚Äôt help but feel compelled to share it. And no, this has nothing to do with the new president of the United States.
Tonight I wanted to see who designed the Oswald typeface, since I‚Äôve been using it for a big project, and I believe in supporting font designers (aka typographers).
Since I‚Äôd picked up the font for free, I wasn‚Äôt sure what the license agreement would be to use this typeface ‚Äî would it be an MIT license, a GNU agreement, or something else? I pulled up Font Squirrel, clicked on the name of the designer (Vernon Adams), checked out his GitHub account, and learned that this typographer also created some of my other favourites, such as Francois One and Pacifico. Curious to learn more, I opened the link to Vernon‚Äôs personal website. I didn‚Äôt expect to see what I found next.
I learned that Vernon Adams, a father of two, was involved in a major scooter accident in 2014. Due to the severity of his injuries, he passed away on August 24, 2016 ‚Äìjust a few short months ago. His wife Allison was left behind with their 6-year old daughter and 14-year old son. He was 49 years old.
Vernon was the creator of many of the most popular fonts in the Google Font library. Without exaggeration, Vernon‚Äôs fonts have billions of views. His most popular creation, Oswald, a reworking of the classic Alternate Classic typeface, has over 506.4 billion lifetime views via Google Fonts, with many of his other fonts topping the charts as well. Oxygen has 42 billion views, and Nunito, Muli, and Francois One have each been cracked the 30+ billion view count mark as well. To see just how many fonts he created and how many views each one has, check out Google Font Analytics and search for ‚ÄúVernon Adams‚Äù ‚Äî the results are staggering.
Here‚Äôs the part that hit me in the heart: Vernon‚Äôs family receives no royalties for his massive library of fonts. He was paid ‚Äòup-front‚Äô for his creations, which were then uploaded to the web for use without royalties. This means that Vernon Adams‚Äô surviving family no longer has his income to depend on, and there is no inbound stream of royalties available to help pay their bills. It seems he didn‚Äôt have life insurance, either.
Allison is running a fundraiser on YouCaring to raise funds for their family. As someone who has made extensive use of Vernon‚Äôs fonts, I plan to chip in a bit to honour his legacy and help his surviving family.
I know I‚Äôm probably a bit late to the party in discovering this news, but I thought it was so heartbreaking that I felt compelled to write about it. I believe there are no coincidences in life, and that I found this story for a reason. I hope that in some small way, this little post helps honour Vernon Adams and his family. I‚Äôm sure it would also mean a lot to them if you could share his story with your network to help generate more support to keep their family afloat.
As you can see, they‚Äôre well below their crowdfunding goal, with only 117 people having contributed. I think we can do better than that. If nothing else, it‚Äôs a positive thing we can do on a day when many folks are fearful of the future of their country. Instead, we can focus on doing something kind for someone. Maybe you‚Äôre not passionate about giving to Vernon‚Äôs family, but instead for another cause that matters to you. In any case, I can think of no better time than now to do something positive for another human being in need. Trump‚Äôs campaign message was to ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù, and that‚Äôs a bloody good way to put that idea into action, regardless of your political leanings.
And with that, I‚Äôm off to design some stuff with fonts created by a talented typographer named Vernon Adams, who left this world much too soon.

It‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of wanting one team member to take on the responsibilities of multiple roles. With design, it‚Äôs unfortunate yet common enough for teams to have their engineering talent handle the task. But there is an opportunity cost of having developers partition their workflow to do design and development, giving them less time to do the work they excel at. Plus, design will likely take them more time than someone who is familiar with design tools.
Furthermore, design is not like code, in that you don‚Äôt have to be technical to see it‚Äôs results, making everyone a critic. However, it‚Äôs one thing to critique design it‚Äôs another to create it. So when your developer wants to do UX/UI design on your product, do like Nancy Reagan, and ‚ÄúJust Say No‚Äù. Your developers should be focused on the things they excel at.
Audiences today require fluid UX and premium interaction design. This isn‚Äôt just something that can be done overnight; it requires experience to truly understand how to deliver this.
Why is design important?
Trust: Consumers generally trust familiarly and ‚Äúwell‚Äù designed products, not something your cousin Timmy whipped up. When you have to choose between two similar products in the Play Store, see if you feel more secure with the modernly designed product or the one that looks like a sub-reddit.
Design is key to audience ‚Äî Business to Consumer (B2C) needs to match the defined customer base, while Business to Business (B2B) is often a lot more forgiving with visuals. With a solid B2B product, teams generally feel they can get away with no design, but what about when a similar product with better design hits the market?
User Experience: Visual design is important ‚Äî but on its own it‚Äôs nothing more than eye-candy. The interface should be able to enhance the core functions and create a comfortable experience for your users.
When is design less important?
Minimal Viable Products (MVPs) don‚Äôt always need the same level of design refinement as full products. That doesn‚Äôt mean they should ignore design, but sometimes it‚Äôs better to spend resources testing and validating in a market first.
What does design actually provide, then?
In addition to the trust factor for your customers (which is hugely important), it creates a level of ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù in the general space ‚Äî meaning investors, friends, and family are more likely to believe in your product, as well as keeping competitors from choosing to join the market.
More importantly that appearance and assumptions, design is your chance to brand your product. Users are humans ‚Äî that means they‚Äôre going to respond emotionally to pretty much everything, including using your product. They‚Äôre going to feel frustrated, annoyed, grateful, impressed and have an internal conversation when they engage with software. It‚Äôs the moment your customers start having an emotional relationship with your company.
Design is when you get to make your audience feel ‚Äî wouldn‚Äôt you want to be in control of that dialogue?

Issara Willenskomer|58K|21|https://medium.com/ux-in-motion/creating-usability-with-motion-the-ux-in-motion-manifesto-a87a4584ddc?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|Creating Usability with Motion: The UX in Motion Manifesto|"The following manifesto represents my answer to the question ‚Äî ‚ÄúAs a UX or UI, designer, how do I know when and where to implement motion to support usability?‚Äù
Over the last 5 years, it has been my privilege to coach and mentor UX & UI designers in over 40 countries, and at hundreds of the top brands and design consultancies through my workshops and tutorials on UI Animation.
After over fifteen years studying motion in user interfaces, I have come to the conclusion that there are 12 specific opportunities to support usability in your UX projects using motion.
I call these opportunities ‚ÄòThe 12 Principles of UX in Motion,‚Äô and they can be stacked and combined synergistically in a myriad of innovative ways.
I‚Äôve broken the manifesto into 5 parts:
As a quick plug, if you are interested in having me lead a motion and usability workshop for your team, click here for more info: https://uxinmotion.net/creating-usability-with-motion-workshop/
Because the topic of motion in user interfaces is mostly understood by designers to be ‚ÄòUI Animation‚Äô‚Äîwhich it is not ‚Äî I feel like I need to create a bit of context before we jump into the 12 Principles.
‚ÄòUI Animation‚Äô is typically thought of by designers as something that makes the user experience more delightful, but overall doesn‚Äôt add much value. Thus, UI Animation is often treated like the red-headed stepchild of UX (apologies to red-headed stepchildren everywhere). If at all, it usually comes at the end, as a final lipstick pass.
Additionally, motion in the context of user interfaces has understandably been held to be under the domain of Disney‚Äôs 12 Principles of Animation, something I argue against in my article ‚ÄòUI Animation Principles ‚Äî Disney is Dead.‚Äô
In my manifesto, I will be making the case that UI Animation is to the ‚Äò12 UX in Motion Principles‚Äô as construction is to architecture.
By this I mean, that while a structure needs to be physically built to exist (requiring construction), the guiding hand which determines what gets built comes from the domain of Principles.
Animation is all about tools. Principles are the practical application of ideas that guide the usage of tools and as such, Principles provide high leverage opportunities for designers.
What most designers think of as ‚ÄòUI Animation‚Äô is in fact the execution of a higher modality of design: the temporal behavior of interface objects during realtime and non-realtime events.
At this juncture, it is important to distinguish between ‚Äòstate‚Äô and ‚Äòact.‚Äô The state of something in UX is fundamentally static, like a design comp. The act of something in UX is fundamentally temporal, and motion based. An object can be in the state of being masked or it can be in the act of being masked. If it is the latter, we know that motion is involved and in a way that could support usability.
Additionally, all temporal aspects of interaction can be thought of as happening in realtime or non-realtime. Realtime means that the user is directly interacting with the objects in the user interface. Non-realtime means that the object behavior is post-interactive: it occurs after a user action, and is transitional.
This is an important distinction.
Realtime interactions can also be thought of as ‚Äòdirect manipulation,‚Äô in that the user is interacting with the interface objects directly and immediately. The behavior of the interface is happening as the user is using it.
Non-realtime interactions happen only after input from the user and have the effect of briefly locking the user out of the user experience until the transition completes.
These distinctions will give us leverage as we continue our journey into the world of the 12 Principles of UX in Motion.
These four pillars represent the four ways where the temporal behavior of user experiences supports usability.
Expectation fall into two areas ‚Äî how users perceive what an object is, and how it behaves. Another way of saying this is that as designers, we want to minimize the gap between what the user expects, and what they experience.
Continuity speaks both to the user flow and to the ‚Äòconsistency‚Äô of the user experience. Continuity can be thought of in terms of ‚Äòintra-continuity‚Äô ‚Äî the continuity within a scene, and ‚Äòinter-continuity‚Äô ‚Äî the continuity within a series of scenes that make up the total user experience.
Narrative is the linear progression of events in the user experience that results in a temporal/spatial framework. This can be thought of as the series of discreet moments and events that connect together throughout the user experience.
Relationship refers to the spatial, temporal, and hierarchal representations between interface objects that guide user understanding and decision making.
Tyler Waye says it as good as any when he writes, ‚ÄúPrinciples... are the underlying premises and rules of function giving rise to any number of techniques. These elements remain consistent, no matter what is happening.‚Äù It bears repeating that Principles are agnostic of design.
From there, we can imagine a hierarchy with Principles at the top, Techniques further down, Properties below that, and Values at the bottom.
Techniques can be thought of as the various and unlimited executions of Principles and/or combination of Principles. I think of technique as akin to ‚Äòstyle.‚Äô
Properties are the specific object parameters that are being animated to create the technique. These include (and are not limited to) position, opacity, scale, rotation, anchor point, color, stroke-width, shape, etc.
Values are the actual numeric property values that vary over time to create what we call ‚Äòanimation.‚Äô
So to land the plane here (and jumping ahead a bit), we could say that a hypothetical UI animation reference is using the Obscuration Principle with a ‚Äòblurred glass‚Äô Technique that affects the Blur and Opacity Properties at a Value of 25px and 70% respectively.
Now we have some tools to work with. And more importantly, these linguistic tools are agnostic of any specific prototyping tool.
Easing and Offset & Delay relate to timing. Parenting relates to object relationship. Transformation, Value Change, Masking, Overlay, and Cloning all relate to object continuity. Parallax relate to temporal hierarchy. Obscuration, Dimensionality and Dolly & Zoom both relate to spatial continuity.
Object behavior aligns with user expectations when temporal events occur.
All interface objects exhibiting temporal behavior (whether realtime or non-realtime), ease. Easing creates and reinforces the ‚Äònaturalism‚Äô inherent in the seamlessness of user experiences, and creates a sense of continuity when objects behave as users expect them to. Incidentally, Disney refers to this as ‚ÄòSlow In and Slow Out.‚Äô
The example on the left has linear motion and looks ‚Äòbad.‚Äô The first example up top has eased motion and looks ‚Äògood.‚Äô All three above examples have the exact number of frames and take place over the exact same amount of time. The only difference is in their easing.
As designers concerned with usability, we need to require of ourselves rigor and inquire, aside from aesthetics, which example supports usability more?
The case I am presenting here is that a certain degree of skeuomorphism is inherent in easing. You can imagine an ‚Äòeasing gradient‚Äô wherein behaviors that fall outside user expectations result in less usable interactions. In the case of properly eased motion, users experience the motion itself as seamless and largely invisible ‚Äî which is a good thing in that it is non-distracting. Linear motion is visibly obvious and feels somehow off, unfinished, and jarring, and distracting.
Now I‚Äôm going to completely contradict myself here and talk about the example on the right. The motion isn‚Äôt seamless. In fact, it has a ‚Äòdesigned‚Äô feel to it. We notice how the object lands. It feels different, yet it still feels more ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô than the example with linear motion.
Can you employ easing and still have it not support (or worse case undermine) usability? The answer is yes, and there are several ways. One way is timing. If your timing is too slow (mushy to borrow from Pasquele), or too fast, you can break expectation and distract user attention. Similarly, if your easing is misaligned with the brand or overall experience, this can also negatively impact expectation and seamlessness.
What I want to open you to is a world of opportunity when it comes to eased motion. There are literally an infinite number of ‚Äòeasings‚Äô that you as a designer can create and implement in your projects. All of these easings have their own expectation response they trigger in users.
To summarize: when to use easing? Always.
You can learn more on my easing hypothesis in my article, ‚ÄòThe irony of usability and linear motion.‚Äô
Defines object relationships and hierarchies when introducing new elements and scenes.
Offset & Delay is the second of only two UX in Motion Principles that is influenced by Disney‚Äôs Animation Principles, in this case from ‚ÄòFollow Through and Overlapping Action.‚Äô
It is important to note, however, that the implementation, while similar in execution, differs in purpose and outcome. While Disney‚Äôs Principles result in ‚Äòmore appealing animations,‚Äô the UI Animation Principles result in more usable experiences.
The utility of this principle is that it pre-consciously sets the user up for success by ‚Äòtelling‚Äô the user something about the nature of the objects in the interface. The narrative in the above reference is that the top two objects are united and the bottom object is separate. Perhaps the top two objects could be a non-interactive image and text, while the bottom object is a button.
Even before the user registers what these objects are, the designer has already communicated to her‚Äîthrough motion ‚Äî that the objects are somehow ‚Äòseparate.‚Äô This is extremely powerful.
In the above example, the floating action button (FAB) transforms into header navigation elements comprised of three buttons. Because the buttons are ‚Äòoffset‚Äô from each other temporally, they end up supporting usability through their ‚Äòseparateness.‚Äô Said differently, the designer is using time itself to say ‚Äî even before the user registers what the objects are ‚Äî that the objects are separate. This has the effect of telling the user, completely independent from the visual design, part of the nature of the objects in the interface.
To better show you how this works, I‚Äôll show you an example that breaks the Offset & Delay Principle.
In the above example, the static visual design tells us that there are icons over a background. The presumption is that the icons are all separate from each other and do different things. However, the motion contradicts this.
Temporally, the icons are grouped into rows and behave like a single object. Their titles are likewise grouped into rows, and also behave like a single object. The motion is telling the user something other than what her eyes see. In this case, we can say that the temporal behavior of the objects in the interface are not supporting usability.
Creates spatial and temporal hierarchal relationships when interacting with multiple objects.
Parenting is a powerful Principle that ‚Äòrelates‚Äô objects in the user interface. In the above example, the ‚Äòscale‚Äô and ‚Äòposition‚Äô property of the top or ‚Äòchild‚Äô object is parented to the ‚Äòposition‚Äô property of the bottom or ‚Äòparent‚Äô object.
Parenting is the linking of object properties to other object properties. This creates object relationships and hierarchies in ways that support usability.
Parenting also allows designers to better coordinate temporal events in the user interface, while communicating to users the nature of the object relationships.
Recall that object Properties include the following ‚Äî Scale, Opacity, Position, Rotation, Shape, Color, Value, etc. Any of these Properties can be linked to any other Properties to create synergistic moments in the User Experience.
In this above left example, the ‚Äòy-axis‚Äô Property of the ‚Äòface‚Äô element is the ‚Äòchild‚Äô to the ‚Äòx-axis‚Äô Property of the round indicator parent. When the round indicator element moves along the horizontal axis, its ‚Äòchild‚Äô element moves along with it horizontally and vertically (while being Masked ‚Äî another Principle).
The result is a hierarchal temporal narrative framework that occurs all at the same time. Of note is that the ‚Äòfaces‚Äô object works as a series of ‚Äòlockups‚Äô in that, at each number, the ‚Äòface‚Äô is fully and not partially visible. The user experiences this seamlessly, though we can make the claim there is a subtle ‚Äòusability cheat‚Äô in this example.
Parenting functions best as a ‚Äòrealtime‚Äô interaction. As the user directly manipulates the interface objects, the designer communicates to the user ‚Äî via motion ‚Äî how the objects are linked, and the relationship between them.
Parenting occurs in 3 forms: ‚Äòdirect parenting‚Äô (see above two examples, ‚Äòdelayed parenting,‚Äô and ‚Äòinverse parenting,‚Äô see below).
Creates a continuous state of narrative flow when object utility changes.
Much has already been written about the UX in Motion Principle ‚Äòtransformation.‚Äô In some ways, it is the most obvious and penetrable of the animation principles.
Transformation is the most discernible, largely because it stands out. A ‚Äòsubmit‚Äô button changing shape to become a radial progress bar and finally changing shape again to become a confirmation check mark is something that we notice. It grabs our attention, tells a story, and has completion.
What Transformation does is seamlessly transition the user through the different UX states or ‚Äòis‚Äôs‚Äô (as in this is a button, this is a radial progress bar, this is a check mark) which eventually result in a desired outcome. The user has been drawn through these functional spaces to the ultimate destination.
Transformation has the effect of ‚Äòchunking‚Äô cognitively separate key moments in the user experience into a seamless and continuous series of events. This seamlessness results in better user awareness, retention, and followthrough.
Creates a dynamic and continuous narrative relationship when value subject changes.
Text based interface objects, that is to say numbers and text, can change their values. This is one of those ‚Äòelusive obvious‚Äô concepts.
Text and number changes are so common that they pass us by without us bringing to them distinction and rigor to assess their role in supporting usability
So what is the user experiencing when values change? In user experiences, the 12 UX in Motion Principles are opportunities to support usability. The three opportunities here are to connect the user to the reality behind the data, the concept of agency, and to the dynamic nature of the values themselves.
Let‚Äôs look at the example of a user dashboard.
When value based interface objects load with no ‚Äòvalue change,‚Äô what this conveys to the user is that the numbers are static objects. They‚Äôre like painted signs displaying a speed limit of 55 mph.
The numbers and values are representations of things that are happening in reality. That reality could be time, income, game scores, business metrics, fitness tracking, etc. What we are distinguishing through motion is that the ‚Äòvalue subject‚Äô is dynamic and the values are reflecting something from that dynamic value set.
Not only does this relationship get lost with static objects comprised visually of values, but another deeper opportunity is also lost.
When we employ representations of dynamic systems in the form of motion based values, it activates a sort of ‚Äòneurofeedback.‚Äô Users, grasping the dynamic nature of their data can now be cause in altering those values and are empowered to become agents. When the values are static, there is less connection to the reality behind the values, and users lose their agency.
The Value Change Principle can occur both in realtime and non-realtime events. In realtime events, the user is interacting with the objects to change values. In non-realtime events, such as loaders and transitions, the values change without user input to reflect a dynamic narrative.
Creates continuity in an interface object or object group when utility is determined by which part of the object or group is revealed or concealed.
The act of masking asking can be thought of as a relationship between the shape of the object and it‚Äôs utility.
Because designers are familiar with ‚Äòmasking‚Äô in the context of static design, it behooves us to bring distinction to the UX in Motion Principle ‚ÄòMasking‚Äô as it occurs in time, as an act, and not as a state.
Through the temporal use of revealing and concealing regions of an object, utility transitions in a continuous and seamless way. This also has the effect of preserving narrative flow.
In the above example, the header image changes bounding shape and position but not the content, and becomes an album. This has the effect of changing what the object is, while preserving the content within the mask ‚Äî a fairly neat trick. This occurs in non-realtime, as a transition, that is activated after a user takes an action.
Remember, UI Animation Principles occur temporally and support usability through continuity, narrative, relationship, and expectation. In the above reference, while the object itself remains unchanged, it also has boundary and location, and these two factors determine what the object is.
Creates narrative and object spatial relationship in visual flatland when layered objects are location dependent.
Overlay supports usability by allowing users to utilize flatland ordering properties to overcome a lack of non-spatial hierarchies.
To land the plane a bit, Overlay allows designers to use motion to communicate location dependent objects that exist behind or in front of others in non 3D space.
In the example on the left, the foreground object slides to the right to reveal the location of additional background objects. In the example on the right, the entire scene slides down to reveal additional content and options (while using the Offset & Delay Principle to communicate the individuality of the photo objects).
To a certain degree, as designers, the idea of ‚Äòlayers‚Äô is so obvious as to be self-evident. We design with layers and the concept of layers are deeply internalized. However, we must be careful to distinguish between the process of ‚Äòmaking‚Äô verses ‚Äòusing.‚Äô
As designers who are continually engaged in the process of ‚Äòmaking,‚Äô we are intimately familiar with all of the pieces of the object (including the hidden pieces) we are designing. As a user, however, those non visible pieces are by definition and practice, hidden both visually and cognitively.
The Overlay Principle allows designers to communicate relationship between ‚Äòz-axis‚Äô positioned layers and in so doing, promote spatial orientation to their users.
Creates continuity, relationship and narrative, when new objects originate and depart.
When new objects are created in current scenes (and from current objects), it is important to narratively account for their appearance. In this manifesto, I argue forcefully for the importance of creating a narrative framework for object origin and departure. Simple opacity fades tend to not achieve this result. Masking, Cloning, and Dimensionality are three usability based approaches to produce strong narratives.
In the above three examples, new objects are created from existing hero objects during the time the user‚Äôs attention is focused on those objects. This two fold approach ‚Äî the directing of attention, and then leading the eye through the creation of a cloned new object ‚Äî has the strong effect of communicating a clear and unambiguous chain of events: that action ‚Äòx‚Äô has the result ‚Äòy‚Äô of the creation of new child objects.
Allows users to spatially orient themselves in relationship to objects or scenes not in the primary visual hierarchy.
Similar to the UX in Motion Principles of Masking, Obscuration lives as both a static and temporal phenomena.
This can be confusing to designers who don‚Äôt have experience thinking temporally ‚Äî that is, the moments between moments. Designers typically design screen to screen or task to task. Think of Obscuration as the act of being obscured and not the state of being obscured. A static design represents the state of being obscured. Introducing time gives us the act of an object being obscured.
From the above two examples, we can see that obscuration, which looks like transparent objects or overlays, is also a temporal interaction involving multiple properties in time.
Various common techniques of this involve blur effects and a lessoning of overall object transparency. The user is made aware of an additional non primary context that she is operating in ‚Äî that there is another world, as it were, ‚Äòbehind‚Äô her primary object hierarchy.
Obscuration allows designers to compensate for a single unified field of view, or ‚Äòobjective view,‚Äô in user experiences.
Creates spatial hierarchy in visual flatland when users scroll.
‚ÄòParallax,‚Äô as a UX in Motion Principle describes different interface objects moving at different rates.
Parallax allows user to focus on primary actions and content while maintaining design integrity. Background elements ‚Äòrecede‚Äô perceptually and cognitively for the user during a Parallax event. Designers can use Parallax to separate out immediacy content from ambient or supportive content.
The effect this has on the user, is to clearly define for the duration of the interaction, the various object relationships. Foreground objects, or objects that move ‚Äòquicker‚Äô appear to the user as ‚Äòcloser.‚Äô Likewise, background objects or objects that move ‚Äòslower‚Äô are perceived as being ‚Äòfurther away.‚Äô
Designers can create these relationships, using time itself, to tell the user what objects in the interface are higher priority. Therefore it makes sense to push background or non-interactive elements further ‚Äòback.‚Äô
Not only does the user perceive the interface objects as now having a hierarchy beyond that which is determined in the visual design, but this hierarchy can now be leveraged into having the user grasp the nature of the user experience before being consciously aware of the design/content.
Provides a spatial narrative framework when new objects originate and depart.
Critical to User Experiences is the phenomenon of continuity as well as the sense of location.
Dimensionality provides a powerful way to overcome the flatland non-logic of User Experiences.
Humans are remarkably adept at using spatial frameworks to navigate both in the real world and in digital experiences. Providing spatial origin and departure references helps reinforce mental models of where users are in the UX.
Additionally, the Dimensionality Principle overcomes the layering paradox in visual flatland wherein objects lacking depth exist on the same plane but occur as ‚Äòin front of‚Äô or ‚Äòbehind‚Äô other objects.
Dimensionality presents itself in three ways ‚Äî Origami Dimensionality, Floating Dimensionality, and Object Dimensionality.
Origami Dimensionality can be thought of in terms of ‚Äòfolding‚Äô or ‚Äòhinged‚Äô three dimensional interface objects.
Because multiple objects are combined into ‚Äòorigami‚Äô structures, the hidden objects still can be said to ‚Äòexist,‚Äô spatially even though they are not visible. This effectively renders the User Experience as a continuous spatial event that the user navigates and creates an operating context both in the interaction model itself, and in the temporal behavior of the interface objects themselves.
Floating Dimensionality gives interface objects a spatial origin and departure, making the interaction models intuitive and highly narrative.
In the above example, Dimensionality is achieved through the use of 3D ‚Äòcards.‚Äô This provides a strong narrative framework that supports the visual design. The narrative is extended by ‚Äòflipping‚Äô the cards to access additional content and interactivity. Dimensionality can be a powerful way to introduce new elements in ways that minimize abruptness.
Object Dimensionality results in dimensional objects with true depth and form.
Here, multiple 2D layers are arranged in 3D space to form true dimensional objects. Their dimensionality is revealed during realtime and non-realtime transitional moments. The utility of Object Dimensionality is that users develop a keen awareness of object utility based on non-visible spatial locations.
Preserves continuity and spatial narrative when navigating interface objects and spaces.
Dolly and Zoom are filmic concepts referring to the movement of objects relevant to the camera, and the size of the image itself in the frame smoothly changing from a long shot to a close up shot (or vice versa).
In certain contexts, it is impossible to tell if an object is zooming, if it is moving towards the camera in 3D space, or if the camera is moving towards the object in 3D space (see below references). The below three examples illustrate the possible scenarios.
As such, it is appropriate to treat the instances of ‚Äòdollying‚Äô and ‚Äòzooming‚Äô as separate but similar in that they involve continuous element and scenic transformations, and meet the requirements of the UX in Motion Principles: they support usability through motion.
Dolly is a film term and applies to camera movement either toward or away from a subject (it also applies to horizontal ‚Äòtracking‚Äô movement as well, but is less relevant in a usability context).
Spatially in UX, this motion could refer either to a change in the viewers perspective, or to the perspective remaining static while the object changes position. The Dolly Principle supports usability through continuity and narrative, seamlessly transitioning between interface objects and destinations. Dolly can also incorporate the Dimensionality Principle, resulting in a more spatial experience, more depth, and communicating to the user additional areas or content that is ‚Äòin front‚Äô or ‚Äòbehind‚Äô the current view.
Zoom refers to events where neither the perspective nor the object is moving spatially, but rather the object itself is scaling (or our view of it is decreasing, resulting in the image enlarging). This communicates to the viewer that additional interface objects are ‚Äòinside‚Äô other objects or scenes.
This allows for seamless transitions ‚Äî both realtime and non-realtime ‚Äî that support usability. This seamlessness employed in the Dolly & Zoom Principle is quite powerful when it comes to creating spatial mental models.

Jeff Davidson|33K|8|https://blog.prototypr.io/the-most-important-rule-in-ux-design-that-everyone-breaks-1c1cb188931?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|The Most Important Rule in UX Design that Everyone Breaks|"There is one principle of organization that every human should adhere to, particularly people who design products. Day after day, I see companies break this rule, and it is 100% of the time to their detriment. In this article I will explain what that rule is, and what it means to product and service design. I‚Äôll also raise the possible implications of this phenomenon on organizational management, collaboration, and general performance. The psychological phenomenon I will be discussing in this article is known as Miller‚Äôs Law. Rather than just tell you what Miller‚Äôs Law is, I ask you to take part in this exercise for a more immersive learning lesson.
Read the italicized instructions before starting. Grab a pen and paper. This is an exercise where you will try to recall words you‚Äôve just read, off memory.
Below is a list of 20 words. Read them to comprehension , and try to memorize as many as possible. Try to keep the words ‚Äòin your head‚Äô. Do not write the words. Spend about a minute. After you are done reading, scroll down until you see the word ‚ÄòSTOP‚Äô. Then, read step 2.
STOP < ¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑
Now, use your pen and paper to write down as many words as you can remember from the list. Think hard, but do not scroll back up to view the words. If you scroll up, the experiment is ruined. Give yourself about half a minute...Once you have finished writing the words you tried to recall, scroll back up and check how many you got right.
If you are like the vast majority of human beings, you will have remembered 5‚Äì9 of the words. Hundreds of experiments prove universality of this limitation on memory. When I first discovered this phenomenon, I knew it had huge implications on product design, because of the degree to which this limitation affects day to day tasks. This capacity for keeping ~7 bits of information ‚Äòin the head‚Äô short term, is known as Miller‚Äôs Law.
In 1956 there was a paper written that became one of the most highly cited papers in psychology. Titled, The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information, it was published in 1956 by the cognitive psychologist George A. Miller of Princeton University‚Äôs Department of Psychology in Psychological Review. The crux of the paper suggests that the number of perceptual ‚Äòchunks‚Äô an average human can hold in working memory (a component of short-term memory) is 7 ¬± 2. This is frequently referred to as Miller‚Äôs law. Here is a summary of the article, sourced from wikipedia:
Moreover, the human mind can remember ~7 bits of information when completing a task that requires cognitive effort. This is critical, because humans are constantly performing tasks, and trying to juggle various stimuli in the mind when doing so. One of the key concepts behind Miller‚Äôs Law is ‚Äòchunking‚Äô, which basically means assembling various bits of information into a cohesive gestalt. For example, the word ¬∑ p e n c i l ¬∑ is actually a ‚Äòchunk‚Äô of letters, organized into a perceptual gestalt. If the letters were rearranged ¬∑ c n l i p e ¬∑ it would be six separate chunks of information. Chunking is a critical element of information organization, and is the basis for our UX and organizational rule.
Always organize elements of information in categories no larger than 9, but preferably ~5 chunks.
The more chunks of information you add to an ‚Äòinterface‚Äô, the more difficult it becomes to ‚Äòwork‚Äô, using the information at hand. This is especially critical for first time users, because they haven‚Äôt had the ‚Äòpractice‚Äô needed to encode the interface into long term memory, or, for the behaviour to become habitual. I constantly see this rule being broken by giants like Facebook, Google, and Wordpress. Don‚Äôt even get me started on automobile interface design. The ~5 bit chunk rule also compliments minimalism as a rigorous design philosophy. To expound, due to the limitations of working memory, as a product becomes more feature-full it inevitably becomes more difficult to use, because the user has to manage more information while operating the product. This makes good information design so critical.
Millers Law also highlights the importance of foresight and proper planning in the design process, because as you add more features to a product ‚Äî your interface must be able to accommodate those new features without breaking the visual foundation of what you built. Rebuilding a foundation takes immense time and resources.
Another perceptual phenomenon observed in relation to Miller‚Äôs Law is known as the primacy, and recency effect. These terms are used respectively to describe how we remember items sensed at the beginning and end of an experience, more than ones in the middle. For example, if I were to show you a list of words, you would more likely remember the words at the beginning of the list, and the end. This is also known as the serial position effect. From wikipedia:
This observation raises huge questions in business and design. If people remember more at the beginning and end of an experience, how do we enhance the positives, and mitigate the negatives at these respective times? When does an experience truly begin and end? Should we be organizing more important elements at the beginning and end of lists due to their increased retention? These are all valid questions that UX designers and executives should ask when inventing or developing their product.
Millers Law can be applied to any aspect of your life that involves performing a mildly complex task. By reducing the amount of elements in your reach/access ‚Äî and keeping them organized by relevant chunks not exceeding 9 bits, your brain will be able to remember exactly where things are so you can access its functionality. When lists of items grow too large, they become very difficult to mentally map them, requiring the user to do more cumbersome searching.
The adherence to Miller‚Äôs Law is especially relevant in the light of lean methodologies and recent trends in tech and UX. Users want and need a trial before they purchase something ‚Äî it‚Äôs that simple. If they don‚Äôt experience the value within the first day or week of using it ‚Äî they won‚Äôt buy. Since new users do not have lengthly time to learn where everything is ‚Äî information design needs to be planned and well thought out before development happens.
We live in a world with an exponentially increasing amount of information. By not organizing it properly, or eliminating some completely, it ultimately degrades our ability to complete critical tasks for the purposes of survival (navigation/gaining income). That is why it‚Äôs so useful to omit items, products, and services from your life that aren‚Äôt giving a quality return on investment. This falls in line with the Pareto principle, the idea that 80% of your outcomes comes from 20% of your investments. Are you juggling too many tasks per day to be efficient? Is your team using too many tools to collaborate? Do you have too many members on your team? Are you overloading your new employees with information, leading to confusion?
Millers law teaches us that humans have a finite amount of information they can process, and that information overload will lead to distraction that negatively affects performance. Companies should look for ways to organize information in a way that is much more digestible for their customers and employees. This could be by eliminating tools or applications that are producing cognitive overload, reducing the amount of members on a team, or even organizing your departments based on our knowledge of working memory.
This is especially true in new science of the concept of flow, made famous by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is a word Mihaly coined to describe a state of concentration or ‚Äòabsorption‚Äô with a specific task that humans ultimately find rewarding, pleasurable, and fulfilling. He describes it as an optimal state where we perform at our best and truly live ‚Äòin the moment‚Äô. One sure way to kill flow is by increasing distractions in the workplace. So, do you think that by giving your employees more tools, that it actually enhances performance? Miller‚Äôs Law teaches us time and time again this is not the case. When it comes to completing tasks, less is more.

John Cutler|18.2K|4|https://hackernoon.com/why-isnt-agile-working-d7127af1c552?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|Why Isn‚Äôt Agile Working? ‚Äì Hacker Noon|"I was visiting a relative a couple years ago. My poor cousin (the CEO of an insurance company) had been sold the Agile Silver Bullet TM and was pissed. He said something like:
I forget how I responded, but I know how I‚Äôd respond today. I‚Äôd draw some pictures and not even mention the word Agile. There are a couple core concepts I‚Äôd need to communicate to him....
First, if we look at lead time ‚Äî the time from when we dream up an idea, until it reaches customers ‚Äî you‚Äôll notice that most of the time is spent ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù. 15% flow efficiency (work time / lead time) is normal. Crazy, right? Yet we focus on what‚Äôs (relatively) visible...the small amount of time spent actually doing the job. The best companies hit 40%. Short story, to go faster, you need to address the waiting time.
It is not uncommon to have teams paying 75% ‚Äúinterest‚Äù on a combination of unplanned work and task switching. The team may not even be paying down the principle. It‚Äôs literally overhead, and often never tracked in the ticketing system. Most likely, the team complains about this (it is a terribly uninspiring situation). But ignored long enough, they accept the dismal reality.
Now imagine if this is a ‚Äúshared service‚Äù, and the team is responsible for addressing production issues, or provisioning new infrastructure while simultaneously doing ‚Äúprojects‚Äù. Suddenly you have a bottleneck.
Lesson: Address sources of unplanned work, and quantify the economic impact of having a shared service. Shared services make intuitive sense, but they often inspire a good deal of expensive pre-planning.
This is a fun trick. Plot the time-to-completion for your large, medium, and small work items. Try to move up a level and focus on items of actual customer value (not tasks). What you‚Äôll notice in many organizations is that the ‚Äúsize‚Äù of the work has no bearing on the time-to-completion. Why? There are too many other factors influencing how long it takes to complete the work (e.g. dependencies, unplanned work, lots of work in progress, etc.)
So much effort is spent reducing what I call ‚Äúdelivery risk‚Äù. This makes sense if you deliver custom projects and the customer pays cash-on-delivery. In SaaS (software as a service), we don‚Äôt get paid when we deliver the work. The benefits accrue over time. I call this ‚Äúbenefits risk‚Äù (the risk the work will be a dud).
It is common for big orgs to adopt Agile, but see no financial benefits. Why? Development is faster, but that has no bearing on 1) making the right product decisions, and 2) working to realize benefits. The whole POINT of Agile is to reduce risk. In project work, that risk is ‚Äúon time / within scope‚Äù. In product work, that risk is ‚Äúthis thing doesn‚Äôt ****ing work‚Äù. This is the whole fallacy of the PO ‚Äúaccepting‚Äù delivery of a feature. No benefit have been delivered!
Lots of companies adopt the model on the left. Few adopt the model on the right. When they get shitty results, they try to cram more work into the system which brings about a world of hurt.
And finally. Take a well understood reference feature and pass it through your product development system. Without managing complexity / refactoring / automation, it will take longer to complete this feature each year. Even if your team remains the exact same. Having something go from 3 days to 6 weeks is not unheard of.
Which brings me to Agile. Agile is worthless unless it serves as a catalyst for continuous improvement. Scrum and SAFe are worthless unless they serve as a catalyst for continuous improvement. Why? Because the factors that are slowing you down, are only partially due to whether you are sprinting, writing user stories, and doing biweekly demos. I‚Äôd argue those things are relatively minor (once you wrap your head around the idea of incrementally lowering risk).
To ‚Äúbe Agile‚Äù, you‚Äôll need to spend a good deal of money and energy on:
There‚Äôs no silver bullet. You have to do the work. Beware of anyone who says otherwise.

Jonathan Z. White|19.6K|6|https://medium.freecodecamp.org/before-you-can-master-design-you-must-first-master-the-fundamentals-1981a2af1fda?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|Before you can master design, you must first master the fundamentals|"Last week, one of my readers sent in a question: How do I become a better visual designer?
As I was thinking about how to answer this question, my mind wandered to my experience with learning Mandarin Chinese. Recently, I decided to teach myself Mandarin. When it comes to learning a new language, you first have to start with the fundamentals. Nouns, pronouns, and verbs form the basis for conveying more complex ideas.
Language is a way that people communicate concepts to one another. Visual design is a visual language. And learning visual design is no different from learning a new language.
Good visual designs aren‚Äôt born. They are made. The key to becoming a better visual designer is rigor. You will only improve as a visual designer if you make a conscious effort.
Here are some fundamentals you should master so you can take your visual design to the next level.
You can tell a lot about a designer by looking at their typography. This is because type is a fundamental basis for design.
You can create entire designs with just type. You can also base designs on type, taking subtle queues from the fonts that you choose. In order to improve the typography in your designs, first start by learning the basics.
Develop a vocabulary for describing type. Learn about what terms like tracking, kerning, and leading mean. The article A Beautifully Illustrated Glossary Of Typographic Terms You Should Know is a great visual resource for learning those terms.
Then, if you want a comprehensive understanding of how to apply typography to the web, read Web Typography: The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web.
Finally, learn how to pair fonts together. A great resource for this is FontWolf and FontPair. Being able to pair fonts together will dramatically change the dynamics of your design.
For a more in depth exploration of typography, you can read my article: Typography can make your design... Or break it.
Spacing helps establish vertical and horizontal motion in your designs. It‚Äôs pivotal for creating visual hierarchy and forming association between elements.
You can always look at sites like Behance and Dribbble for inspiration on how to space elements. But it‚Äôs important to develop your own intuition for using space to create balance and visual harmony.
When studying typography, you may have noticed the importance of spacing in type. Adjusting the kerning and leading for fonts is a great exercise for developing your eye for spacing. For this reason, I recommend you try KernType, a game where you compare your kerning solution to a typographer‚Äôs solution.
Another exercise that will help develop your eye is the following: Take an existing design, draw an x and y axis, simplify the design into basic shapes, analyze how the design is balanced, and then rearrange the elements. Pay close attention to how negative space affects the balance of the elements.
When it comes to creating visual hierarchy, sizing is second to none. By using size to convey visual relationships between elements, you can establish flow.
Sizing is one of the reasons why grids are useful. You can use grids to help you size elements using ratios to convey importance.
Once you have determined a size for an element, keep it the same across all instances of it. In design, consistency is king.
The key is asking for feedback.
Sketch or wireframe a landing page. Then ask a friend to look at your design. Get them to circle the elements that stand out the most. Afterwards, have them number the circled elements based on visual weight. Are the results what you expected?
When doing this exercise, keep the following questions in mind:
Color plays many roles. It conveys meaning, creates emotional resonance, and brings unity to designs.
For a deep dive into color, you can read my article Designing in Color. Here are a few key points from the article.
Once you have a good grasp on the basics of color theory, color comes down to experimentation and iteration. Actively try break out of your comfort zone and try new color palettes.
Spend time compiling color palettes for things around you like photographs, magazines, and your favorite shows. Then take an existing design and apply new color palettes to it.
Take note of how it changes the mood and tone of the design. Does it change the meaning as well?
Treat your work as a craft, in that there is always something that you can improve. Rely on yourself to be the motivation to become a better designer.
What are you strategies for improving as a designer? Leave me a note or send me a tweet on Twitter.

Nick Butcher|5K|6|https://medium.com/google-design/designing-adaptive-icons-515af294c783?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|Designing Adaptive Icons ‚Äì Google Design ‚Äì Medium|"Android O introduces a new app icon format: adaptive icons. Adaptive icons can make devices more coherent by unifying the shape of all app icons and opening the door to interesting visual effects. This post explains how they work and explores some techniques for designing them.
For a look back at where this feature has come from, see:
Adaptive icons are 108dp*108dp in size but are masked to a maximum of 72dp*72dp. Different devices can supply different masks which must be convex in shape and may reach a minimum of 33dp from the center in places.
Because of the minimum reach of the mask, you can consider a centered 66dp diameter circle as a safe zone, guaranteed not to be clipped.
Keyline shapes are the foundation of the icon grid helping your icon‚Äôs visual proportions be consistent with other apps‚Äô icons . The keyline shapes are:
See the templates included at the end of this article.
Adaptive icons are actually made up of two layers; a foreground and a background. Both layers are 108dp*108dp; the background must be fully opaque while the foreground may include transparency. These layers are stacked on top of each other.
Providing elements in two separate layers which are larger than the displayed (i.e. masked) size creates the opportunity for interesting visual treatments and animations. Exactly what effects may be applied and when is still something of an open question; it is up to device and launcher makers to decide. Here are some simple examples you could imagine: parallax or pulsing by independently translating or scaling each layer before applying the mask.
As the 108dp*108dp icons are masked up to 72dp*72dp, the outer 18dp on each side can be considered the ‚Äúextra‚Äù content, only revealed during motion.
The material design guidelines for creating product icons still very much apply. Specifically the icon anatomy, shadows and finish remain, but you can now place elements in either the foreground or background layers yielding different effects.
Now I‚Äôm sure that many icons will be well served by placing their brand mark in the foreground on a solid colored background and calling it a day. This will ensure that your icon fits in well on the device. What excites me is how we as a community will explore these new constraints and find interesting, playful and innovative ways to make delightful icons. Here are a few things to keep in mind and a few ideas to potentially explore.
Due to the dynamic nature of adaptive icons, you cannot know the exact mask shape that will be applied. For that reason it‚Äôs best to place any critical elements like your brand mark inside the safe-zone and to stay away from the mask edges.
Placing some elements which might appear to be foreground, actually in the background means that they will move independently. For example the calculator app places most elements in the foreground, but the equals button on the accent color block in the background:
This creates interesting opportunities for motion where you visually anchor on the bright color block, but it moves less than the foreground elements, creating a sensation of depth.
I think that there may be interesting opportunities for placing masking elements in the foreground ‚Äî that is solid elements with areas cut out. Consider a possible icon for the Google Play Store, this might be constructed in an ‚Äòobvious‚Äô manner, that is placing the colored triangle in the foreground atop a white background.
Instead of doing this, we might use a colorful background and a white foreground with the triangle subtracted to produce the same static output:
This setup would allow the colors ‚Äòpeeking through‚Äô to move independently of the mask revealing different parts of the background when translated or scaled.
The interaction of lighting effects and shadows placed in separate layers can have interesting results. For example using the long-shadow technique on the foreground element can have a playful interaction as it moves within the masked area. Similarly lighting effects can be placed in the foreground layer rather than being baked into the background. For example, a ‚Äòfinish‚Äô layer can be placed in the foreground to emulate a light source. Placing this in the foreground means that it will play over the background layer when under motion, moving at a different rate to it.
Be careful not to create an effect that doesn‚Äôt make sense e.g. a shadow detaching from a foreground element or moving behind a background element. Also remember that many icons are likely to be seen together so be conservative with bespoke lighting effects and stick close to the material guidelines.
You could place elements in the background layer which are completely obscured by the foreground layer and only revealed under motion.
Here is my sketch file which you can use as a template whilst creating adaptive icons. It includes the icon grid, keyline shapes and safe area. It‚Äôs implemented as a symbol so changing the master element will update the copies giving you a preview with different masks applied.
I‚Äôve also uploaded an Adobe Illustrator template if that‚Äôs more your thing.
Additionally check out these other resources i‚Äôve come across:
In developing adaptive icons, I‚Äôve come to appreciate that many of the subtleties come from the interaction of the foreground and background elements when motion effects are applied. This is still something of an open question as we are yet to see how device and launcher makers will implement this. To help investigate this space, I‚Äôve created a small test app to help you evaluate it whilst creating your icon:
The app displays all applications installed on your device with adaptive icons. Scrolling the grid applies parallax effects to the icons and touching an icon applies a scale effect. You can configure the strength of the effects and change the mask applied to all icons. Hopefully this tool helps you to envisage how your icon will appear and may move on different devices.
You can download an APK or checkout the source on github:
Hopefully this post has given you both the information and some inspiration to design an awesome adaptive icon for your app. As a user, I cannot wait for my apps to become more coherent. What excites me even more though, is seeing what creative solutions we come up with as a community.
If you‚Äôre a developer looking to build an adaptive icon, then join me in part 3: Implementing adaptive icons.

Adhithya|3.4K|8|https://uxdesign.cc/designing-better-tables-for-enterprise-applications-f9ef545e9fbd?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|Designing better tables for enterprise applications|"Enterprise applications are complex ‚Äî there is an insane amount of information that is to be displayed that contains data from various sources, modules and users. There are complex graphs, usage patterns, and lists of data that need to be skimmed through before one can make sense of what the console is getting at.
Since most enterprise applications contain sensitive data pertaining to the company, there are very few examples out there that talk to some of the common problems faced while designing enterprise apps. There exists pattern libraries that talk in-depth about how each component should work but very little on when to use them. The patterns we see in design libraries are often oversimplified and does not work in real enterprise applications where data and the use-cases are more complex in nature.
What you see below is a typical enterprise application. The working window is dense with information with a crazy number of panels each indicating information that is contextual to any other selection made on the screen.
As you can notice above, the most space consuming section of the application is a table. Tables This article will help designers who are trying to figure out how to use table patterns the right way depending on specific scenarios.
A pattern of the past in most consumer facing applications but very much an effective and widely used one in the enterprise world. There is no better way, yet, to display huge lists of data in any other way but on tables. Tables are effective because the nature of enterprise applications requires users to view rows of data simultaneously, scanning through alerts, comparing data and looking at data in any specific order of the user‚Äôs choice.
What you are seeing below might seem like a very regular table pattern and might seem like there is nothing wrong about the usability of it at first, but as you get deeper into working on it, one would start realizing the quirks of operating it.
In the first example here, the links on the first column probably hints at the fact that clicking it will take you to the user‚Äôs profile. Not very clear, but not very hard to guess either.
But on the other hand, what happens on clicking on the link in the example below?
Above is a real example from an enterprise application, where clicking the link copies the code to the clipboard. This action was not very easy to understand and such ambiguous patterns should be avoided.
Performing actions such as delete, move, print, export etc are very common, especially when done for multiple items simultaneously. Most enterprise applications have actions present on each row, and sometimes it is necessary to have these as there is a need to perform the actions on specific rows. Having said that, most actions can be extrapolated from the row and be a different section on the page.
The proximity of action that needs to be performed on a row should not be furthest away from the identifying column. More often than not, this leads to an action being performed on the wrong row. This puts too much cognitive effort for a person to keep track of row and click the action without mistaking it for another row. This pattern is prone to error and should be avoided.
Here the action ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù is present on all the rows and seems repetitive on each row. Imagine the same row with five or six options that repeat itself ‚Äî this would make the table look visually very cluttered. Also, in such a table, it is impossible to delete multiple items at the same time as there is no way to select multiple items.
A good pattern followed to select and perform actions on multiple items on a table at the same time is allowing each row to be selected. Upon selection, a toolbar appears either right above or below the table where the actions to be performed can be placed.
This pattern is followed in most enterprise applications that has multiple list items in the form of a table. Some designers find the checkbox to be visually overwhelming as well because they are present on each row.
Google Inbox has a pattern that reveals the checkbox only on hovering over the leftmost part of the row as highlighted below. In addition, for power users there is an option to use shift and select multiple items at the same time. This is a very good example of implementing action patterns on a table.
Icon only actions are another commonly used pattern that makes the user think, and a rule of thumb for a good user experience is not to make them think. It cognitively loads the user to remember what each icons mean and where they are located.
The nature of enterprise application is usually such that tables that run multiple pages just due to the volume of data. Often times, designers wonder if users even paginate through multiple pages to view data or if they are viewing just what is present on the first page.
How can this be accomplished? Good filters and a robust search mechanism.
When a user paginates, they are looking for something specific. So before we get into designing good pagination, one must ask the question ‚Äî
One good proven solution is providing filters that are contextual in nature ‚Äî that is, based on the workflow of a user on the current screen, the filters present themselves with the options that could be most relevant to the current scenario.
When does search help?Just leaving this here..
Now that we know how to think about pagination, it is necessary nevertheless. One of my biggest pet-peeves with pagination is the presence of item limits in the following fashion ‚Äî
The user sees the first ten items on the list and has to paginate to view the eleventh one. Why can the table not programmatically find out if there are just one to three more items on the next page and display them all here? Or even better, no pagination if the items on the table are lesser than say 25? These are not difficult to implement, just that they have not been given much thought about.
A user selects the first three items on page, then the first four on the second page, logically when he hits delete all 7 should be deleted. That does not happen because it is technically challenging and costly to retain the information of user-selection when paginating across pages.
Selecting all items is another challenge when you have a table that paginates. It is only possible to either select all the items in the current view, or select all the items on the complete list.
Here, the user selects all the items on the page, then selects all 3000 odd items on the entire list. On paginating the selection is missing ‚Äî this is again a technical limitation of pagination where preserving the memory of selection is expensive from an engineering standpoint.
What about infinite scroll/ lazy loading? Many applications are moving away from pagination altogether for a Facebook/Twitter styled infinite feed. Designers have mixed thoughts about this, and to me personally, a ‚ÄúLoad More‚Äù button works best.
This loads only what fits in the current view, and if there is a conscious action from the user to load more, then more items are loaded.
This is by no-stretch an extensive list of suggestions for designing tables but a conglomeration of most commonly occurring problems and ways to solve them. I‚Äôd love to hear from you if you have items that could be added to this list.
There are some excellent UI suggestions by Andrew Coyle on designing better data tables. I‚Äôd highly recommend reading it for good interaction practices on tables.

Naema Baskanderi|2.5K|6|https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows|"Modals, Overlays, Dialogs, whatever you call them it‚Äôs time to revisit this UI pattern. When they first came on the scene, modal windows were an elegant solution to a UI problem. The first being that it simplifies the UI, the second, it saves screen real estate. Since then designers have readily adopted the modal window and some have taken it to the extreme. Modals have become the today‚Äôs version of the dreaded popup window. Users find modals annoying and have been trained to instinctively and automatically dismiss these windows.
A modal window is an element that sits on top of an application‚Äôs main window. It creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Users must interact with the modal window before they can return to the parent application. ‚Äî Wikipedia
You may consider using a modal window when you need to:
Use when you want to interrupt a user‚Äôs current task to catch the user‚Äôs full attention to something more important.
Use when you want to get information from the user. Ex. sign up or login form.
Use when you want to show additional information without losing the context of the parent page. Ex. showing larger images or videos.
Use when you want to show information that is not directly related to the parent page or other options that are ‚Äúindependent‚Äù from other pages. Ex. notifications.
Poorly implemented overlays can hinder task completion. To ensure your modal doesn‚Äôt get in the way make sure to include the following:
Give users a way to escape by giving them a way to close the modal. This can be achieved in the following ways:
Give context to the user with the modal title. This allows the user to know where he/she is because they haven‚Äôt left the original page.
Button labels should have actionable, understandable names. This applies to a button in any instance. For modals, a ‚Äòclose‚Äô button should be present in the form of a labeled ‚Äòclose‚Äô button or an ‚Äòx‚Äô.
A modal window should not be too big or too small, you want it juuuuust right. The goal is to keep context, therefore a modal should not take up the whole screen view. Content should fit the modal. If a scrollbar is needed, you may consider creating a new page instead.
When you open a modal use a lightbox effect (darken the background). This draws attention to the modal and indicates that the user cannot interact with the parent page.
Don‚Äôt surprise users by popping up a modal. Let a user‚Äôs action, such as a button click, following a link or selecting an option, trigger the modal. Uninvited modals may surprise the user and result in a quick dismissal of the window.
Modals and mobile devices usually don‚Äôt play well together. Viewing the content is difficult because modals either are too large, taking up too much screen space or too small. Add in elements like the device keyboard and nested scrollbars; users are left pinching and zooming trying to catch the fields of a modal window. There are better alternatives for modals and shouldn‚Äôt be used on mobile devices.
When creating modals remember to add in keyboard accessibility. Consider the following:
Opening modal ‚Äî The element which triggers the dialog must be keyboard accessible
Moving focus into the Dialog ‚Äî Once the modal window is open, the keyboard focus needs to be moved to the top of that
Managing Keyboard Focus ‚Äî Once the focus is moved into the dialog, it should be ‚Äútrapped‚Äù inside it until the dialog is closed.
Closing the Dialog ‚Äî Each overlay window must have a keyboard accessible control to close that window.
For more information on the list above check out Nomensa‚Äôs blog article
Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) defines ways to make Web content and Web applications more accessible.
The following ARIA tags can be helpful in creating an accessible modal: Role = ‚Äúdialog‚Äù , aria-hidden, aria-label
for more information on ARIA, check out Smashing‚Äôs Magazine article
Also, remember low-vision users. They may use screen magnifiers on monitors to enlarge the screen content. Once zoomed in the user can only see part of the screen. Here modals will have the same effect as they do in mobile.
Getting the user‚Äôs attention, keeping context and simplifying the UI are great benefits of modals. However, there are downsides as they interrupt the user flow and make it impossible to interact with the parent page by hiding the content behind the modal. Modal may not always be the answer. Consider the following when making your choice:

Ferdinand Vogler|19K|4|https://medium.com/@fvo/your-logo-is-copied-710ac4604258?source=tag_archive---------7---------------------|Your logo is copied ‚Äì Ferdinand Vogler ‚Äì Medium|"‚ÄúWait, I‚Äôve seen this logo before. Why does it seem so familiar to me?‚Äù
After a few years in Design you eventually find out that everything has been done before. I figured out where some popular logos might have come from. When does copying become stealing? Is it even that bad?
Design solves problems while adding uniqueness to the end result. That is called creativity. We are bombarded with visual messages all day. Maybe you saw a great design featured on some blog. A few months later you come up with something similar. You might just not remember why you came up with such a solution. When creating, we are recycling impressions all the time without realizing it.
Some websites like calling out brands for ripping-off or stealing a design. In many cases there is no differentiation between stealing and copying. I‚Äôd like to state how I distinguish between these two terms.
Stealing means replicating a design end-to-end. The company wants to profit from the attributes the design communicates. Stealing is sewing a Nike logo on sweaters to sell them for double the price. Design is an approach that is tailored to each instance it is applied, thereby making it hard to imitate. Stealing often involves a discrepancy between communicated message and content. Self-image and public image are not congruent. Thats why premium brands can‚Äôt be imitated easily. Stealing is an insidious attempt at not being discovered.
Copying is different. It‚Äôs the way we learn. Think about how babies grow-up and learn new skills: they imitate their parents. Thousands of years ago some iconic Roman sculptures were created by casting exact copies of Greek statues. By copying we are acknowlodging the past and building upon existing knowledge. I taught myself how to program by copying code from other websites and playing around with it. Copying means being influenced by an idea and applying it in a different form and context. It pays tribute to the originator and always challenges the appropriate use for itself.
Take the concept of Flat Design. It‚Äôs a style that Googles Material Design leveraged, but they didn‚Äôt come up with it. It‚Äôs difficult to find out who started something. Even if you do find the originator, how do you know they weren‚Äôt influenced by something they weren‚Äôt aware of? Maybe they‚Äôre only hiding their source? As you see, we‚Äôre quickly getting into a chicken-egg-debate here.
Semantics make the world better navigable for us. We take commonly understood pictograms and alter them to a brand language. Semantics mean you recognize a symbol of which you have learnt the meaning. Think about the fire exit sign, the hamburger icon or the power switch symbol. By embracing this we make our work usable for a wide variety of people. No one would call this stealing. Still, it is copying.
While reflecting on this I changed the way I used the words copying and stealing. Copying offers opportunity to learn while stealing avoids the hard work. Stealing implicits that all Design challenges deserve the same solution. We don‚Äôt have to act like we‚Äôre reinventing the wheel every time‚Äî even if we might sell it that way sometimes. There are a lot of replicable parts in Design. You must listen and still strive for originality, otherwise you will end up with dissatisfied clients, a bad reputation and zero personal growth.
Have you ever caught yourself copying an idea? Were you the one that was stolen from? How did you deal with that? Is anything original anymore? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on this.

‚Äî So... We have designed a first version of our app, but we‚Äôre now thinking of doing the UX to improve a few things... People are downloading the app, using it once, but not really coming back to it over time.
What they meant: can you help us think through the app‚Äôs interaction design, structure and navigation?
Where the misconception is: presuming one single person is responsible for successfully conceiving, designing, implementing and validating the user‚Äôs experience with a product.
A good user experience depends on:
What they meant: I love the interface you designed.
Where the misconception is: UX is an abstract noun, not concrete.
What they meant: this user interface is hard to use.
Where the misconception is: that good UX = good usability.
UX stands for User Experience. A user‚Äôs experience with your product can be good or bad (in the example above, probably bad). UX Designers are not magic creatures holding a wand that simply ‚Äúadds‚Äù UX to an interface. The UX was already there ‚Äî it was just making the user‚Äôs life miserable.
What they meant: iougarklasjbsdfgaiweoqiuwyrshbe.
Where the problem is: in the world.
What they meant: learn a few best practices that will help you make less mistakes when designing app interfaces that will live on Android-powered devices.
Where the misconception is: thinking that every single Android app experience is the same, and that there are a series of universal laws that work for any Android app ‚Äî from a game to an ecommerce app, including dating apps and maps.
It‚Äôs like creating a course for architects called ‚Äúlearn how to design lofts‚Äù. No matter whether it is a 300 or 3000 square-foot one. Whether it is residential or a storage area. Whether it is for a single person, or for a family of eight. Whether it is built in a Rio favela or on an Icelandic plateau. Whether it will be made of clay or steel. ‚ÄúIn one weekend you will learn how to create lofts for any situation.‚Äù

Jonny Gibson|11.9K|5|https://medium.com/black-lion-banner/the-history-of-the-ampersand-c81839171940?source=tag_archive---------9---------------------|The History of the Ampersand ‚Äì Black Lion Banner ‚Äì Medium|"These days everybody knows about the ampersand. It‚Äôs one of typography‚Äôs most unique and interesting characters.
Its rise to hipster fame has catapulted the ampersand from the sketchbooks of type designers onto just about every printable surface you can imagine, the variations of which seem endless. From traditional representations all the way to hyper-stylised forms that bear little resemblance to the original mark.
The varied nature of its form allows type designers a little creative freedom, and is often seen as an opportunity to inject some extra personality into a typeface. Officially classified as punctuation by today‚Äôs unicode, it was in fact, once the 27th letter in the English alphabet existing as the graphical representation of the word ‚Äòand‚Äô.
Designers in all fields both love and hate the ampersand in equal measure, but very few know much about its history, or intended use, which is actually rather interesting.
As with a lot of aspects of typography, the history of the ampersand begins with our triumphant and progressive friends, the Ancient Romans.
Roman scribes would write in cursive so as to increase the speed of their transcription, often combining letters into one form to save time while also increasing legibility, where certain characters overlap in a visually discordant manner ‚Äî this was the birth of the ligature. The ampersand is simply a ligature of the letters E and T (et being the latin word for and).
As the Romans expanded their empire across the globe, many languages just absorbed this ligature into their own alphabet. However as these languages evolved, the connection between the original ligature and the word it now represents diminished beyond comprehension. The outcome was a rise in overly stylised versions, much less representative of its original form.
In some of the traditional style typefaces of the modern age, the ampersand is more clearly representative of the original et ligature. Caslon is a great example of this, with many italic typeface variants also following suit.
In contrast, many modern handwriting fonts use a variation of E and T such as the examples below.
While this helps explain why this character exists, and why it looks the way it does, it doesn‚Äôt really explain where it gets its name? Where on earth did the term ampersand actually come from?
Before deconstructing the word ampersand, you must first understand another latin legacy that made its way into our modern language.
By the early seventeen hundreds, schools throughout England had started to use the phrase per se (essentially meaning by itself) when spelling out words. This was specifically useful when encountering words that consist of only a single letter (A, I and originally O). As an example, in order to spell the phrase ‚ÄúI invite you‚Äù, children would say:
indicting that the initial i stood by itself, rather than a part of the proceeding word.
At the same time, and (the et-ligature &, now pronounced and) had become common place and was all but inducted into the English language as the 27th letter of the alphabet. It became so widely used that children in school, when reciting the alphabet, would include & after the letter Z. The result of this was that phonetically you would hear ‚ÄúX, Y, Z and per se and‚Äù indicating that the & stood by itself at the end of the alphabet. The phrase ‚Äúand per se and‚Äù was inevitably slurred into one single term and by 1837, the term ampersand was well and truly immortalised in the English dictionary.
Interesting fact ‚Äî The ampersand was the only letter in the English alphabet that did not represent a speech sound.
Over time, the ampersand would be de-classified within the English alphabet and its usage decreased as a result. While the & glyph still remains with its meaning unchanged, its use in modern english writing is somewhat frowned upon. It does however serve some interesting use cases adding a level of clarity where simply using and would not. For example:
An ampersand adds clarity when items within a list require and as part of its name, rather than as a separator (e.g. ‚Äútake your knife, pestle & mortar and ingredients‚Äù).
When giving credit to writers in the film, screenplay or story world, an & indicates collaboration of a closer nature than and. Writing ‚ÄòMcAndrew and Thorne‚Äô implies that Thorne was involved in re-writing some of McAndrews script. McAndrew & Thorne represents a dual effort where both writers collaborated to write the script together.
Many educational institutions require the use of an & when citing sources of original work (e.g. ‚ÄòGibson & Fellwinter, 1986‚Äô)
So there you have it. The history of the worlds most famous character*.
You may find that, like me, you will never be able to look at an & in the same way again. This is both a blessing and a curse. However, as with all cycles of fashion and trend, we are beginning to see a resurgence of the original et-ligature, replacing the modern & form. As more type designers become aware of the history of this expressive little glyph, the desire to re-introduce it has grown. Keep your eyes peeled and spread your new found knowledge.

Maybe the company you work for doesn‚Äôt have a full-time designer and you need to implement the UI for a new feature on your own. Or maybe you‚Äôre hacking on a side-project and you want it to look better than yet-another-Bootstrap-site.
It‚Äôs easy to throw your hands up and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be able to make this look good, I‚Äôm not an artist!‚Äù but it turns out there are a ton of tricks you can use to level up your work that don‚Äôt require a background in graphic design.
Here are seven simple ideas you can use to improve your designs today.
A common mistake when styling UI text is relying too much on font size to control your hierarchy.
‚ÄúIs this text important? Let‚Äôs make it bigger.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs this text secondary? Let‚Äôs make it smaller.‚Äù
Instead of leaving all of the heavy lifting to font size alone, try using color or font weight to do the same job.
‚ÄúIs this text important? Let‚Äôs make it bolder.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs this text secondary? Let‚Äôs use a lighter color.‚Äù
Try and stick to two or three colors:
Similarly, two font weights is usually enough for UI work:
Stay away from font weights under 400 for UI work; they can work for large headings but are too hard to read at smaller sizes. If you‚Äôre considering using a lighter weight to de-emphasize some text, use a lighter color or smaller font size instead.
Making text a lighter grey is a great way to de-emphasize it on white backgrounds, but it doesn‚Äôt look so great on colored backgrounds.
That‚Äôs because the effect we‚Äôre actually seeing with grey on white is reduced contrast.
Making the text closer to the background color is what actually helps create hierarchy, not making it light grey.
There are two ways you can reduce contrast when working with colorful backgrounds:
Use white text and lower the opacity. This lets the background color bleed through a bit, de-emphasizing the text in a way that doesn‚Äôt clash with the background.
This works better than reducing the opacity when your background is an image or pattern, or when reducing the opacity makes the text feel too dull or washed out.
Choose a color that‚Äôs the same hue as the background, adjusting saturation and lightness until it looks right to you.
Instead of using large blur and spread values to make box shadows more noticeable, add a vertical offset.
It looks a lot more natural because it simulates a light source shining down from above like we‚Äôre used to seeing in the real world.
This applies to inset shadows like you might use on wells or form inputs too:
If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about shadow design, the Material Design Guidelines are a fantastic primer.
When you need to create separation between two elements, try to resist immediately reaching for a border.
While borders are a great way to distinguish two elements from one another, they aren‚Äôt the only way, and using too many of them can make your design feel busy and cluttered.
The next time you find yourself reaching for a border, try one of these ideas instead:
Box shadows do a great job of outlining an element like a border would, but can be more subtle and accomplish the same goal without being as distracting.
Giving adjacent elements slightly different background colors is usually all you need to create distinction between them. If you‚Äôre already using different background colors in addition to a border, try removing the border; you might not need it.
What better way to create separation between elements than to simply increase the separation? Spacing things further apart is a great way to create distinction between groups of elements without introducing any new UI at all.
If you‚Äôre designing something that could use some large icons (like maybe the ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù section of a landing page), you might instinctively grab a free icon set like Font Awesome or Zondicons and bump up the size until they fit your needs.
They‚Äôre vector images after all, so the quality isn‚Äôt going to suffer if you increase the size right?
While it‚Äôs true that vector images won‚Äôt degrade in quality when you increase their size, icons that were drawn at 16‚Äì24px are never going to look very professional when you blow them up to 3x or 4x their intended size. They lack detail, and always feel disproportionately ‚Äúchunky‚Äù.
If small icons are all you‚Äôve got, try enclosing them inside another shape and giving the shape a background color:
This lets you keep the actual icon closer to its intended size, while still filling the larger space.
If you have the budget, you could also use a premium icon set designed to be used at larger sizes, like Heroicons or Iconic.
If you‚Äôre not a graphic designer, how do you add that dash of visual flair to your UI that other designs get from beautiful photography or colorful illustrations?
One simple trick that can make a big difference is to add colorful accent borders to parts of your interface that would otherwise feel a bit bland.
For example, along the side of an alert message:
...or to highlight active navigation items:
...or even across the top of your entire layout:
It doesn‚Äôt take any graphic design talent to add a colored rectangle to your UI, and it can go a long way towards making your site feel more ‚Äúdesigned.‚Äù
Have a hard time picking colors? Try choosing from a constrained palette like Dribbble‚Äôs color search to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the endless possibilities of a traditional color picker.
When there are multiple actions a user can take on a page, it‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of designing those actions based purely on semantics.
Frameworks like Bootstrap sort of encourage this by giving you a menu of semantic styles to choose from whenever you‚Äôre adding a new button:
‚ÄúIs this a positive action? Make the button green.‚Äù
‚ÄúDoes this delete data? Make the button red.‚Äù
Semantics are an important part of button design, but there‚Äôs a more important dimension that‚Äôs commonly forgotten: hierarchy.
Every action on a page sits somewhere in a pyramid of importance. Most pages only have one true primary action, a couple of less important secondary actions, and a few seldom used tertiary actions.
When designing these actions, it‚Äôs important to communicate their place in the hierarchy.
‚ÄúWhat about destructive actions, shouldn‚Äôt they always be red?‚Äù
Not necessarily! If the destructive action isn‚Äôt the primary action on the page, it might be better to give it a secondary or tertiary button treatment.
Save the big, red, and bold styling for when that negative action actually is the primary action in the interface, like in a confirmation dialog:

The internet suffers from a lack of imagination, so I asked my students to redesign it
Photo by Pankaj Patel on Unsplash
Photo by Pankaj Patel on Unsplash
Today‚Äôs internet is bland. Everything looks the same: generic fonts, no layouts to speak of, interchangeable pages, and an absence of expressive visual language. Even micro-typography is a mess.
Web design today seems to be driven by technical and ideological constraints rather than creativity and ideas. Every page consists of containers in containers in containers; sometimes text, sometimes images. Nothing is truly designed, it‚Äôs simply assumed.
Ironically, today‚Äôs web technologies have enormous design capabilities. We have the capability to implement almost every conceivable idea and layout. We can create radical, surprising, and evocative websites. We can combine experimental typography with generative images and interactive experiences.
And yet, even websites for designers are based on containers in containers in containers. The most popular portals for creatives on the web ‚Äî Dribbble and Behance ‚Äî are so fundamentally boring they‚Äôre basically interchangeable. (See lead image.)
How did this happen?
There are a few reasons. Technological frameworks like Content Management Systems (CMS) and blogging platforms like WordPress are based on templates. Web pages on these frameworks are not individually crafted but generated on the fly by piecing together various media types like images, headlines, body text, and videos. Templates are not designs. Rather, they are rules for combining related data types. Beyond the template, these platforms typically offer users no way to influence a page‚Äôs visual appearance. What you see is what you poured into the template.
In other words, templates are content agnostic. And that is the problem.
One of the fundamental principles of design is a deep and meaningful connection between form and content; form should both reflect and shape content. Separating them breaks this principle and creates generic content containers. In a design sense, templates are meaningless; the form adds nothing to the content.
There are plenty of other reasons for web design‚Äôs lack of creativity. Most of them are economic and pragmatic. For example, it‚Äôs time-consuming to design individual pages. Considering the speed of online news and the frequency of new articles, large websites simply do not have the resources to design a page from the ground up. Furthermore, web design is still a matter of technical expertise: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS remain challenging tools for designers. There‚Äôs no web design equivalent to the direct and obliging workflows of desktop publishing applications.
I suspect designers‚Äô creative and intellectual laziness is to blame, too. In the age of mobile-first, generic, framework-driven development, nobody seems to bother with the visual and contextual integrity of a web page.
How can we tackle this challenge? What can expressive and avant-garde websites look like today?
Sometimes, if you want to design the future, you have to rediscover the past.
I designed my first website about 23 years ago at the research and development group at the University of the Arts in Bremen, Germany. Creating web pages was hot at the time. The web was young. Pages sparked my imagination.
In the mid-nineties, we were struggling with the constraints of HTML. We could only use web-safe fonts like Arial, Times, or Verdana. We had to use table layouts, monospaced fonts, or GIFs if we wanted to do anything exciting. HTML was purely content-driven initially, and we had to work against the technology in order to design a page.
At the same time, experimental typography was exploding. From Jan Tschichold‚Äôs Die Neue Typographie in the twenties to the computer-driven layouts by April Greiman in the eighties, designers challenged the status quo and tried to find a visual language that represented the ideas and revolutions of their eras. By the mid-nineties, an unusual combination of technological and cultural advancements allowed for a very radical breed of graphic design. You could see it in the work of Irma Boom, David Carson, Paula Scher, Neville Brody, and many others.
Compared to the visual explosion of the graphic design world, however, early web pages were still fairly lame. (The Web Design Museum documents this very well.)
We wanted to do graphic design in the browser, but nobody knew how ‚Äî or what mistakes could be made. There were no expectations of how a web page should look. There were no standards. No CMS (almost), no CSS, no JS, no video, no animation.
Fast forward to 2018, and we can do everything in a browser. From massive-scale layouts to micro-typography, animation, and video. And what do we do with these incredible possibilities? Containers in containers in containers. Gigabytes of visually bland mobile-first pages contaminated with JavaScript. Generic templates that follow the same visual rules. If my younger self could have seen the state of web design 23 years later, he would have been very disappointed.
Web design‚Äôs problem is not the limits of technology but the limits of our imagination. We‚Äôve become far too obedient to visual conformity, economic viability, and assumed expectations.
However, every crisis creates an opportunity. Now is as good a time as any to challenge the internet‚Äôs visual conformity. Alas, I am too old and too bourgeois to come up with a radical, experimental, and state-of-the-art approach to web design. But I can ask my students to do it.
In 2017, I gave a web design class at the Interface Design Programme in Potsdam, Germany. Each team was asked to come up with a redesign for an existing website. The assignment was very clear: Treat the browser as a blank canvas and create expressive, imaginative visual experiences. Use the technological potential of current web technologies as a channel for your creativity. Do not be constrained by questions of usability, legibility, and flexibility. Have an attitude. Disregard ErwartungskonformitaÃàt.
I was very happy with the outcome of the class. (You can see all the results on this overview page.) Here are four projects that represent different approaches to the challenge.
Frederic and Jonas chose the web site of the Zentrum fuÃàr Kunst und Medien (ZKM) as a starting point for their experiments and explorations. A very fitting choice as the ZKM is one of the most prominent exhibition spaces for media art in Germany but ZKM‚Äôs website is fairly conventional. It‚Äôs functional but it lacks the avant-garde assertion that is conveyed by artwork in the exhibitions.
Frederic and Jonas‚Äôs aim was to design a concept, a visual language, and a technical setup for the ZKM site that represents the museum‚Äôs progressive approach. At the core of their concept is a generative design engine: Every time a page loads, a new layout is created.
View the redesign of the ZKM.
Streem is an art and street magazine. It is both a stage for upcoming artists and a platform for social issues. Streem includes work from illustration, painting, photography, design, writing, and journalism. Daria, Bela, and Lucas combined these different influences and based their designs on a conceptual city structure. For their prototype, they created four different neighborhoods that each represent a section of the magazine. Their approach combines strong illustrative styles with spatial typography in order to create a legible city.
View the redesign of Streem.
Amelie and Fabian took a very structural approach. Instead of finding an adequate form for a specific story, their aim was to dissolve a web page and break it down to semantic, syntactical, and statistical properties. Their idea was to demonstrate the fluidity and inherent malleability of HTML. They deconstructed Medium posts and created an environment that allows readers to break long blocks of text into experimental typographic space.
View the redesign of Medium.
Fabian and Florian turned Hacker News into an interactive visualization. The social media site is a news aggregator, focusing on computer science and information technology. Its design is bare-bones but it has complex functionality for voting and discussions. Fabian and Florian have taken the existing structure and turned it into a typographic space of timelines and networks. The visual presentation is based on the sequence and connections of news and comments. They also connected their design to the API of Hacker News, so you can actually use it to read the site. View the redesign of Hacker News.
David Carson once said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt confuse communication with legibility.‚Äù We should apply this advice to the current state of web design. Legibility, usability, responsiveness, and especially accessibility are essential qualities of the modern web. But they should not define and limit its visual repertoire. If you equate stereotypes with usability, you have understood neither visual design nor human-centered design.
I, for one, would like to see more radical, generative, evocative, thoughtful, adequate, content-specific, and intelligent web design. I would like to rediscover the web as a space for design experiments. I would like to be surprised more often. I don‚Äôt know what the web will look in another 23 years, but I certainly hope it doesn‚Äôt look like the web today.

Eugen EsÃßanu|40K|9|https://uxplanet.org/10-small-design-mistakes-we-still-make-1cd5f60bc708?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|10 Small Design Mistakes We Still Make ‚Äì UX Planet|"The saying that ‚Äúgood design is obvious‚Äù is pretty damn old, and I am sure it took different shapes in the previous centuries. It referred to good food, music, architecture, clothes, philosophy and everything else.
We forget that human mind changes very slow, and the knowledge you have about human behaviour will not go old for at least 50 years or so. To make it easy for you, we need to keep consistent with a couple of principles that will remind us of how to design great products. We should be told at least once a month about these small principles until we live and breathe good design.
Steve Krug laid out some useful principles back in 2000, after the dot-com boom which are still valuable and relevant nowadays. Even after his revised version, nothing changed. Yes, you will tell me that the looks are more modern and the websites are more organised and advanced (no more flash!). But what I mean about that is ‚Äî nothing has changed in human behaviour. We will always want the principle ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make me think‚Äù applied to any type of product we interact (whether it is a microwave, tv, smartphone or car).
The reason for that is ‚Äî we are on a mission, and we only look for the thing that interests us. For example, I rarely remember myself going through all the text on the homepage of a product website. Why? Because most of the web users are trying to get something done, and done quickly. We do not have time to read more than necessary. And we still put a lot of text because we think people need to know that. Or as some designers say: ‚Äúit adds to the experience‚Äù.
Another important aspect that will help scanning a page is offering a proper visual hierarchy. We have to make it clear that the appearance on a page portrays the relationship between elements. So there are a couple of principles for that:
We believe that people want something new and more. But we forget that there are so many applications on the market that each demands our time. Each of them has different interactions, and we need to learn each one of them. And our mind blows up when: ‚ÄúOh man, another app to learn?!‚Äù.
We as designers, when asked to design something new, have a temptation to try and reinvent the wheel. Because doing something like everyone else seems somehow wrong. We have been hired to do something different. Not to mention that the industry rarely offers awards and praises for designing something that has ‚Äúthe best use of conventions‚Äù.
Our job is to make stuff clear and obvious. If obvious is not an option, then at least self-explanatory. The main thing you need to know about instructions is that nobody is going to read them. We should aim for removing the instructions to make everything self-explanatory. But when they are necessary, cut as much as possible. (but, really, nobody is going to read them). We muddle through.
Take IKEA as an example. If you gave an average person to assemble a wardrobe from IKEA, I am sure that he will assemble it right most of the times. Why? It is, most of the cases, apparent on how it should be assembled if we have a clear picture in front of us. But even in instances where they look at the instructions, there are no words ‚Äî only images.
For most of the people, it is not essential to know or understand how your product works. Not because they are not intelligent, but merely because they do not care. So once they nail down the use of your product, they will rarely switch to something else.
Let‚Äôs take as an example the Apple AirPods. We can all admit that they are the worst sounding earbuds for the price you pay. But when I look at how people interact with it, I understand the real reason why they buy it. They do not make you think about why it is not working. You even don‚Äôt notice they have new technology.
I look at how my mom interacts with them, and she never asked me what technology is behind or how they work. She knows that whenever you open the case near your device, it is going to connect. It is that easy.
My favourite one. We, designers, love giving the users subtle effects and add beautiful delights. Right? Well, what if I told you that your users don‚Äôt care about it? No matter how much they tell you they do, they don‚Äôt. First time? Yes. Second? Ok. Third? Really, how much do I have to see this until it‚Äôs enough?
Why is this happening? Life is a much more stressful and demanding environment than an app‚Äôs delights and subtle effects. For example, you are a father, and your kid is screaming because he wants ice cream, the dog is barking because somebody is calling at the front door and you are trying to book a quick train ticket that should leave in 40 minutes. In that specific moment, people will not give a f* about your subtle cues. On the other side, we should use them, but not when it kills the user flow.
Focus group is a small group of people that sit around at the table and discuss things. They talk about their opinions about the product, past experiences, their feelings and reactions to new concepts. Focus groups are great for determining what your audience wants.
A usability test is about watching one person at a time trying to use something (your product in this case). In this case, you ask them to perform specific actions to see if you need to fix something in your concepts. So focus groups is about listening and usability tests are about watching.
All of us who design digital products have the moment when they say ‚Äî ‚ÄúI am a user too, so I know what is good or bad.‚Äù And because of that, we tend to have strong feelings about what we like and don‚Äôt.
We enjoy using products with ______, or we think that _____ is a big pain. And when we work on a team it tends to be hard to check those feelings at the door. The result is a room full of people with strong personal feelings on what it takes to design a great product. We tend to think that most of the users are like us.
It is not productive and will not add any value if you ask questions such as: ‚ÄúDo people like drop-down menus?‚Äù. The right question to ask is: ‚ÄúDoes this drop-down menu, with these words, in this context, on this page create a good experience for people who are likely to use the site?‚Äù
The reason for that is if we focus on what people like, we will lose focus and energy. Usability testing will erase any ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and show you what needs to be done.
The point is that every question that pops into our head, when using your product, only adds up to the cognitive workload. It distracts our attention from ‚Äúwhy I am here‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat I need to do‚Äù. And as a rule, people don‚Äôt enjoy solving puzzles when they merely want to know if that button is clickable or not.
And every time you make a user tap on something that does not work, or it looks like a button/link but it‚Äôs not, it also adds up to the pile of questions. And this happens because who built the product did not care too much about the product.
Make sure to share down in the comments small design mistakes we do on a daily basis for our products (whether apps or websites) so others can learn from them too. The article was written based on the revised version of the book Don‚Äôt Make Me Think by Steve Krug.

Tiantian Xu|44K|8|https://uxdesign.cc/100-days-of-motion-design-463526af852f?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|100 days of motion design ‚Äì UX Collective|"It was a summer night in Seattle. I ate some ice-cream, watched a Youtube tutorial, and downloaded a free trial of Principle. Several months later, I completed my 5th 100-day-project ‚Äî 100 Days of Motion.
I started my first 100-day-project back in 2015. My past projects include 100 Days of Doodle, 100 Days of Lettering, 100 Days of Watercolor, and 100 Days of Vector Illustration.
For me, 100-day-project is a creative outlet. It allows me to express myself through art. The joy of creation and the challenge of learning a new craft always keeps me coming back for more.
In 100 Days of Motion Design, I taught myself to animate and created 50 pieces of vector-based animation in 100 days. You can find all of them on Instagram and Dribbble.
Here is my creative process, the tools I used, and a reflection on the project.
During the first two weeks, I illustrated in Sketch and then imported it into Principle for animation.
After the first two weeks, I switched to Illustrator and After Effects for more advanced control.
Creating animation is time-consuming. I broke the creative process down into four steps and aimed to complete them in two days.
I collect motion design inspiration from Dribbble, Behance, and Instagram on a daily basis. My growing Pinterest board has been my go-to place for inspiration.
I also collect motion design tutorials on Youtube. Here is a list of tutorials I have used throughout my 100-day-project.
Once I had an idea, I sketched its key movements on my notebook.
I created the illustration and imported it into Principle or After Effects. Keeping the design file well-organized can significantly speed up the importation.
This tutorial shows how to prepare and import an Illustrator file into After Effects. Alternatively, the Sketch2AE plugin can import Sketch layers into After Effects.
I animated the illustration and exported the final animation as a short video. I posted the video to Instagram with the hashtag #100daysofmotionbytx
This tutorial shows how to export a video to GIF if you want to post animations to Dribbble.
I created my first animation by watching Principle‚ÄîSimple Character Animation (Jumping Donut).
I created an interactive prototype by following Principle ‚Äî Avatar Animation Using Scroll Gestures.
Soon enough, I was able to create animation in Principle without following tutorials.
During day 15‚Äì70, I developed the following methods to climb the learning curve of After Effects.
I watched the video tutorial in 1.5x speed and tried to create the animation from memory.
When necessary I wrote down the key steps and only revisited the tutorial if I felt stuck. I also made an effort to memorize the common After Effects shortcuts to help speed up the process.
I created the smoke effect after watching Smoke Animation ‚Äî After Effects Tutorial.
I created the lava lamp after watching After Effects Tutorial ‚Äî Lava Lamp.
I studied other people‚Äôs work on Dribbble frame by frame and then came up with my own idea.
I rebounded Bouncy Fruits by Deekay. I deconstructed his work to study the ‚ÄúSquash and Stretch‚Äù animation principle.
I rebounded Ducky Walk Cycle by Tony Babel. His tutorial After Effects‚ÄîWalk Cycle Tutorial taught me how to animate walk cycles. (The character was inspired by a doodle from Skinny Andy.)
Repetition is the key to reinforce a newly learned skill. I intentionally re-applied the skills I learned to create new animation.
I created the bouncy pumpkin by re-applying the ‚ÄúSquash and Stretch‚Äù animation principle.
I re-applied what I learned from Tony‚Äôs walk cycle tutorial to a flamingo.
Halfway through the 100-day-project, I took a day to read <Adobe After Effects CC Classroom in a Book>. I was able to connect the dots by revisiting the learned skills in a more systematic way. I also discovered new techniques that I wanted to try.
Once I became comfortable with the tools, I created animation from my heart.
Some of my work was inspired by my favorite games and movies.
Some of my work was inspired by other people‚Äôs illustrations.
Below was my submission to the Uplab loader design challenge. It pushed me out of my comfort zone and motivated me to learn new techniques.
I created artwork to promote Type Thursday Seattle ‚Äî a monthly design meetup that discusses work-in-progress projects that focus on letterforms.
I created animation for places I have been and places I want to go.
At the end of the 100-day-project, I rebounded the Galaxy Girl from my 100 Days of Watercolor.
Once I had an idea, I was driven to bring it to life. It did not matter what techniques I needed to learn.
For example, I wanted to express my love for reading. To make my idea of flipping book come true, I found a tutorial Open Your Book on Youtube and learned how to turn on 3D layer for a 2D object.
Similarly, I wanted to create a cup of pumpkin spice latte. I found a tutorial Flat 2D Smoke Clouds on Youtube and learned how to use slider control and wiggle expression.
I was optimistically confident about my motion design skill at the beginning of the project. My confidence dropped rapidly as I started exploring After Effects ‚Äî the huge skill gap made me realize how limited my experience and knowledge in motion design actually was.
The Dunning-Kruger effect describes the cognitive bias in which people of low-ability have illusory superiority and mistakenly assess their ability as greater than it is.
The more I became aware of my own incompetence, the humbler I became.
Before I started the 100-day-project, I spent most of my spare time consuming content: social media, Netflix... Sometimes I might even take an online class or read a book. But all of these things were just input.
In Internet culture, there is a ‚Äú1% rule‚Äù that describes the participation rate of an internet community: only 1% of the participants of a community actively create new content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 90% of the participants only view content.
Since I started the 100-day-project, I became a creator. I started making things I like, learning a new craft, and influencing people around me in a positive way.
Looking back, I‚Äôm thankful for people who created tutorials and posted them on Youtube for free. I am deeply motivated by all the creatives out there who are making beautiful things in volume, consistently.
Here are 10 creatives who have kept me inspired throughout the project:

Angela Guzman|43K|6|https://medium.com/@agzmn/the-making-of-apples-emoji-how-designing-these-tiny-icons-changed-my-life-16317250a9ee?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|The Making of Apple‚Äôs Emoji: How designing these tiny icons changed my life|"When design leads to friendship, and that friendship leads back to design, magic happens. This is the story of how an intern and her mentor designed Apple‚Äôs original emoji set and together changed the way people communicate around the world. It was also a project that led them to become lifelong friends, a key ingredient in the success of these tiny icons. In a nutshell, I was the intern and Raymond is my lifelong friend and mentor. In the course of three months, together we created some of the most widely used emoji: face with tears of joy, pile of poo, red heart, and party popper, plus around 460 additional ones. Later, as a full time Apple employee, I even got to create a few more.
It was the summer of 2008, and I was one year away from receiving my MFA in Graphic Design from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). It was the same summer I landed an internship at Apple on a team I was eager to meet. The same design team responsible for the iPhone; a magical device that launched the year prior at Macworld Expo in San Francisco. One could only imagine the size of my butterflies as I flew to Cupertino and arrived at 1 Infinite Loop. To add to the uncontrollable fluttering, I had no idea what project I would be given, the size of the team, where I would sit, or if I could really bike to work (I‚Äôm terrible on bikes).
Soon after my arrival and meeting the team (oh and biking to work!) I was handed my project. I was still trying to make sense of the assignment I‚Äôd just received when someone asked if I knew what an emoji was. And well, I didn‚Äôt, and at the time, neither did the majority of the English speaking world. I answered ‚Äòno‚Äô. This would all change, of course, as the iPhone would soon popularize them globally by offering an emoji keyboard. Moments later I learned what this Japanese word meant and that I was to draw hundreds of them. Just as I was looking down the hallway and internally processing, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt type or an exercise in layout, these are luscious illustrations,‚Äù I was assigned my mentor.
For the next three months Raymond and I would share an office and illustrated an array of faces, places, flags, animals, food, clothing, symbols, holidays, sports, and well, you probably know the rest. But long before any of this was complete, I had to learn how to design Apple-styled icons. We split the batch and the lesson in humility and craftsmanship began.
Raymond taught me everything there was to know about icon design. Little did I know that he, my humble mentor, was one of the best icon designers in the world. In other words, I sat next to one of the best iconographers, got to pick his brain until I could kick off my training wheels, all the while exchanging stories of our time growing up in South Florida including our trips to ‚ÄòPollo Tropical‚Äô in the search of amazing plantains. Lesson in humility, check.
My first emoji was the engagement ring, and I chose it because it had challenging textures like metal and a faceted gem, tricky to render for a beginner. The metal ring alone took me an entire day. Pretty soon, however, I could do two a day, then three, and so forth. Regardless of how fast I could crank one out, I constantly checked the details: the direction of the woodgrain, how freckles appeared on apples and eggplants, how leaf veins ran on a hibiscus, how leather was stitched on a football, the details were neverending. I tried really hard to capture all this in every pixel, zooming in and zooming out, because every detail mattered. And for three months I stared at hundreds of emoji on my screen. Somewhere in there we also had our first Steve Jobs review, which had created a shared experience of suspense and success when they were approved for launch. And if Steve said it was good to go, I‚Äôd say lesson in craftsmanship, check.
Sometimes our emoji turned out more comical than intended and some have a backstory. For example, Raymond reused his happy poop swirl as the top of the ice cream cone. Now that you know, bet you‚Äôll never forget. No one else who discovered this little detail did either.
Another example is the order in which we drew them. We left the tough ones to last, so the dancer with the red dress emerged towards the end of my internship as it was the one that kept getting punted. You can thank her ruffled dress for that and Raymond for the final output. The woman‚Äôs turquoise dress with the brown waist band, on the other hand, was one I drew earlier in the process. It was inspired by the color palette and proportions of a dress that my sister had created in real life that same year.
So from funny backstories to realizing he and I attended high schools less than 30 miles apart, our shared past and days drawing together triggered unstoppable laughing spells with watery eyes and all, in other words, with tears of joy. Ten years after my internship, Raymond and I still fill a room with laughter and he continues to provide me with the most flat out honest feedback to keep me in check, and vice versa. All this is what I believe made the emoji successful, our friendship through design.
This year will mark the tenth anniversary of Apple‚Äôs original emoji launch. They were first released in Japan on November of 2008, shortly after my internship at Apple concluded. I had no idea that within a few months of completing such project, it would revolutionize our culture‚Äôs way of communicating or how the emoji would physically appear everywhere. And I mean everywhere: toys, apparel, stickers, candy, music videos, books, jewelry, landmarks, movies, and whatever else you‚Äôve seen.
It should be noted that although Raymond and I, Angela Guzman, are the original Apple emoji designers responsible for the initial batch of close to 500 characters (and were awarded a US patent for them), there are of course additional Apple designers. Amongst them, Ollie Wagner created around a dozen of the original set after the conclusion of my internship, and many more the following year. The set now totals somewhere in the thousands ‚Äî some are even animated!
Ten years ago Raymond and I worked on one of my favorite projects to date, one that led me to experience my own ikigai. This Japanese term is defined as the place where one‚Äôs passion, mission, vocation, and profession intersect; what some would say the reason to get up in the morning ‚Äî literally me in 2008. I would eagerly wake up, and on the days I had to bike, I‚Äôd carry my bike down three long flights of stairs and head to work with a smile on my face. Now that‚Äôs magic!
On that note, I would suggest to any designer looking for their reason to get up in the morning to find their humble mentor, or be one, and get on the road to friendship. Because magic happens when design leads to friendship, and that friendship leads back to design. For every emoji made, I learned something new. For every emoji made, Raymond and I became better friends. The better friends we became, the better designer I became. In this case, friendship and design happened one emoji at a time. And that‚Äôs a story worth sharing.

Ian Armstrong|14.2K|10|https://uxplanet.org/the-evolution-of-ux-process-methodology-47f52557178b?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|The Evolution of UX Process Methodology ‚Äì UX Planet|"In the beginning there was Donald A. Norman, and he created the idea of user experience design.
By 2016, Don Norman was pretty vocal about how badly misunderstood the term had become. He talks about it in this short YouTube video. These days he says he‚Äôs a people designer (apologies, I‚Äôve misplaced the interview link), sort of, but he‚Äôs non-committal about the title.
I can‚Äôt think of a better place to start unraveling the weird and confusing world of modern UX Design than this: Not even the originator of our field knows what to call himself anymore.
De-obfuscating modern UX requires understanding the history of both design and development since the 1990s. They‚Äôre intrinsically linked, so it helps to start just a few years after it all began.
In its purest form, UX Design is waterfall based.
A product team working through the waterfall methodology sets out to learn everything they possibly can before building even the simplest prototype. Research can take months, or even years to complete; and the results dictate a design team‚Äôs execution. The requirements lock before design kicks off, and design locks before development kicks off. There‚Äôs no going back, not until version 2.0. That‚Äôs just how waterfall operates.
A classic UX process is usually taught to college students. It goes like this:
That‚Äôs basically a waterfall. The classic elements of UX (Jesse James Garrett) also follow a waterfall schema, building an execution from the bottom up based on well articulated requirements.
The problem is that classic UX is fundamentally incompatible with agile.
For a long time innovation in the Silicon Valley was driven by Moore‚Äôs Law, which states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. Superimpose a waterfall process and you‚Äôll notice that it fits nicely into a 24 month cadence. Business, design, and development cycles worked like a Swiss timepiece; perfectly attuned to the release of a new Intel chipset.
Then one day Sony, Toshiba, and IBM (The STI Alliance) decided that Moore‚Äôs Law was too slow.
STI created the first cell chip, which stacked 8 microprocessor cores on a single wafer, and the damn thing actually worked (it powered the Playstation 2). Multi-core architecture changed everything.
Moore‚Äôs law didn‚Äôt break, it got life-hacked. What did break was waterfall.
Almost overnight speed and flexibility replaced precision and predictability as competitive advantages. Companies turned en masse to another well established but underutilized development methodology: Agile.
Agile focuses on rapid iteration. It releases a new set of shippable increments (features) every 2-4 weeks, evolving a product over time instead of all at once. It‚Äòs based on hypothesis, experimentation, rapid release, and real-time measurement. In Agile there is no editing stage, there is no perfection. As Bre Pettis put it in 2009... done is the engine of more.
Waterfall‚Äôs painstaking ‚Äúmeasure twice, cut once‚Äù approach went out of style faster than a StarTAC in a room full of iPhones.
Classic UX operated on a waterfall cadence.
With feature releases happening once or twice a month there wasn‚Äôt time to wait for UX Designers to execute their process. In Agile nomenclature, UX became a blocker, and it was a bad one.
Faced with an immovable block most teams simply abandoned UX. In its place they hired young graphic designers who were capable of turning out assets on a two-week cadence. Those designers weren‚Äôt real UXers, not in the classic sense, but they knew just enough about user centered design to avoid making the worst types of mistakes.
That was okay with product development teams. The details, they figured, would work themselves out through iteration.
Care to take a guess at what the Agile title for that type of designer was?
If you answered ‚ÄúUI/UX Designer‚Äù give yourself a cookie.
UI/UX Designers were at the heart of the storm when Apple proved that a design-lead business could become the most valuable brand in the world. They carried the torch of UX when UX itself couldn‚Äôt sharpen a pencil inside of a two-week sprint, let alone design a feature.
It came at a cost though.
The UI/UX bias towards digital and graphic design badly skewed the business world‚Äôs perception what an experience designer does. To this day, far too many businesses still think of UX as a visual discipline. As Don Norman has been trying to explain, that‚Äôs incorrect.
Things didn‚Äôt start to get better until 2013.
Lean UX was Jeff Gothelf‚Äôs game changing answer to the problem of practicing UX in an agile environment. In his seminal masterwork, Jeff turned the entire field of UX on its head. The book introduces a series of strategy and alignment activities, which allow UX to operate inside of agile‚Äôs cone of uncertainty and rapidly update designs based on user feedback.
Whereas classic UX is requirements based, Lean UX is outcome based. If you need a quick primer on how that works, O‚ÄôReilly has a free chapter available online that breaks things down in no-nonsense terms.
Lean UX wasn‚Äôt perfect though. While UX was now able to harmonize with an agile cadence, the lean model broke down if a product was vaguely defined (basically anything un-launched).
Designers found themselves under immense pressure to fill a sprint backlog before they really understood what they were building. As a result, a lot of development cycles got burned on features that never made it into the final product. In project management circles, the Lean UX / Agile pairing was known for a high volume of waste and rework when attempted under less than ideal conditions.
In a mature product there is lots of user feedback coming in, which does wonderful job of driving the iterative cycle that powers Lean UX. That‚Äôs why Lean UX is the industry standard on almost any established product team. Nobody in their right mind would change a thing.
On establishing teams, however, the user feedback cycle has yet to ignite itself. The waste and rework problem in those circumstances was serious enough that it often crippled the adoption of Lean UX. This presented a real conundrum for startups and skunkworks units that wanted to ensure a strong UX component without reverting back to a waterfall cadence.
Jake Knapp and Google Ventures came out of the sky like a bolt of lightning and solved the problem with the design sprint. Nobody saw it coming. Nobody cared. The long dark night of UX was finally over.
Addendum: The design sprint has its roots in the IDEO human centered design process, which is closely linked to Stanford and the d.school there. McKinsey authored a similar type of sprint using the same conceptual roots. All of that traces back to Stanley Pollitt and the roots of user-centered design in advertising but that‚Äôs a story for another day.
If you were to look at a design sprint and say ‚Äúwait, that‚Äôs just really fast classic UX‚Äù you wouldn‚Äôt be far off the mark. The difference (and genius) is that it‚Äôs classic UX at an incredibly low fidelity. It‚Äôs the difference between an artistic masterpiece and a napkin sketch ‚Äî but it works.
The goal of a design sprint is to take all of the existing research about a problem, unpack its essence to a diverse group, then ideate like crazy. The ideations are then funneled through the lenses of human centered design and those that survive are voted on by the team. Designers then build a low-fidelity prototype (often in just one day) that is just barely good enough to test on potential users. The results of the test, if positive, create a target for designers to hit in high-fidelity; thus fueling the Lean UX/Agile cycle.
Magic.
IMPORTANT: dual-track agile often refers to the split between research and design in a Lean UX environment. I‚Äôve updated this article to refer to dual-track design in hopes of reducing confusion.
So now we come to the point of modern day UX methodology.
As you might expect, dual track design has two tracks (a Sherlock Holmes level deduction, I know, don‚Äôt everybody gasp at once):
A production team is typically running on track two unless the backlog becomes poorly defined. If that happens, the problem is assessed and the team runs a design sprint. Problem solved.
But where does that assessment come from if the production team is busy practicing Lean UX?
The most effective answer is to put a dedicated team on it. While design & development pumps out iterations, a research team investigates the results much more comprehensively in the background. Because that research team isn‚Äôt bound to an Agile sprint cadence they still have the luxury of taking 3 months to reach a conclusion.
Every few months a fresh infusion of new insight will hit the production teams, filling their backlog with new ideas for experimentation. At one of the companies I work with, we‚Äôve now got a whole data science team feeding knowledge to multiple creative units. The insight is infrequent, as researchers have much longer delivery cycles, but when it comes down the line it‚Äôs wonderful.
Sometimes the insight is big enough to trigger a design sprint, which significantly evolves a product vision. Most of the time, however, it just adds additional kindling to the fire of Lean UX experimentation.
So yes, dual track works best when a dedicated research team is working outside the scope of the active product group. You‚Äôve probably surmised that it‚Äôs an expensive undertaking. You‚Äôre not wrong.
What I can tell you is that it‚Äôs less expensive than the alternatives: operating without UX or dealing with the waste and rework problem of pure lean.
Fund it out of your savings.
So what is a UX Designer in a dual-track world?
A UX Designer is a leader, a process evangelist, a generator of insight, a purveyor of context, and a creative ideation machine. UX Design, as I‚Äôve said elsewhere, doesn‚Äôt really have any deliverables other than value. It has come to encompass dozens of job titles that have hundreds of their own deliverables though.
Most of us aren‚Äôt actually UX Designers unless we lead a team, rather, we work in the field of UX Design.
It‚Äôs enough to confuse anyone.
It‚Äôs enough to exasperate even Donald A. Norman.

Nathan Gitter|30K|6|https://medium.com/@nathangitter/why-your-app-looks-better-in-sketch-3a01b22c43d7?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|Why Your App Looks Better in Sketch ‚Äì Nathan Gitter ‚Äì Medium|"Can you spot the differences between these two images?
If you look hard enough, you might notice a few subtle differences:
The image on the right:
The image on the left is a screenshot from Sketch, and the image on the right is a reproduction on iOS. These differences arise when the graphics are rendered. They have the exact same font, line spacing, shadow radius, colors, and gradient attributes ‚Äî all of the constants are identical.
As you can see, some aspects of the original design can be lost during the conversion from the design file to real code. We‚Äôre going to explore some of these details so you can know what to watch for and how to fix them.
Design is critical to a successful mobile app. Especially on iOS, users are accustomed to apps that work well and look good.
If you‚Äôre a mobile app designer or developer, you know how important small details are to the end user experience. High-quality software can only come from people who care deeply about their craft.
There are many reasons why apps might not look as good as their original designs. We‚Äôre going to investigate one of the more subtle reasons ‚Äî differences in rendering between Sketch and iOS.
Certain types of user interface elements have noticeable differences between Sketch and iOS. We are going to explore the following elements:
Typography can be implemented in various ways, but for this test I am going to use labels (‚ÄúText‚Äù element in Sketch, UILabel in iOS).
Let‚Äôs look at some of the differences:
The biggest difference in the example above is the location of line breaks. The third grouping of text starting with ‚ÄúThis text is SF Semibold‚Äù breaks after the word ‚Äú25‚Äù in the design, but after the word ‚Äúpoints‚Äù in the app. This same problem occurs with the paragraph of text‚Äîthe line breaks are inconsistent.
Another smaller difference is that the leading (line spacing) and tracking (character spacing) are slightly larger in Sketch.
It‚Äôs easier to see these differences when they are directly overlaid:
What about other typefaces? Replacing San Francisco with Lato (a widely used free font), we get the following results:
Much better!
There are still some differences in leading and tracking, but these are generally small. Be careful though‚Äîif the text needs to align with other elements like background images, these small offsets can be noticeable.
Some of these issues are related to the default iOS font: San Francisco. When iOS renders the system font, it automatically includes tracking based on the point size. This automatically-applied tracking table is available on Apple‚Äôs website. There is a Sketch plugin called ‚ÄúSF Font Fixer‚Äù which reflects these values in Sketch. I highly recommend it if your design uses San Francisco.
(Side Note: Always remember to make the text box wrap tightly around text in Sketch. This can be done by selecting the text and toggling between ‚ÄúFixed‚Äù and ‚ÄúAuto‚Äù alignment, then resetting the width of the text box. If there is any extra spacing, this can easily lead to incorrect values being entered into the layout.)
Unlike typography which has universal layout rules, shadows are less well-defined.
As we can see in the image above, shadows in iOS are larger by default. In the examples above, this makes the most difference on the top edges of the rectangles.
Shadows are tricky because the parameters between Sketch and iOS are not the same. The biggest difference is that there is no concept of ‚Äúspread‚Äù on a CALayer, although this can be overcome by increasing the size of the layer that contains the shadow.
Shadows can vary wildly in their difference between Sketch and iOS. I‚Äôve seen some shadows with the exact same parameters look great in Sketch but be nearly invisible when running on a real device.
Shadows are tricky and require manual adjustment to match the original design. Oftentimes, the shadow radius will need to be lower and the opacity will need to be higher.
The required changes vary based on size, color, and shape ‚Äî here, we only need a few minor adjustments.
Gradients prove to be troublesome as well.
Of the three gradients, only the ‚Äúorange‚Äù (top) and ‚Äúblue‚Äù (bottom right) differ.
The orange gradient looks more horizontal in Sketch, but more vertical in iOS. As a result, the overall color of the gradient is darker in the final app than the design.
The difference is more noticeable in the blue gradient‚Äîthe angle is more vertical in iOS. This gradient is defined by three colors: light blue in the bottom left corner, dark blue in the middle, and pink in the top right corner.
The start and ending points may need to be adjusted if the gradient is angled. Try offsetting the startPoint and endPoint of your CAGradientLayer slightly to account for these differences.
There‚Äôs no magic formula here*‚Äîthe values need to be adjusted and iterated until the results visually match.
*Jirka TrÃåecÃåaÃÅk posted an excellent response with links explaining how the gradient rendering works. Check it out if you want to dive deep into more code!
I built a demo app to easily see these differences on a real device. It includes the examples above, along with source code and original Sketch file so you can tweak the constants to your heart‚Äôs content.
This is a great way to increase awareness within your team‚Äîjust hand them your phone and they can see for themselves. Simply touch anywhere on the screen to toggle bewteen the images (similar to the gifs above).
Get the open-source demo app here: https://github.com/nathangitter/sketch-vs-ios
Don‚Äôt assume that equal values imply equal results. Even if the numbers match, the visual appearance may not.
At the end of the day, there needs to be iteration after any design is implemented. Good collaboration between design and engineering is crucial for a high-quality end product.

Slava Shestopalov|20K|7|https://medium.muz.li/icon-set-3b4fc87dc6b5?source=tag_archive---------7---------------------|Hopefully, the Ultimate Guide to a Flat Icon Set ‚Äì Muzli - Design Inspiration|"An interface icon usually can be approximated to one of the basic formats: a landscape rectangle, a portrait rectangle, a diagonal rectangle, a circle, a triangle, a square. Blurring shows they have equal visual weight because they turn into more or less the same blobs.
Depending on an icon shape, inscribe it into a corresponding frame of the optical grid. For example, squarish icons are more compact than triangular or elongated ones.
The more compact an icon is, the less space it needs. The more sharp edges or small details an icon has, the more artboard space it should occupy.
Beware of becoming your grid‚Äôs slave. It is to help, not to restrict. If an icon is visually better with some sticking out elements, let them stick out.
To make icons sharp on non-retina screens, stick to the pixel grid and give preference to 2-pixel borders for line icons. Centered 2-pixel borders provide enough thickness and crisp silhouettes.
If you choose 1-pixel borders for icons, they should be either outer or inner but not centered.
Centered 1-pixel borders make an icon blurred at 100 % scale, although it seems sharp if you zoom in.
Set the start and end points of diagonals in accordance with the pixel grid. Diagonals with the angles of 45¬∞, 30¬∞ and 60¬∞ look sharper than diagonals with uneven angles like 13.7¬∞ or 81¬∞.
It‚Äôs better to start an icon set from the most complex icon. It will define the level of detail and help to make icons of the same visual weight.
When icons have different levels of detail, the more detailed ones attract more user‚Äôs attention and seem visually heavier.
The space between neighboring elements of an icon shouldn‚Äôt be too small or inconsistent throughout a set. Define the minimal gap and keep it everywhere to avoid contour ‚Äústicking‚Äù.
For line icons, it‚Äôs good to make the minimal space equal to the line thickness. Lines should be either distinctly separate or accurately connected, never almost connected.
In the sets of icons, you might have repeating details. Get rid of them to focus viewer‚Äôs attention on what is different. It‚Äôs like fraction simplifying in maths. The less graphic noise you see, the clearer your understanding is.
If the target user already realizes what he or she works with, there is no need to repeat that again and again. For instance, avoiding envelope-based icons won‚Äôt make people think this is not an email app.
This rule also concerns various decorations ‚Äî frames, backgrounds ‚Äî around an icon. If they don‚Äôt help to read an icon, they hinder to read an icon.
Don‚Äôt mix showing volume with frontal depiction within one icon set. Style consistency will help users to recognize icons and understand that they have equal importance or state.
The same principle works with line icons and filled icons. If you mix them, people might think they have different importance or status. Of course, unless you deliberately want that. For instance, a filled icon is for the key command, and line icons are for other commands.
It‚Äôs nice to have two variants of each icon in interfaces. A line icon ‚Äî for the disabled or regular state. A filled icon ‚Äî for the clicked state.
The 8-pixel grid and 12-column layout are used for many interfaces as more flexible compared to decimal-based sizing. 12 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, and 6. So, the 24- or 48-pixel icon areas have become standard. These icons can be scaled if a larger size is needed.
Perfectionism is not the goal. No one needs pixel-perfect lines for the sake of pixel-perfect lines. But this is important for proper, not distorted icon rendering in the final product. Keep in mind the minimal needed number of shape anchors and absence of gaps between adjacent elements.
The same story with annoying ‚Äú8.999 px‚Äù or ‚Äú100.001 px‚Äù sizes. If the shape anchors are located accurately, icon edges look sharp. And you don‚Äôt run the risk of getting excessive anchors and gaps when you merge shapes.
Many interface editors like Sketch can produce SVGs with unnecessary artifacts ‚Äî excessive groups, color layers and clipping masks. Let‚Äôs see. In Sketch, everything looks good.
Open this SVG in a different editor (for instance, Adobe Illustrator). You‚Äôll notice empty layers, unnecessary groups, and sometimes clipping masks. All these things might cause problems when frontend developers convert icons into an iconfont or use SVGs on a webpage.
You can remove this trash and save.
You‚Äôll see that the Sketch SVG (picture.svg) and edited Illustrator SVG (picture_new.svg) have different previews in your file viewer. By the way, it‚Äôs possible to get rid of trash in an icon in a code editor. If you know how SVG code looks like, try deleting unnecessary data strings directly.
Of course, all these recommendations aren‚Äôt absolute truth. If you know what you do, skip them. Here are the cases when, in my opinion, strict geometric icons won‚Äôt be the best choice.
I guess you are here because of how-tos, aren‚Äôt you? We all love tips and tricks. But probably you are up to thinking about something behind pixels and ideal shapes. If yes, I recommend this article:

Angela Zhang|11.3K|11|https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-write-a-good-software-design-document-66fcf019569c?source=tag_archive---------8---------------------|How to write a good software design doc ‚Äì freeCodeCamp.org|"As a software engineer, I spend a lot of time reading and writing design documents. After having gone through hundreds of these docs, I‚Äôve seen first hand a strong correlation between good design docs and the ultimate success of the project.
This article is my attempt at describing what makes a design document great.
The article is split into 4 sections:
A design doc ‚Äî also known as a technical spec ‚Äî is a description of how you plan to solve a problem.
There are lots of writings already on why it‚Äôs important to write a design doc before diving into coding. So all I‚Äôll say here is:
A design doc is the most useful tool for making sure the right work gets done.
The main goal of a design doc is to make you more effective by forcing you to think through the design and gather feedback from others. People often think the point of a design doc is to to teach others about some system or serve as documentation later on. While those can be beneficial side effects, they are not the goal in and of themselves.
As a general rule of thumb, if you are working on a project that might take 1 engineer-month or more, you should write a design doc. But don‚Äôt stop there ‚Äî a lot of smaller projects could benefit from a mini design doc too.
Great! If you are still reading, you believe in the importance of design docs. However, different engineering teams, and even engineers within the same team, often write design docs very differently. So let‚Äôs talk about the content, style, and process of a good design doc.
A design doc describes the solution to a problem. Since the nature of each problem is different, naturally you‚Äôd want to structure your design doc differently.
To start, the following is a list of sections that you should at least consider including in your next design doc:
The title of your design doc, the author(s) (should be the same as the list of people planning to work on this project), the reviewer(s) of the doc (we‚Äôll talk more about that in the Process section below), and the date this document was last updated.
A high level summary that every engineer at the company should understand and use to decide if it‚Äôs useful for them to read the rest of the doc. It should be 3 paragraphs max.
A description of the problem at hand, why this project is necessary, what people need to know to assess this project, and how it fits into the technical strategy, product strategy, or the team‚Äôs quarterly goals.
The Goals section should:
Non-Goals are equally important to describe which problems you won‚Äôt be fixing so everyone is on the same page.
A list of measurable checkpoints, so your PM and your manager‚Äôs manager can skim it and know roughly when different parts of the project will be done. I encourage you to break the project down into major user-facing milestones if the project is more than 1 month long.
Use calendar dates so you take into account unrelated delays, vacations, meetings, and so on. It should look something like this:
Start Date: June 7, 2018Milestone 1 ‚Äî New system MVP running in dark-mode: June 28, 2018Milestone 2 - Retire old system: July 4th, 2018End Date: Add feature X, Y, Z to new system: July 14th, 2018
Add an [Update] subsection here if the ETA of some of these milestone changes, so the stakeholders can easily see the most up-to-date estimates.
In addition to describing the current implementation, you should also walk through a high level example flow to illustrate how users interact with this system and/or how data flow through it.
A user story is a great way to frame this. Keep in mind that your system might have different types of users with different use cases.
Some people call this the Technical Architecture section. Again, try to walk through a user story to concretize this. Feel free to include many sub-sections and diagrams.
Provide a big picture first, then fill in lots of details. Aim for a world where you can write this, then take a vacation on some deserted island, and another engineer on the team can just read it and implement the solution as you described.
What else did you consider when coming up with the solution above? What are the pros and cons of the alternatives? Have you considered buying a 3rd-party solution ‚Äî or using an open source one ‚Äî that solves this problem as opposed to building your own?
I like including this section, because people often treat this as an afterthought or skip it all together, and it almost always comes back to bite them later when things break and they have no idea how or why.
How will this increase on call and dev-ops burden? How much money will it cost? Does it cause any latency regression to the system? Does it expose any security vulnerabilities? What are some negative consequences and side effects? How might the support team communicate this to the customers?
Any open issues that you aren‚Äôt sure about, contentious decisions that you‚Äôd like readers to weigh in on, suggested future work, and so on.
This section is mostly going to be read only by the engineers working on this project, their tech leads, and their managers. Hence this section is at the end of the doc.
Essentially, this is the breakdown of how and when you plan on executing each part of the project. There‚Äôs a lot that goes into scoping accurately, so you can read this post to learn more about scoping.
I tend to also treat this section of the design doc as an ongoing project task tracker, so I update this whenever my scoping estimate changes. But that‚Äôs more of a personal preference.
Now that we‚Äôve talked about what goes into a good design doc, let‚Äôs talk about the style of writing. I promise this is different than your high school English class.
Don‚Äôt try to write like the academic papers you‚Äôve read. They are written to impress journal reviewers. Your doc is written to describe your solution and get feedback from your teammates. You can achieve clarity by using:
Charts can often be useful to compare several potential options, and diagrams are generally easier to parse than text. I‚Äôve had good luck with Google Drawing for creating diagrams.
Pro Tip: remember to add a link to the editable version of the diagram under the screenshot, so you can easily update it later when things inevitably change.
The scale of the problem often determines the solution. To help reviewers get a sense of the state of the world, include real numbers like # of DB rows, # of user errors, latency ‚Äî and how these scale with usage (remember your Big-O notations?).
A spec is not an academic paper. Also, people like reading funny things, so this is a good way to keep the reader engaged. Don‚Äôt overdo this to the point of taking away from the core idea though.
If you, like me, have trouble being funny, Joel Spolsky (obviously known for his comedic talents...) has this tip:
Before sending your design doc to others to review, take a pass at it pretending to be the reviewer. What questions and doubts might you have about this design? Then address them preemptively.
If you go on a long vacation now with no internet access, can someone on your team read the doc and implement it as you intended?
The main goal of a design doc is not knowledge sharing, but this is a good way to evaluate for clarity so that others can actually give you useful feedback.
Ah yes, the dreaded P-word. Design docs help you get feedback before you waste a bunch of time implementing the wrong solution or the solution to the wrong problem. There‚Äôs a lot of art to getting good feedback, but that‚Äôs for a later article. For now, let‚Äôs just talk specifically about how to write the design doc and get feedback for it.
First of all, everyone working on the project should be a part of the design process. It‚Äôs okay if the tech lead ends up driving a lot of the decisions, but everyone should be involved in the discussion and buy into the design. So the ‚Äúyou‚Äù throughout this article is a really plural ‚Äúyou‚Äù that includes all the people on the project.
Secondly, the design process doesn‚Äôt mean you staring at the whiteboard theorizing ideas. Feel free to get your hands dirty and prototype potential solutions. This is not the same as starting to write production code for the project before writing a design doc. Don‚Äôt do that. But you absolutely should feel free to write some hacky throwaway code to validate an idea. To ensure that you only write exploratory code, make it a rule that none of this prototype code gets merged to master.
After that, as you start to have some idea of how to go about your project, do the following:
Doing all of this before you even start writing your design doc lets you get feedback as soon as possible, before you invest more time and get attached to any specific solution. Often, even if the implementation stays the same, your reviewer is able to point out corner cases you need to cover, indicate any potential areas of confusion, and anticipate difficulties you might encounter later on.
Then, after you‚Äôve written a rough draft of your design doc, get the same reviewer to read through it again, and rubber stamp it by adding their name as the reviewer in the Title and People section of the design doc. This creates additional incentive and accountability for the reviewer.
On that note, consider adding specialized reviewers (such as SREs and security engineers) for specific aspects of the design.
Once you and the reviewer(s) sign off, feel free to send the design doc to your team for additional feedback and knowledge sharing. I suggest time-bounding this feedback gathering process to about 1 week to avoid extended delays. Commit to addressing all questions and comments people leave within that week. Leaving comments hanging = bad karma.
Lastly, if there‚Äôs a lot of contention between you, your reviewer, and other engineers reading the doc, I strongly recommend consolidating all the points of contention in the Discussion section of your doc. Then, set up a meeting with the different parties to talk about these disagreements in person.
Whenever a discussion thread is more than 5 comments long, moving to an in-person discussion tends to be far more efficient. Keep in mind that you are still responsible for making the final call, even if everyone can‚Äôt come to a consensus.
In talking to Shrey Banga recently about this, I learned that Quip has a similar process, except in addition to having an experienced engineer or tech lead on your team as a reviewer, they also suggest having an engineer on a different team review the doc. I haven‚Äôt tried this, but I can certainly see this helping get feedback from people with different perspectives and improve the general readability of the doc.
Once you‚Äôve done all the above, time to get going on the implementation! For extra brownie points, treat this design doc as a living document as you implement the design. Update the doc every time you learn something that leads to you making changes to the original solution or update your scoping. You‚Äôll thank me later when you don‚Äôt have to explain things over and over again to all your stakeholders.
Finally, let‚Äôs get really meta for a second: How do we evaluate the success of a design doc?
My coworker Kent Rakip has a good answer to this: A design doc is successful if the right ROI of work is done. That means a successful design doc might actually lead to an outcome like this:
At the beginning of this article, we said the goal of a design doc is to make sure the right work gets done. In the example above, thanks to this design doc, instead of wasting potentially months only to abort this project later, you‚Äôve only spent 8 days. Seems like a pretty successful outcome to me.
Please leave a comment below if you have any questions or feedback! I‚Äôd also love to hear about how you do design docs differently in your team.

How Apple beat Swiss watchmakers at their own game

It‚Äôs no secret that some of the most recognizable watch brands in the world are made in Switzerland. While the notion of a product being ‚ÄúSwiss-made‚Äù may seem like it‚Äôs been around forever, it‚Äôs a relatively recent phenomenon.
The first watches that most closely resemble today‚Äôs wristwatches were conceived by Peter Henlein, a German locksmith who lived in Nuremberg during the 16th century. The ‚ÄúTaschenuhren‚Äù were early gadgets, status symbols that only the upper class and social elite could afford. For more than a century, the design of pocket watches remained relatively unchanged. Then, a range of British innovations changed watchmaking as we know it.
The invention of the balance spring, the horizontal escapement, and the chronometer led Britain to become one of the most respected watchmaking countries in the world by the end of the 18th century. They were the most precise, best-crafted watches money could buy. However, they had one critical design flaw: these early watches were too thick to wear comfortably.
As fashion and comfort demanded thinner watches, watchmakers all over Europe began to investigate new ways of building slimmer clockworks. The challenges of early watchmaking closely mirror the challenges smartwatch producers face today: how to make technology smaller and more powerful.
It was the craftsmanship and vision of a Swiss master watchmaker, Abraham-Louis Breguet, that inspired the modern wristwatch we know today ‚Äî large, flat, sleek, and stylish. If the British had bet on accuracy, the Swiss would bet on style. It didn‚Äôt take long until Switzerland established itself as home to a range of high-quality watch producers, most notably Longines, IWC Schaffhausen, and Rolex with its first chronometer certified wristwatch.
From the early 20th century until 1960, the Swiss were unrivaled as the world‚Äôs top watchmakers. They began to imprint their watches with a seal. Different versions of this seal existed originally, though as longer names soon became problematic due to a watch face‚Äôs small size, the industry converged on two simple words: ‚ÄúSwiss Made.‚Äù
Soon, ‚ÄúSwiss Made‚Äù became one of the most sought-after seals in the history of consumer goods.
A 2016 survey by the University of St. Gallen found that respondents were willing to pay up to 100 percent more for a Swiss luxury watch, as compared to one with no known origin. Even the Swiss government‚Äôs website boasts about the seal: ‚Äú‚ÄòSwiss Made‚Äô is more than a simple label of origin. It is a sign to customers that they are buying a product of outstanding quality and reliability.‚Äù
While the Swiss were sticking to traditional watchmaking methods, a Japanese company, Seiko, introduced the world‚Äôs first battery-based wristwatch in 1969. This unleashed yet another revolution in the watchmaking world.
The cheap production costs of this new battery-based wristwatch drove down global prices, and the Swiss Made watch industry lost more than 60,000 jobs. At the end of 1982, over 1,000 watch manufacturers disappeared globally. This moment ‚Äî after Seiko‚Äôs introduction of the Quartz Astron 35SQ watch in 1969 ‚Äî became commonly known as the ‚Äúquartz crisis.‚Äù
In order to survive this horological upheaval, the Swiss needed to innovate.
Through radical ideas and outrageous design, Nicolas Hayek reinvented the Swiss watch with his newly founded Swatch Group. His mantra for this new line of watches was, ‚ÄúInnovation, provocation, fun, forever.‚Äù This mantra didn‚Äôt just manifest in the product itself, but also in how it was advertised.
Swatch Group made plastic watches cool. This led to completely different product positioning. Swatch de-linked the watch from its core timekeeping function and turned it into a fashion statement.
Watches were no longer about their intricate clockworks ‚Äî they were now an avenue for self-expression. This shift from technology to fashion would soon become even more important in the age of smartphones and smartwatches. But it would still be decades before anyone knew what a ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button was.
For more than 30 years after the launch of the Swatch watch, the industry remained remarkably stable as Switzerland re-established itself as the global watchmaking leader.
It would take the vision and marketing powerhouse of another giant to disrupt the industry once more.
Smartwatches aren‚Äôt a new concept. Since the Seiko TV watch that James Bond wore in Octopussy, we‚Äôve been dreaming about putting screens on our wrists. Unfortunately, all early attempts had bulky designs and short battery life. Not surprisingly, none of them became commercial successes.
That changed in 2012, when Eric Migicovsky launched a kickstarter campaign for his phone-paired smartwatch called Pebble. Though the campaign‚Äôs goal was to raise $100,000 to start production, they ended up with a staggering $10 million instead. With its unique user experience, long battery life, and its ability to seamlessly connect to both iOS and Android systems, the Pebble watch became the first commercially successful smartwatch of the 2000s.
Unfortunately, Pebble would soon lose to a new smartwatch player about to enter the ring.
In early 2014, news surfaced that Apple had reached out to Swiss watchmakers for a potential collaboration. Swatch Group‚Äôs CEO Nicolas Hayek told the press, ‚ÄúWe see no reason why we should enter into any partnership agreement.‚Äù
Hayek, stigmatized by a previous smartwatch failure in a collaboration with Microsoft, firmly believed that technical constraints would ultimately doom this category of device.
Just a week before Apple‚Äôs product launch in 2014, Jonathan Ive told the New York Times that the Swiss were in trouble. A few days later, people would get a chance to see for themselves.
On September 9, 2014, right after presenting the iPhone 6, Tim Cook took the stage and told a packed audience that Apple had one more thing to present. He went on to unveil not the iWatch as expected, but the Apple Watch instead. Cook called it, ‚Äú... the next chapter in Apple‚Äôs story.‚Äù
Many experts were skeptical about the Apple Watch‚Äôs industrial design. Tag Heuer‚Äôs CEO Jean-Claude Biver told the press, ‚ÄúTo be totally honest, it looks like it was designed by a student in their first trimester.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt take long for Biver to revise his statement.
The critical feedback didn‚Äôt stop Apple from moving the industry forward. Shortly after launch, the first version of the Apple Watch became the bestselling smartwatch of all time. With the announcement of Series 3, Tim Cook went a step further and clarified Apple Watch‚Äôs position within the watch industry once and for all.
And for all of my Swiss friends who‚Äôre possibly still in denial, in September 2017 Cook was kind enough to remind everyone that their smartwatch is the best selling watch, period.
But there was something fundamentally different about the Apple event that year: The Apple Watch was presented before the new iPhones.
What differentiated the first Apple Watch from earlier devices of its class wasn‚Äôt just the seamless interplay of hardware and software, but Apple‚Äôs unique ability to make new technology feel familiar. Unlike their early competitors, Apple had another critical ace up their sleeve: They built upon the familiarity of traditional wristwatches, combining it with the Apple design language they‚Äôd successfully established with iPod and iPhone.
Perhaps even more remarkable is the fact that for over three years, Apple barely made any changes to the watch‚Äôs industrial design. This rather slow update cycle is perhaps part of the reason the watch‚Äôs design was able to become iconic. You either have an Apple Watch or you don‚Äôt. Whether it‚Äôs series 1, 2, or 3, it doesn‚Äôt matter. By sticking to its initial design, Apple bet against consumer culture‚Äôs neomania, which religiously replaces tech gadgets on an annual basis.
The Apple Watch is almost an homage to traditional watchmaking. Through the enduring nature of the Apple Watch‚Äôs design, Apple is perhaps saying that smartwatches should be a bit more timeless than their smartphone counterparts.
Apple went a step further and even adopted traditional horologic terms to describe parts of the user interface. Many computer designers find the term ‚Äúcomplications‚Äù awkward, but watchmakers called things for what they were. Essentially, ‚Äúcomplications‚Äù ‚Äî in watchmaking terms ‚Äî do just what the word suggests: they make watches more complicated by adding the date, chronographs, winding mechanisms, etc. But while complications in mechanical watches are mostly designed to show off craftsmanship, complications in smartwatches aim at delivering relevant information at the right time. Apple adopts the term ‚Äúcomplications‚Äù to describe app data on the watch face. They‚Äôve also adopted another traditional watchmaking term, ‚Äúcrown,‚Äù to name the ‚Äúdigital crown‚Äù on the side of the device.
By using the same language and basic principles of watchmaking, Apple ensured their product was distinct enough to feel innovative, yet familiar enough to find its place on our wrists.
New products don‚Äôt replace one another as much as they change what those other products stand for. People who buy automatic watches aren‚Äôt buying an accessory, they‚Äôre buying pieces of history and craftsmanship. People who buy smartwatches aren‚Äôt buying a better way to look at time, they‚Äôre buying the idea of a healthier and better connected self.
Steve Jobs was deeply convinced that the Phone app was the iPhone‚Äôs ‚Äúkiller app.‚Äù And indeed, the first version of Phone app was a brilliantly designed piece of software that truly helped establish the iPhone as a phone. But the expectations of iPhone have evolved ever since. The Phone app became a side product of what iPhone stands for today.
Smartwatches are redefining their own category just like Swatch did in the late 1980s. Whereas smartwatches used to be about staying connected, they‚Äôre now packed with habit-forming technology aimed at making you a healthier you. They‚Äôre evolving from nice-to-have tech gadgets for geeks into life-saving tools for ourselves and the people we love.
The evolution of Apple Watch has been so gradual that most of us haven‚Äôt even realized what‚Äôs happening. Beating the entire Swiss watch industry in their own game is no small feat. But that‚Äôs exactly what Apple did.
And by making their watch the first commercially available mass-produced end-consumer electrocardiogram, we can expect a lot of exciting new developments in this space.
Wristwatches have always been an extension of our bodies. With smartwatches becoming more powerful, and technology effectively merging with our bodies, we‚Äôre at the forefront of a new era of computing.
Today, technology is not just used, but worn. This augmentation of our senses is paving the way for new types of experiences that simply haven‚Äôt been possible before. And whereas the Apple Watch might be the biggest upset in the watch industry since the Quartz revolution, the history of watches has taught us that past successes are remarkably poor predictors of the future.
My grandfather Peter Werner Jenny, who invented the first 1000m Swiss dive watch, would have followed recent upheavals in the industry with great interest. So do I. And I can‚Äôt wait to see where it‚Äôs taking us next.

LuuuFan|540|5|https://uxplanet.org/3-valuable-lessons-from-my-first-ux-design-internship-2489ab31b9cb?source=---------0---------------------|3 Valuable Lessons From My First UX Design Internship|"I first heard the word UX design a year and a month ago. I decided to see it as my career 7 months ago. I got my first intern job as a UX designer at Alibaba, one of the largest Chinese e-commerce companies, 4 months ago.
I am largely a self-taught UX designer. As soon as I commenced my first internship, I was bemused to see everything in the real ‚Äòcorporate‚Äô world being so different from what I had learned in the classroom.
Alibaba is a perfect playground for a UX newbie to explore how user experience design is implemented in the real industry. At Alibaba, I was able to experience various kinds of projects I desired. Special thanks to my leader who went out of her way to make sure me getting the most out of the internship. I put down every single thing I came across, reflected, learned and thought with during the 3-month internship.
Looking back, here are the three most valuable lessons I have learned, which makes me think differently than I did as a rookie. If you come from a non-academic background in UX design like me, these will help you better land at your first job.
I learnt it from the first project I participated in. The task was a small improvement of the sign-out process on a video sharing mobile app. I was told that the goal is to reduce the sign-out rate by reminding users of the membership benefits.
Yeah, cool! It is not a difficult task that I already have a rough idea. And there was even an existing measurement of my work! I was so excited about starting my first real project. I dived into it immediately and hammered out the solutions even one day early.
When I presented my solution to my supervisor, confidently, she asked me some questions:
It was the first and foremost mistake I came across. Fortunately, it happened so early.
The problem you are working on never happens in isolation. It is associated with business metrics, stakeholders‚Äô concerns, users‚Äô needs, the budget, the timeline, and so on. Unlike unfettered art, design is to solve problems within those constraints. So put your eyes on the context, make sure you have a comprehensive understanding of the task before starting work on it.
I have never thought thorough the tiny details when doing my coursework. However, in the same case as above, I was asked this several times by my supervisor and teammates.
Most of the time, I had solid reason behind a choice ‚Äî I chose red color because it means warning and we need to highlight it in this scenario. But other times, I just followed my intuition ‚Äî I just ran with the idea that comes to mind.
Never let tuition back up your decision. I think the white background just looks weird while the semitransparent one looks better. It is a perceptual feeling other than rational reason. For most cases, the tiny difference leads to quite another experience.
Design is not about how the interface looks. There must be a reason behind the weird looking. Go figure out what on the earth went wrong. In this case, here are some possibilities: the white background makes the content stand out, which does not match the information hierarchy; It violates the style guide of the site/app; etc.
I am not saying that looking good is not important. Actually, people react to aesthetics. But always remember that UX design cares more about the functionality good than the product looking good.
When I started my internship, I invested 80% of my time up front designing the perfect experience and improving my deliverables.
I was overwhelmed and frustrated when I presented my design to the whole team for the first time. The team consisted of product manager, marketer and engineers. It seems like everyone, as a potential user, had their own opinion towards the product.
We cannot do all of them in a month, could you prioritize them for us?
Fortunately, I worked with a bunch of professional, talented and experienced designers for two months. A valuable lesson I learnt from them is how to represent users and negotiate with other roles.
Senior designers prepared the potential questions beforehand according to who Is going to attend the meeting. Marketers may be overly concerned about the logo not being present on every page, whereas engineers may care more about whether it is really necessary to make the function so complicated.
More importantly, Senior designers‚Äô design process is never a lonely fight. They communicate with the stakeholders at an early stage during the design process to understand the technical constraints, test rough design or look for general feedback. When the team feels fully involved, the design becomes communal.
I was so fortunate to have the opportunity to meet and work with such a wonderful, supportive and friendly team. Alibaba is the perfect first station in my UX career path, where I had fun and learned a lot.

Michela Thalagala|183|6|https://blog.usejournal.com/two-years-as-a-ux-designer-taught-me-this-d9b9ab8cc236?source=---------1---------------------|Two years as a UX Designer taught me this ‚Äì Noteworthy - The Journal Blog|"It‚Äôs been 2 years since I started work as a UX Designer.
During these years I have been challenged, stressed, learnt a lot of things, met new people, had fun and most importantly fell in love with what I do. It had been a rollercoaster ride. It was a mountain to climb but the journey was sweet. Since I have reached a certain milestone, I thought of sharing ten things I‚Äôve learnt out of the many, with you.
1.It‚Äôs important to listen and to observe.
Nelson Mandela was the son of a tribal chief. And he was asked one day ‚Äúhow did you learn to be a great leader?‚Äù He responded that he would go with his father to Tribal Meeting and he remembered two things when his father would meet with other elders: They would always sit in a circle; and his father was always the last to speak.
I figured that me being the last to speak will make others feel heard. If you practice that you are not getting in their way and you can provide better input when you listen to what others have to say. And can ask better questions. It‚Äôs not only you who is going to be there in meetings, it‚Äôs teamwork and you don‚Äôt have to act like the know-it-all at all times. If you have a little bit of patience it would make everyone contribute. This helped me be more of an empathic listener.
2. The product is your baby, BUT
I was one of the core people in the product team so I have a hand in shaping the product. It definitely is my baby. And it‚Äôs important to treat it that way. Then you will constantly think of ways to improve it, you will constantly give quality work and not do the bare minimum. You will have the love and vision for it. But, it‚Äôs important to not get attached to your designs. You will be challenged, you will be asked to do another version of it when you have poured your heart and soul to that particular design. But that‚Äôs the UX designer‚Äôs life. When you are feeling down, just think that you are making this product to improve a person‚Äôs life. That way you will feel better and have the motivation and encouragement to do more.
3. Personal and professional life are two things
As UX Designers we will have to work with many people. It‚Äôs important to distinguish your professional life from your personal life. There will be disagreements when you work and some people will not be having any professionalism while working. But do not have personal grudges based on these circumstances. You may have disagreed in the previous meeting, but say hi and talk nicely when you meet face to face next time.
4. Say it out loud, rather reason out loud
When explaining a solution to the business or developers, tell the reasoning behind your conclusion. I have seen this many a times that if you tell the reasons why, they learn something out of it. Next time, they will understand you better and also can come to conclusions based on that reasoning. It will help them see in a UX point of view, now that they understand why. UX involves a lot of people because this is a collaborative effort. Great products are made when people have good ideas and think in the users‚Äô perspective.
5. Keep it formal
During these years I found that documentation helps me alot. For example, it would assist me if I note down points of a discussion. Because some stakeholders will not remember why they wanted a change or even whether there was a change. Some will not remember whether they approved a certain design verbally. Therefore it‚Äôs helpful to all the parties if you have documented the required information. It‚Äôs best to send/receive an email concluding the discussion points. If it‚Äôs a design that you need approval for, send it in email and get the formal approval.
6. Network with others
I‚Äôm part introvert, so I don‚Äôt really mind sitting in a corner, listening to music and doing my work. But that‚Äôs not always a good move. You need to connect with people, talk to them and build relationships. After all you are creating products for people. It‚Äôs great to meet new people and get to know what they are like. By networking you also improve your communication and other interpersonal skills.
7. Don‚Äôt stop learning
As designers there‚Äôs so much for us to learn, from a lot of things. Whether it‚Äôs from people, newsletters, articles, new courses, it doesn‚Äôt really matter which medium. One of the senior UX Designers I have associated with once told me, try to learn for one hour each day. I know it‚Äôs difficult with tight deadlines and stressful times. But you are doing yourself and the company a favour if you keep on learning.
8. Look at the silver linings
As a UX Designer sometimes you have to play the Business Analyst‚Äôs role as well. Or even the Project Manager‚Äôs work. But that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs all part of what‚Äôs making you into something greater. I used to complaint about it. But then realized that‚Äôs helping me out in some way. Like Steve Jobs said, ‚Äòyou can‚Äôt connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something ‚Äî your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever‚Äô
9. Know thyself
Through interactions I learn about myself. As a person I think it‚Äôs important to know who you are, what motivates you and what you want to become. And learn what are your weaknesses are strengths. For example, I am a quick learner and I can work under stress. But I am a perfectionist so I tend to not show my designs till I am satisfied with them. But I‚Äôve learnt that, it will be of no help sometimes. As agile methodology mentions, it‚Äôs best to fail early and fail often. So now I allow myself to receive feedback early.
If you know yourself, you can find ways to improve yourself.
10. Give back to the society
I‚Äôve heard this quote by Meister Eckhart, ‚ÄòIf the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough‚Äô. Giving back to the society is a way of saying thank you. I volunteer and also do UX sessions. I may not know everything, but I like to share what I know so that others can start from that point onwards. I‚Äôd like to encourage you to find ways to contribute to the society. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be the same thing that I do. The feeling you get after doing something like that is immeasurable.
I have covered 10 points here and I hope the things that I shared were of some value to you. If they were, don‚Äôt forget to give a clap ^_^

Rebeca Pravia|754|10|https://uxdesign.cc/the-best-way-to-a-great-product-is-to-focus-on-what-really-matters-37e7e06f6eca?source=---------2---------------------|The best way to a great product is to focus on what really matters|"As a UX Designer Jr. I‚Äôve learned that through the design process, besides all the research, validation, and understanding of user needs, designers are expected to comprehend the objectives of the process, collaborate with team members, and guide the product development through testing and iterations; this can be the meeting points between UX design and Product Management.
When building a new product or defining which is the following step to take in an existing one we always come up with a lot of ideas, but it is important to discern which are really important to make sure our team uses all its efforts on the most valuable features at every moment of the process.
Trying to learn more about the prioritization process I got to read ‚ÄúIntercom on Product Management‚Äù book, which explains the main lessons they‚Äôve learned through their process of designing and managing new products.
So here i‚Äôll mention the main ideas I consider should be applied when working on a new project, or making decisions about your product:
If your product already exists and your team is planning the next step, you need to evaluate its features and decide what you should do with them by analyzing how many people actually use each feature and how often.
This is called a ‚ÄúFeature audit‚Äù, it will help you map all the features you want to develop or improve, and find the core value of your product and what it is actually being used for, helping you focus on the features that really matter.
A way of carrying it out is through analytics, there are several apps that can be used to it, but it can also be done manually considering user interviews or testings.
For those features with low adoption you have 4 options:
When the product doesn‚Äôt exist, I consider the feature audit can be used to evaluate the importance of a necessity or requirement according to the frequency of usage by the users.
Kaizen is a philosophy about making continuous improvements, without generating drastic changes. With this in mind you can improve existing features before consider adding new ones, and continuously improve your product.
So if you decided to gave a feature a second chance you have 3 options.
You can make Deliberate improvements when you know WHY the customers use certain features, you know that all customers use and like the feature, and you are looking to make it better for them by adding value to it. Since making these changes implies improving well-adopted features it generates a high risk, so it‚Äôs very important to get it right.
Frequency improvements are used when you want a feature to be used more often because you think it will be beneficial for users. A way of getting these ‚Äúendorsement‚Äù is through the hook pattern defined by Nir Eyal.
You may use Adoption improvements to ease the usage or resolve issues that keep customers from using certain features you consider important.
A good way of defining the reason behind the low adoption of a feature is to constantly ask ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù; ‚Äúwhy no one uses ‚Äòx‚Äô feature?, why no one sees the value?, why is the UI confusing? why are there so many bugs?‚Äù... and go on wondering why to every answer until you get to the root cause of the real problem.
I‚Äôve been talking about making a product better by improving its existing features, now I‚Äôll talk about what to keep in mind when introducing new features to a product.
You need to consider the benefits adding a new feature will bring to your product, prioritize the necessities, and give a thought on how to introduce them.
Where do we suck? Where does it matter? The focus should be on the disappointing but important features to customers, so you‚Äôll not end up working on features no one cares. A method proposed to determine what should be taken into consideration is to learn about where the opportunity lies?, by rating how important is a task and the current level of satisfaction.
One of the perks of using this formula is that features that you normally wouldn‚Äôt notice, stand out.
Here is a list of the main question I consider important to ask when building a new feature:
Some examples of ‚ÄúQuick wins‚Äù could be: - rewrite the app copy to make it more personal, funny, precise or useful. - add keyboard shortcuts to let power users be more productive on the main screen. - remember the last active project and bring the user back there when they next login. - provide extra information and links to actions in email notifications.
At Intercom, they add features following a series of steps using ‚ÄúFeature flags‚Äù, which is a technique that allows to progressively expose and validate new features and receive feedback, before making it public. Said method has 5 steps:
And you are looking for:
4. Full roll out: features are available to all users. Is important to show the users what they can do.
5. Message schedule for the feature: encourage people to use the feature. Focus on growing the usage of your product, instead of the growth of the product.
1. Make a strong first impressionMake the features discoverable, show your users how they work and motivate them to get started. A way of making this good impression could be by communicating with the users, letting them know how to get help, with tutorials, welcome messages
2. Gradually expose the depth of your product. Not all features are useful at first, and showing them from time to time by scheduling messages/notifications to show them when using the product is a good way of promoting.
3. Announce features and improvements in-app.Similar to previous, users are only interested on features when using the tool.
4. Show the users what they CAN DO, and not what you did, or what it does. The message impact and user interest in the features increases when you show them what they can do or achieve now.
As far i‚Äôve been talking about how to improve or add new features to our products, but what about those features that we shouldn‚Äôt consider or we need to get rid off?
The reasons for including a feature should be based on substantiated arguments, and not added just because if; data looks good, it takes little time, it could be optional, there is nothing else planned, 521,000 people want it or competition have it are some non-valid arguments used to ‚Äúsneak features‚Äù into a product, but are them enough? the answer is NO.
Remember this 6 things:
When you are defining a product roadmap, while prioritizing features and necessities, you should be comfortable saying NO to a feature you consider unnecessary. In this case you can make use of the ‚ÄúFeature audit‚Äù previously explained, to identify which features have been adopted, and which features are still struggling to be endorsed, and get rid of these.
Remember, when wondering which features keep and which don‚Äôt, ask: Who use them? Who don‚Äôt? and most important Why?
After all what is more important through this defining process is to always consider people needs and their problems; when you find their motivations to use a product, you know which features to develop and when. Always try to deliver the best solution to a problem, make it the simpler way possible and make it possible for more people, in more situations.

Jeff Davidson|33K|8|https://blog.prototypr.io/the-most-important-rule-in-ux-design-that-everyone-breaks-1c1cb188931?source=---------3---------------------|The Most Important Rule in UX Design that Everyone Breaks|"There is one principle of organization that every human should adhere to, particularly people who design products. Day after day, I see companies break this rule, and it is 100% of the time to their detriment. In this article I will explain what that rule is, and what it means to product and service design. I‚Äôll also raise the possible implications of this phenomenon on organizational management, collaboration, and general performance. The psychological phenomenon I will be discussing in this article is known as Miller‚Äôs Law. Rather than just tell you what Miller‚Äôs Law is, I ask you to take part in this exercise for a more immersive learning lesson.
Read the italicized instructions before starting. Grab a pen and paper. This is an exercise where you will try to recall words you‚Äôve just read, off memory.
Below is a list of 20 words. Read them to comprehension , and try to memorize as many as possible. Try to keep the words ‚Äòin your head‚Äô. Do not write the words. Spend about a minute. After you are done reading, scroll down until you see the word ‚ÄòSTOP‚Äô. Then, read step 2.
STOP < ¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑
Now, use your pen and paper to write down as many words as you can remember from the list. Think hard, but do not scroll back up to view the words. If you scroll up, the experiment is ruined. Give yourself about half a minute...Once you have finished writing the words you tried to recall, scroll back up and check how many you got right.
If you are like the vast majority of human beings, you will have remembered 5‚Äì9 of the words. Hundreds of experiments prove universality of this limitation on memory. When I first discovered this phenomenon, I knew it had huge implications on product design, because of the degree to which this limitation affects day to day tasks. This capacity for keeping ~7 bits of information ‚Äòin the head‚Äô short term, is known as Miller‚Äôs Law.
In 1956 there was a paper written that became one of the most highly cited papers in psychology. Titled, The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information, it was published in 1956 by the cognitive psychologist George A. Miller of Princeton University‚Äôs Department of Psychology in Psychological Review. The crux of the paper suggests that the number of perceptual ‚Äòchunks‚Äô an average human can hold in working memory (a component of short-term memory) is 7 ¬± 2. This is frequently referred to as Miller‚Äôs law. Here is a summary of the article, sourced from wikipedia:
Moreover, the human mind can remember ~7 bits of information when completing a task that requires cognitive effort. This is critical, because humans are constantly performing tasks, and trying to juggle various stimuli in the mind when doing so. One of the key concepts behind Miller‚Äôs Law is ‚Äòchunking‚Äô, which basically means assembling various bits of information into a cohesive gestalt. For example, the word ¬∑ p e n c i l ¬∑ is actually a ‚Äòchunk‚Äô of letters, organized into a perceptual gestalt. If the letters were rearranged ¬∑ c n l i p e ¬∑ it would be six separate chunks of information. Chunking is a critical element of information organization, and is the basis for our UX and organizational rule.
Always organize elements of information in categories no larger than 9, but preferably ~5 chunks.
The more chunks of information you add to an ‚Äòinterface‚Äô, the more difficult it becomes to ‚Äòwork‚Äô, using the information at hand. This is especially critical for first time users, because they haven‚Äôt had the ‚Äòpractice‚Äô needed to encode the interface into long term memory, or, for the behaviour to become habitual. I constantly see this rule being broken by giants like Facebook, Google, and Wordpress. Don‚Äôt even get me started on automobile interface design. The ~5 bit chunk rule also compliments minimalism as a rigorous design philosophy. To expound, due to the limitations of working memory, as a product becomes more feature-full it inevitably becomes more difficult to use, because the user has to manage more information while operating the product. This makes good information design so critical.
Millers Law also highlights the importance of foresight and proper planning in the design process, because as you add more features to a product ‚Äî your interface must be able to accommodate those new features without breaking the visual foundation of what you built. Rebuilding a foundation takes immense time and resources.
Another perceptual phenomenon observed in relation to Miller‚Äôs Law is known as the primacy, and recency effect. These terms are used respectively to describe how we remember items sensed at the beginning and end of an experience, more than ones in the middle. For example, if I were to show you a list of words, you would more likely remember the words at the beginning of the list, and the end. This is also known as the serial position effect. From wikipedia:
This observation raises huge questions in business and design. If people remember more at the beginning and end of an experience, how do we enhance the positives, and mitigate the negatives at these respective times? When does an experience truly begin and end? Should we be organizing more important elements at the beginning and end of lists due to their increased retention? These are all valid questions that UX designers and executives should ask when inventing or developing their product.
Millers Law can be applied to any aspect of your life that involves performing a mildly complex task. By reducing the amount of elements in your reach/access ‚Äî and keeping them organized by relevant chunks not exceeding 9 bits, your brain will be able to remember exactly where things are so you can access its functionality. When lists of items grow too large, they become very difficult to mentally map them, requiring the user to do more cumbersome searching.
The adherence to Miller‚Äôs Law is especially relevant in the light of lean methodologies and recent trends in tech and UX. Users want and need a trial before they purchase something ‚Äî it‚Äôs that simple. If they don‚Äôt experience the value within the first day or week of using it ‚Äî they won‚Äôt buy. Since new users do not have lengthly time to learn where everything is ‚Äî information design needs to be planned and well thought out before development happens.
We live in a world with an exponentially increasing amount of information. By not organizing it properly, or eliminating some completely, it ultimately degrades our ability to complete critical tasks for the purposes of survival (navigation/gaining income). That is why it‚Äôs so useful to omit items, products, and services from your life that aren‚Äôt giving a quality return on investment. This falls in line with the Pareto principle, the idea that 80% of your outcomes comes from 20% of your investments. Are you juggling too many tasks per day to be efficient? Is your team using too many tools to collaborate? Do you have too many members on your team? Are you overloading your new employees with information, leading to confusion?
Millers law teaches us that humans have a finite amount of information they can process, and that information overload will lead to distraction that negatively affects performance. Companies should look for ways to organize information in a way that is much more digestible for their customers and employees. This could be by eliminating tools or applications that are producing cognitive overload, reducing the amount of members on a team, or even organizing your departments based on our knowledge of working memory.
This is especially true in new science of the concept of flow, made famous by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is a word Mihaly coined to describe a state of concentration or ‚Äòabsorption‚Äô with a specific task that humans ultimately find rewarding, pleasurable, and fulfilling. He describes it as an optimal state where we perform at our best and truly live ‚Äòin the moment‚Äô. One sure way to kill flow is by increasing distractions in the workplace. So, do you think that by giving your employees more tools, that it actually enhances performance? Miller‚Äôs Law teaches us time and time again this is not the case. When it comes to completing tasks, less is more.
Turn off your desktop slack notifications. Get rid of the things you never use. Stop checking your various inboxes. Master one tool, not many. Now start focusing.

Witnessing the process of mental deterioration can be tragic for seniors, family members, and caregivers.
Consequently, our team of student designers set out to design a web solution to help the families of those suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs/ Dementia.
I worked with fellow designers Sara Hathaway, TJ Egbert, and Uliti Fangupo.
Our team followed the 5 Planes of User Experience popularized by Jesse James Garrett.
We defined the strategy and scope as a team, and then separated and designed the structure, skeleton, and surface individually.
Our prompt was pretty broad, so first we set out to answer a handful of important questions:
A Facebook group called Memory People serves as a helpful resource for family members to share their struggles and ask for advice. I was admitted to the group and would read posts daily.
As I read about people‚Äôs tragedies caring for their loved ones, I was impressed with their patience and love. The posts helped us better understand what family members were going through. In becoming a part of this community we learned an important piece of terminology as well ‚Äî Alzheimer‚Äôs and Dementia patients are referred to as loved ones.
We distributed a survey and conducted contextual interviews in order to understand the landscape better.
The following responses illustrate the results of our research.
What is most difficult for you as you care for your loved one?
What do you enjoy about caring for your loved one?
Does anything seem to improve the emotional state of your loved one?
One man we interviewed, Don, was diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs seven years ago. Upon first learning of the diagnoses, Don thought that his life was going to be awful.
However, Don shared that immediately after that thought passed through his mind, a second thought followed. He shared his story with us,
Don explained that he and his family are closer than they‚Äôve ever been. Don‚Äôs gratitude exemplified a principle that came through in our survey results as well ‚Äî gratitude for cherished relationships is often the best medicine.
Alzheimer‚Äôs patients repeat phrases over and over again. One phrase that Don repeated as we talked, ‚Äúlife is really wonderful for us!‚Äù
Our research proved that trying to help with medical issues would be beyond our scope of knowledge and better handled by medical professionals.
Consequently, we decided to focus on helping family members with the emotional difficulties associated with caring for someone with the disease.
We created a persona named Sandy. Sandy cares for her mom who has Alzheimer‚Äôs, and she is struggling to deal with the emotional toll brought on by the disease.
User story mapping was helpful in developing solutions that would provide the emotional support Sandy needed.
However, we realized that we should have tightened the scope of our product more before discussing features. The product was shaping up to address too many jobs in Sandy‚Äôs life. We knew that we wanted to address emotional needs, but we had to define the best way to do it.
As our group split up and started working on individual designs, I felt like I wasn‚Äôt ready to begin wireframing. I still hadn‚Äôt found the heart of the problem.
I went over our data again, trying to figure out what the focus should be. I eventually had the epiphany (and it manifested itself as a fever dream in my notebook).
The user story was this: family members consume a story, which prompts memories and inspires gratitude for their loved one.
I then realized that there was a second component to the user story. Our family members received the most satisfaction when they did two things:
Therefore, to provide lasting value to family members, my product had to turn the stories -> memories -> gratitude process into a cycle. For it to be truly helpful the user story needed to be:
Once I had figured out the user story, I set out to design a site with the following features:
It was important to give family members the ability to share memories with others, but this presented a handful of problems.
There were a number of ways that I could approach the sharing mechanics, depending on different variations of the user story. I considered the following options:
The easiest way, but obviously extremely flawed. Many older family members are very private on the internet so this didn‚Äôt make sense.
Similar to Facebook or Instagram, this feature required family members to build a network to share with. I was afraid that this may make it feel too much like a social media site.
This is what I ended up implementing in my user flow. Family members can create groups and then share to groups. Groups can be made public or private, depending on the user‚Äôs preferences. The idea was that public groups would be seen by others and would promote collaboration, while private groups would be invite-only and would maintain privacy.
I started exploring a layout for the site with wireframes.
The first prototype included a couple key features
I tested my prototype with a handful of individuals in their 50‚Äôs. A flood of feedback forced me to reevaluate a handful of my assumptions.
In an effort to listen to the family members, I made the following updates to my design,
As soon as family members enter the site, they compose and upload a memory, ensuring their first interactions with the app provide a worthwhile experience.
Family members can make a memory as detailed or as simple as they want. The memory composition page is inviting and powerful.
Contextual organization tools make it easy for individuals to learn their loved one‚Äôs life story.
To discover their loved one‚Äôs stories, individuals don‚Äôt have to learn any new habits, they simply check their email.
In designing Living Memories, I was humbled by the difficulties that family members face as their loved ones struggle with Alzheimer‚Äôs/ Dementia. Consequently, I designed something that could help them remember the good as they endure the bad. As I presented the final prototype to my testers and others, one bit of feedback proved that my commitment to understanding the family members paid off,

Have you ever wondered, why or how you make this association just by looking at a fluffy, blob of gas? It‚Äôs all because of how your brain works!
Your brain is always trying to make sense of the world by comparing previous experiences or visual patterns and connecting the dots. It has its own ‚Äúweird‚Äù way of perceiving shape and form, grouping information, fill in the gaps to draw the big picture.
Having an understanding how your brain works will help you become a wiser designer; master manipulator of Visual Communication. It can help you determine which visual elements are most effective in any given situation, so you can use them to influence perception, direct attention and cause behavioural change. Something particularly useful when it comes to goal-oriented, problem-solving, intuitive design; User Interface design.
It‚Äôs clear by now, visual design and psychology are linked and can influence one another. Gestalt principles can help us understand and control these links.
Gestalt (form, shape in German) is a group of visual perception principles developed by German psychologists in 1920s. It is built on the theory that ‚Äúan organized whole, is perceived as greater than the sum of its parts‚Äù.
The Gestalt principles attempt to describe how people perceive visual elements when certain conditions apply. They are built on four key ideas:
People tend to identify elements first in their general outlined form. Our brain recognises a simple, well-defined object quicker than a detailed one.
People can recognise objects even when there are parts of them missing. Our brain matches what we see with familiar patterns stored in our memory and fills in the gaps.
People will often interpret ambiguous objects in more than one ways. Our brains will bounce back and forth between the alternatives seeking certainty. As a result, one view will become more dominant while the other one will get harder to see.
People can recognise simple objects independently of their rotation, scale and translation. Our brain can perceive objects from different perspectives, despite their different appearance.
Here‚Äôre the Gestalt principles which can inform today‚Äôs UI design.
Elements arranged close to each other are perceived as more related than those placed further apart. This way different elements are viewed mainly as a group rather than as individual elements.
We can use the Proximity principle in UI design for grouping similar information, organising content and decluttering layouts. Its correct use will have a positive impact on visual communication and user experience.
As the principle states, items that are related should stay close to each other, while the unrelated items should stay further apart. White space plays a vital role here as it creates contrast guiding the users‚Äô eyes in the intended direction. White space can boost visual hierarchy and information flow, contributing in easy to read and scan layouts. It will help users achieve their goals faster and delve deeper into the content.
We can apply the Proximity principle pretty much everywhere from navigation, cards, galleries and banners to lists, body text and pagination.
Similarly to the Proximity principle, elements placed within the same region are perceived as grouped.
The Common Region principle is particularly useful. It can help with information grouping and content organisation, but it can also achieve content separation or act as a focal point. It boosts hierarchy, scanability and assists in promoting information.
The Common Region principle can hold together many different elements keeping them unified within larger groups. We can achieve it with the use of line, colour, shape and shadow. It can often be used to bring elements into the foreground, indicating interaction or importance.
A good Common Region example would be the card UI pattern; a well defined rectangular space with different bits of information presented as one. Banners and tables are good examples as well.
Elements sharing similar visual characteristics are perceived to be more related than those not sharing similar characteristics.
We tend to perceive similar to each other elements as grouped or a pattern. We also might think that they serve the same purpose. Similarity can help us with organising and classifying objects within a group and linking them with a specific meaning or function.
There are different ways of making elements perceived as being similar, and thus, related. These include similarity of colour, size, shape, texture, dimension, and orientation; with some of them being more strongly communicative than others (ex. colour > size > shape). When Similarity occurs, an object can get emphasised by being different from the rest; this is called ‚ÄòAnomaly‚Äô and can be used to create contrast or visual weight. It can draw the user‚Äôs attention to a specific piece of content (focal point) while assisting with scanability, discoverability and the overall flow.
We can use the principle of Similarity in navigation, links, buttons, headings, call to actions and more.
A group of elements are often perceived to be a single recognisable form or figure. The Closure also occurs when an object is incomplete, or parts of it are not enclosed.
As the Closure principle states, when presented with the right amount of information, our brain will jump to conclusions by filling in the gaps and creating a unified whole. This way we can decrease the number of elements needed to communicate information, reducing complexity and making designs more engaging. Closure can help us minimise visual noise and convey a message, reinforcing a concept within a pretty small space.
We can use the Closure principle in Iconography, where simplicity helps with communicating meaning, swiftly and clearly.
Symmetrical elements tend to perceived as belonging together regardless of their distance, giving us a feeling of solidity and order.
Symmetrical elements are simple, harmonious and visually pleasing. Our eyes seek those attributes along with order and stability, to make sense of the world. For this reason, Symmetry is a useful tool for communicating information quickly and efficiently. Symmetry feels comfortable helping us focus on what‚Äôs important.
Symmetrical compositions are satisfying, but they can also get a bit dull and static. Visual symmetry tends to be more dynamic, and interesting. Adding an asymmetrical element to an otherwise symmetrical design can help with drawing attention while making an impression; something useful for any point of interest or a Call To Action, for example. Symmetry, along with a healthy amount of asymmetry is important in any design.
It‚Äôs good to use Symmetry for portfolios, galleries, product displays, listings, navigation, banners, and any content-heavy page.
Elements arranged in a line or a soft curve are perceived to be more related than those arranged randomly or in a harsh line.
Elements following a continuous line are perceived as grouped. The smoother the line segments, the more we see them as a unified shape; our mind prefers the path of least resistance.
Continuity helps us interpret direction and movement through a composition. It takes place when aligning elements and it can help our eyes move smoothly through the page, assisting with legibility. The Continuity principle strengthens the perception of grouped information, creating order and guiding users through different content segments. Disruption of continuity can signal the end of a section drawing attention to a new piece of content.
The linear arrangement of rows and columns are good examples of Continuity. We can use them in menus and sub-menus, lists, product arrangements, carousels, services or process/progress displays.
Elements moving towards the same direction are perceived as more related than those moving in different directions, or not moving at all.
Regardless of how far apart are the elements or how dissimilar they might appear, if they are moving or changing together, they are perceived as related. This effect can take place even when movement is implied, by other visual elements.
The Common Fate principle is more potent when elements move synchronised; in the same direction and at the same time and speed. It can help with grouping relevant information and linking actions with results. The disruption of a synchronised movement can grab users‚Äô attention and direct it to a specific element or feature. It can also, establish relationships between different groups or states.
We can use the Common Fate principle in expandable menus, accordions, tool-tips, product sliders, parallax scrolls and swiping indicators.
User Interface Design isn‚Äôt all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It‚Äôs mainly about communication, performance and convenience. Gestalt principles are always current helping us achieve these goals; creating a pleasant experience for the users and a great success for the business.

Roman Kamushken|76|4|https://medium.com/@kamushken/how-to-create-responsive-mobile-components-in-figma-1661189d1503?source=---------6---------------------|How to create responsive mobile components in Figma.|"Every time you create a new product, you want to make it better than the previous one. You want to choose a more elegant solution, to create convenient and flexible components of the design system in Figma.
When creating the next design product, I decided to experiment with the Tab Bar component. I`d like to remind you that it is the bottom navigation in the iOS guidelines. I wanted its contents to have a logical and optimal behavior at resizing. I wanted to make it as adaptive as possible for all mobile iOS devices, as far as Figma and constraints allow to make it.
Tab Bar is a set of icons with or without inscriptions, leading to the appropriate section of the application when pressed. The active section is always highlighted. Guidelines recommend to use from 3 to 5 sections inside applications using Tab Bar as the main navigation control.
No tool for interface design allows the full adaptivity so far. Figma is no exception, it uses the classic Constraints approach, but even with it you can do a lot. For example, you can see the perfect and actually adaptive behavior of the Tab Bar on all devices in the animation below:
A good design system in Figma necessarily contains an icons library. At least the main system ones. This eliminates the need to import them manually from SVG files every time. Constraints in the Scale mode should be for each icon component, from which you will make a convenient library over time. Then you will get a flexible icon that can be used in any dimensions: 16x16, and 44x44, and so on. Most likely you will throw such an icon through Figma`s left panel inside the Tab Bar and add an inscription when you start creating a component. And the problem is that with such constraints the icon will always be squeezed inside the Tab Bar at resizing if you want to get an adaptive component:
I suggested above that within your design system, all the component icons are in the Scale mode, it means when you create the Tab Bar, you can immediately break the connection with them and assign each icon individual Center constraints. It, in turn, will remain in the frame, which you need to assign the Scale mode.
This method may be suitable if there are not so many icons in the project. Just duplicate your entire Scale set, detach, change constraints to Center, re-create the components and submit to a new page with a different name. Recently, I think it‚Äôs a good idea that several hundred icons in any Figma system can be stored both as Scaleable and as Centered. So, once you dropped a Tab Bar onto your canvas, you just need to swap the icons and you can keep it as the Instance in your project.
According to the concept of Atomic design, such a component will be considered a molecule. Pack an icon and an inscription in it, then feel free to put Center constraints to both and put the Scale mode for the molecule itself. After that, put them in your Tab Bar. Thus icon constraints will be ignored and no squeeze happening anymore. In addition, the icon with the inscription is an effective navigation pattern. So why not reuse this component somewhere else in the project?
Personally I use Method 3. I think it is more elegant and professional. Maybe you have your own methods? Write in the comments üì£ ...
By the way, many components in the Figma iOS toolkit are made according to this method. I recommend you to pay attention if you are prototyping mobile interfaces in Figma
Happy prototyping!

Needless to say, it was boring-looking, tedious and required users to remember a lot of different commands to complete tasks. Three years later, everything changed when Apple released its highly successful Macintosh; a computer that popularised the use of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) on personal computers. It was revolutionary, with some even arguing that it was almost as huge as the moon landing, spearheading a paradigm shift in the way users would interact with their PCs for decades to come. Users would use their PCs not just because they had to, but because they wanted to.
When GUIs first became a staple on PCs, there were several considerations put into the way it was presented. Many users were new to the concept of personal computers and the learning curve was extremely steep. The GUI was seen as one of the main catalysts that led to the exponential rise in people who owned and used PCs after the 1980s. It was made to simplify the way users navigate around the functions of their computers, drawing references to familiar, real-life objects or visual representations that aided users in their understanding of how things worked in an unfamiliar environment.
With technology rapidly advancing after the widespread implantation of GUIs across many personal devices, displays got better. Graphic processing got better. The push for better-looking, professional and more eye-catching visuals became the next big thing for manufacturers and developers to parade their technological prowess. The rise of touch screens also meant that users now had to transition to new means of interacting with their devices, pushing for developers to implement visual languages that would ease this transition. GUIs started drawing even more real references to real-life objects and textures, because they could. This type of design was known as skeuomorphism.
Things started getting really detailed in the graphics department of interface design in the early 2000s. The visual upgrades of Mac OS X, Windows XP and even the launch of the first iPhone, heralded a phase in interface design where things like icons were being designed with the aim of being as realistic as possible. There were leather textures, glass surfaces and shiny brushed aluminium finishes that seemed to wrap around every single icon on every user interface from PCs to phones. There were reflections, gradients and shadows that made things ‚Äúpop‚Äù more.
It seemed as though the better displays and processing power got, the more inclined we were to mimic reality in our digital realms, in an attempt to ‚Äúpush our technological boundaries‚Äù. It was an exciting period for interface design! People were impressed at how realistic something on a digital screen could appear. It seemed so cool! You could flip pages on iBooks the same way you could on regular books. It seemed so futuristic, the way PC programs were encased in clean, reflective glass and metal.
After a few years though, we started to feel bored. If all digital spaces mimicked the way things looked like in reality, there was not much visual stimulation for the user. In fact, things started looking cluttered to us. That changed when the idea of Flat Design came out. Simple, clean, uncluttered buttons, no textures or reflective surfaces, no glass, no leather. Skeuomorphism, in all it‚Äôs textured, shadowed glory, started becoming an eyesore of the past. It was the right time to transition too. Touch-based interfaces had been in the market for a while by then and computers had been around for several decades. Users were already used to the way things worked and had little need for real life references to aid in their understanding of how things functioned.
Flat, minimalist design was suddenly everywhere. From interfaces to company logos, designers hopped on the trend like it was a new drug, fuelling a new wave of minimalism that permeated every facet of graphic design, one that focused on delivering eye-catching graphics with bright colours and a minimum amount of detail. In the context of interface design, it was all about providing a streamlined, fuss-free user experience, even within a complex system of functions. Users could get straight to what they wanted with straightforward gestures and interactions that prioritised information by importance, without the need to tie them down to positions relative to one another as they would be in real life.
Flat designs also meant that applications took less time to load as interfaces became less graphic-intensive. They helped create an experience that was smoother and one of the best examples was Windows Phone OS and its ‚Äúmetro design‚Äù concept. Despite being a very half-baked OS with limited functionality and app support that eventually led to its demise, its native functions and applications ran buttery smooth and was overall rather aesthetically pleasing.
Design trends come and go. Skeuomorphic design and flat design are no exception. Looking forward into the next few decades of technology, many predictions have been made regarding how future interfaces might look like. There is no shortage of interface design concepts as people are constantly trying to imagine the possibilities. The world of Science Fiction has provided a great platform for people to express their ideas and fantasies too!
In today‚Äôs context, flat design has hit its peak in terms of its ubiquity in interface design and designers have already started experimenting with how visuals can be made more appealing beyond sticking to just minimalism. Microsoft‚Äôs Fluent Design system is one example of a large tech company taking the lead in the next step of interface design. It combines what we love and what was helpful from skeuomorphic design with elements from minimalism.
Considerations have also been made to cater to interfaces of the future. Virtual Reality (VR) interfaces have the dimension of 3D space that factors into the way the interface is designed. Making use of photography to complement visuals and graphics on applications can create more immersive experiences with a more human touch. Skeuomorphism can play a very important role here, once again, by helping users transition into and adapt to new digital environments. In a way, interface designers can use skeuomorphism as a tool that adapts to theirs and the users‚Äô needs.
Skeuomorphism does not just apply to visuals as well. There are many other ways interfaces connect with our human sense through the use or skeuomorphism and one way is through the use of skeuomorphic audio. But that may very well be another topic for today. If you are interested, I have found a really cool article regarding the use of audio skeuomorphism here.

Shane Ketterman|158|5|https://uxdesign.cc/why-are-micro-experiences-so-important-to-ux-design-a4292d5ded53?source=---------8---------------------|Why are Micro-Experiences so important to UX Design?|"We have all heard the phrase, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Sweat The Small Stuff‚Äù. It‚Äôs a common way of letting people know to shrug off the little things and instead, worry about the bigger, more important things.
Great advice. Except when it comes to UX Design. This is when we absolutely have to sweat the small stuff. In this case, the small stuff I‚Äôm referring to are micro-experiences: The little things that happen before, during, and after a user engages with a product, website, app, or service.
We want to think of micro-experiences in terms of user engagement, and user engagement is a large part of Human-Centered Design. To read about Human Centered Design, here is a great article from Miklos Philips over on the Toptal UX Design Blog.
Human engagement is concerned with the entire experience a person has with our product. This means we focus on questions such as:
These questions can be detailed nuances that are really easy to be glossed over when handling multiple projects, wireframing, user research, information architecture, etc.
Human engagement, however, is all about the small stuff. It‚Äôs about the tiny, little things that we experience every day and never really stop to think about until it strikes us as, ‚ÄúWow, that sure was easy!‚Äù, or ‚ÄúHow cool that they thought of that!‚Äù.
We know that human engagement is critical to UX Design success and we know that total engagement is a summation of all the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù things that take place. So what are these small things?
Say hello to micro-experiences. A few examples:
None of these examples are earth-shaking or unheard of. We know them. We have experienced them. The challenge, as UX Designers, is that we aren‚Äôt always thinking of sweating the small stuff and it‚Äôs just a natural human trait to get caught up in other parts of the design process and then focus on our finish line.
We can introduce micro-experiences in a number of ways. One way that comes to mind is including a micro-experience process as a part of the UX Design strategy.
It could be a checklist or set of guidelines that comes into the picture after user research and after sketches and mockups and iteration. If we are working in a Lean UX environment then it needs to be a part of every sprint that takes place beyond user research.
What would these guidelines look like? Here‚Äôs a stab at how they might appear in a traditional UX project:
Note that a lot of these proposed guidelines are questions and they are focused on scrutinizing the small things that are hard to notice at first, but this is why ‚Äúmicro‚Äù is so important. They are hardly noticeable yet some of the most important things that make a user experience complete and successful.
Everything we deal with in the world of humans/users and experiences changes on a daily basis. Sure, there are some tried and true psychology and heuristic principles, there are even rules for how to deal with text, graphics, fonts, colors, etc.
So we might pose the question: If there are so many rules already written, then why not just follow those and be done?
The answer is that we are designing for users, and rules are just guidelines because users (you and me included) aren‚Äôt always predictable. In fact, we are only really predictable and being unpredictable.
What we do know, however, is that we can design for a target audience. We can design for an experience with that target audience and we can continually measure outcomes of that experience. We also know that a true successful experience isn‚Äôt one single thing that occurs, it‚Äôs a culmination of many little things and those are what users really remember.
The moral of this story is to sweat the small stuff in UX Design. By doing this, we focus on micro-experiences and turn the ordinary into extraordinary; which by all respects gives our fellow humans a memorable journey with even the most mundane of products. When we can achieve that, then we all win.
How would you come up with a set of micro-experience guidelines? What would your list look like?

Gracias a la segunda pregunta nace Popakorn. ¬øEn queÃÅ consiste? imagina que a pesar de estar suscrito a varias plataformas de video, nunca sabes queÃÅ ver, ademaÃÅs las recomendaciones que te proporcionan estas plataformas nunca se asemejan de verdad con tus gustos. No te preocupes porque no estaÃÅs solo, es un problema muy comuÃÅn.
Antes de tener la idea, necesitamos tener un problema que resolver, ¬øcuaÃÅl fue el problema que yo encontreÃÅ? La gente no sabe que ver ni doÃÅnde verlo.
Para llegar del problema a la solucioÃÅn aplicamos el Design Thinking.
El design thinking un meÃÅtodo para generar ideas innovadoras que centra su eficacia en entender y dar solucioÃÅn a las necesidades reales de los usuarios.
Algo que siempre tenemos que tener en cuenta y es que: tuÃÅ no eres tu usuario, ¬øqueÃÅ significa esto? significa que no puedes disenÃÉar, idear o iterar seguÃÅn tus gustos o propio criterio, sino que siempre hay que tener en cuenta al usuario real. Para eso creamos el user persona, para poder tener en cuenta al usuario en todo momento.
DespueÃÅs del proceso de UX, tenemos claras las funcionalidades que va a tener nuestra plataforma y en queÃÅ dispositivo la vamos a desarrollar.
Los datos me dieron como resultado que tenia que ser multiplataforma. Al ser un proyecto que realizamos en tan solo 2 semanas desde 0, desarrolleÃÅ el disenÃÉo de una uÃÅnica plataforma; aplicacioÃÅn de escritorio enfocada a Mac Os.
En la parte de disenÃÉo y prototipado seguimos aplicando el Design Thinking.
Empezamos con un moodboard para obtener colores, tipografiÃÅas, estilos para el logo, nombre, y un largo etc.
Empezamos el proceso de prototipado con un disenÃÉo en low fidelity, que testeamos para ver si vamos por buen camino con el disenÃÉo. DespueÃÅs del low, viene el mid fidelity que se realiza en Sketch, volvemos a testearlo y ademaÃÅs con el mid fidelity podemos ver si estaÃÅ bien hecho el user flow.
Una vez lo tenemos todo terminado y testeado, empezamos con el high fidelity donde ya ponemos colores y sombras.
Al terminar el disenÃÉo por completo, pasamos a flinto donde realizaremos una serie de animaciones para ver coÃÅmo quedariÃÅa nuestro producto final.
En primer lugar podemos tener varios usuarios con una misma cuenta.
Podemos seleccionar tantas plataformas como queramos de las que estemos suscritos.
TambieÃÅn podemos seleccionar nuestros geÃÅneros favoritos y asiÃÅ podraÃÅ recomendarnos contenido seguÃÅn nuestros gustos.
En la paÃÅgina principal tenemos el contenido audiovisual que nos recomienda seguÃÅn los gustos que hemos puesto y las plataformas de las que somos socios, seguÃÅn vayamos visualizando contenido iraÃÅ aprendiendo para recomendarnos contenido maÃÅs personalizado.
TambieÃÅn podemos anÃÉadir amigos (tantos como tengamos) y seguir las listas que ellos crean.
Las listas son como su nombre indica, una lista con contenido audiovisual que tenemos que tener en un mismo sitio, ej: maratoÃÅn de Disney, pues creariÃÅamos una lista con todas las peliÃÅculas de Disney. Podemos tanto seguir la de amigos como crear las nuestras propias.
¬øAlguna vez has quedado con alguien y habeÃÅis tenido problemas a la hora de elegir queÃÅ ver? Cada uno tiene sus gustos y ha visto unas cosas. Para eso creeÃÅ la feature de Fiesta, ¬øcoÃÅmo funciona? te genera contenido aleatorio seguÃÅn las personas que esteÃÅn en el grupo.
Al igual que la feature de fiesta, tambieÃÅn estaÃÅ la opcioÃÅn de que te recomiende contenido seguÃÅn tus propios gustos.
TrabajeÃÅ junto al bootcamp de web de Ironhack, yo proporcioneÃÅ la parte de UX/UI del proyecto y ellos la parte de programacioÃÅn, ademaÃÅs quedamos finalistas en el hackshow que es un evento que se hace al final de los bootcamps donde se seleccionan los mejores proyectos entre todos los alumnos, fue un gran honor que nuestro proyecto estuviera entre los seleccionados.

Bit Finer|1|2|https://medium.com/@bitfiner/bit-finer-is-nominated-on-german-design-award-2019-with-2-ux-ui-projects-7b2bfebabbc7?source=---------4---------------------|Bit Finer is nominated on German Design Award 2019 with 2 UX/UI projects|"Unreal! Here it is, nr. 5! Bit Finer is glad to announce to be nominated on German Design Awards 2019 which is one of the biggest recognitions in the world of digital design. This is the fifth sky-high recognition for our UX/UI design project KAFO which has already won 3 awards :)
And a similar story with the project of Tavex which has won 2 awards and now is nominated to receive the third one. Let‚Äôs hope for the best.
So in total 2 projects have brought us 8 high recognitions in the world of digital design. 8 is a magical number indeed!
See how 46 design specialists from 11 countries spent 2 days in Frankfurt to evaluate unique designs from the video below.
Thank you is not enough!
But still we want to thank KAFO & Tavex Group for being the best possible partners. The word client would be too modest. And of course the team from Bit Finer, Mihkel Raud from Uwaga, development partners and especially the designers who made it happen: Lauri and Mathias.
Current high recognitions and awards
Want to learn more about KAFO or Tavex design projects? We have written quite modest stories about them.
In case you wonder who or what on earth is Bit Finer here‚Äôs something we made recently.
Cheers!
Bit Finer is a results-orientated UX/UI design studio with a simple goal - to grow your business and make it more profitable.

Jason Clau√ü - UX Renegade|8|7|https://uxplanet.org/youtube-isnt-altering-your-comments-yet-ca7cf2ef22db?source=---------6---------------------|YouTube isn‚Äôt altering your comments... yet. ‚Äì UX Planet|"So states Hanlon‚Äôs Razor:
We‚Äôd all do well to keep that truism in mind when considering the following scenario. This video was published on YouTube on October 21st, claiming that YouTube was altering user comments in real time.
The implications of this video are disturbing, to say the least. In the wake of this video, there was indeed a flurry of conspiracy theories, with the general gist that left-leaning tech megacorporations are experimenting with thought control techniques. It certainly didn‚Äôt help that Google has hired some rather shady characters (read: raving Marxists) in the past.
It isn‚Äôt hard to see how algorithmic comment editing could be used for evil. AI could detect a certain political position based on the content of a post, then either re-word it to tweak its meaning, or ‚Äî even scarier ‚Äî embed typos and grammatical errors to slowly discredit anyone who holds a specific view. Perhaps the incident in this video is just an early AI misstep.
Or perhaps it was all a misunderstanding. Which it was.
As it turns out, the actual explanation for what happened in that video is a lot less sinister... but it should be just as interesting if you are a UX designer.
Perhaps you noticed when the guy said:
That‚Äôs because it was Google Translate. Let me explain a few things.
First, the translation gaffe here most likely involved Russian. Because Russian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, and because English speakers probably don‚Äôt want to bother typing Cyrillic characters, Translate attempts to transliterate Latin approximations of Russian words into Cyrillic. For instance, ‚Äú–¥–æ —Å–≤–∏–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è‚Äù (Russian for ‚Äúgood bye‚Äù) would be most accurately transliterated as ‚Äúdo svidaniya‚Äù, however many people might misspell the first word as ‚Äúda‚Äù. Translate will attempt to factor in that error, and creatively interpret the text based on what it thinks the user meant.
Second, Google Translate has the ability to translate a whole page from a foreign language to whichever language you choose. That can be very useful but only when the user is aware that it is happening. Unfortunately, Translate‚Äôs ability to actually figure out the context language of a page is quite bad. It also seems completely oblivious to the notion that a page may have several languages written on it. Google Translate will decide which language is the dominant one on the page, then translate everything it sees that is not your native language.
Thus, the sequence of events in the video likely went like this:
The proof that this is what happened can be found if you type that guy‚Äôs exact comment into Google Translate in ‚ÄúRussian to English‚Äù mode.
Case closed. Sort of.
And now we come back to Hanlon‚Äôs Razor.
This particular incident did not come about as the result of sinister machinations. That doesn‚Äôt mean that it does not represent a significant problem, nor does it even mean that there isn‚Äôt a hint of the sinister lurking beneath the surface.
Let‚Äôs start off with the obvious: the tech industry needs a viral rumor about Orwellian censorship like it needs a hole in the head. Through their own doing, the big tech brands currently enjoy a reputation approaching that of Bank of America in 2009. Somewhere between Zuckerberg experimenting on his users, Twitter enlisting a rogue‚Äôs gallery of villainous organizations to form their ‚ÄúTrust and Safety‚Äù Council, and Google demonetizing harmless channels, not to mention the fact that every one of them collaborates with the Chinese government, which still maintains pictures of a certain clown-haired mass-murderer on their buildings, the tech giants are increasingly seen as the evil corporations from 1980s cyberpunk flicks.
Combine that with the fact that there is a general apprehension about the notion that we are in a ‚Äúpost-truth world‚Äù (we aren‚Äôt), and you have a powder keg awaiting some scandal to ignite it.
Your typical UX designer or product manager can‚Äôt do much about that whole issue, unfortunately. Nor can designers prevent programmers from building sloppy algorithms that lead to misleading errors. You‚Äôre just going to have to work around these realities by minimizing the chances that a design blunder will be misconstrued as a digital atrocity and tank your employer‚Äôs stock value, or even put them on the hit list of a regulatory agency.
Here are three takeaways from this story that you would ignore at your peril.
Dan Saffer, author of Microinteractions, refers to modes as ‚Äúa fork in the rules‚Äù. When a particular interaction can behave in multiple ways depending on a certain variable, it has multiple modes. One ubiquitous mode is ‚Äúedit mode‚Äù, found everywhere from the iPhone‚Äôs text message screen to Medium‚Äôs articles. In edit mode, you no longer merely consume the information on the screen, but you can alter it.
Misunderstanding of what mode you are in can cause all sorts of problems. If you don‚Äôt realize you are in ‚Äúedit‚Äù mode, you might accidentally delete a text message thread. If you don‚Äôt realize your keyboard is in Caps Lock mode, you might send off a reply that makes you look UNHINGED.
The case of the altered YouTube comments is a clear-cut example of mode confusion. The user thought he was in original text mode, when in fact he was in Russian-to-English mode. Simply making it more obvious to this user the mode he was in could have prevented the entire fiasco.
Currently, this is how Chrome indicates that you are in translation mode:
That‚Äôs it. A single, tiny mystery meat button in the URL bar. What are the chances that the user will even notice it? Why not text that states ‚ÄúTranslating Russian to English‚Äù?
What I gather from this particular incident is that the user was unaware that translation was even a possible explanation for what happened, which suggests that he did not ask for a translation of the page. I don‚Äôt know enough about the underlying software to know if he ever manually set the browser to always translate Russian to English, but if he did not do so, that is a big problem.
The more you take control away from the user, the less they will understand the way your system works, and the less they will trust it. In the short term, you may believe that you are taking a load off the user‚Äôs shoulders, however over time, they will begin to question what is happening, especially if anything should go wrong, which it will.
While political motivations played no role in this incident, users‚Äô distrust of YouTube and Google has partly political origins. And it isn‚Äôt just about corporate-level skullduggery. Tech products are often designed in ways that transparently betray the creators‚Äô personal values, and even impose them on the user.
One infamous example is Apple‚Äôs autocorrect. If you have ever wanted to throw your phone into a wall because it corrected you to ‚Äúducking‚Äù for the 300th time, you know what I‚Äôm talking about. Apple does not allow you to train the autocorrect and autocomplete to reflect your personal linguistic values. Is it such an outrageous stretch to go from the soft censorship of autocorrect to the hard censorship of public comment Bowdlerization?
Even though, in this case, the user was mistaken, Google got themselves into this mess. Lucky for them the rumor was quickly squelched and that was that. They might not be so lucky next time.

Day after day, I see companies break this rule, and it is 100% of the time to their detriment. In this article I will explain what that rule is, and what it means to product and service design. I‚Äôll also raise the possible implications of this phenomenon on organizational management, collaboration, and general performance. The psychological phenomenon I will be discussing in this article is known as Miller‚Äôs Law. Rather than just tell you what Miller‚Äôs Law is, I ask you to take part in this exercise for a more immersive learning lesson.
Read the italicized instructions before starting. Grab a pen and paper. This is an exercise where you will try to recall words you‚Äôve just read, off memory.
Below is a list of 20 words. Read them to comprehension , and try to memorize as many as possible. Try to keep the words ‚Äòin your head‚Äô. Do not write the words. Spend about a minute. After you are done reading, scroll down until you see the word ‚ÄòSTOP‚Äô. Then, read step 2.

Now, use your pen and paper to write down as many words as you can remember from the list. Think hard, but do not scroll back up to view the words. If you scroll up, the experiment is ruined. Give yourself about half a minute...Once you have finished writing the words you tried to recall, scroll back up and check how many you got right.
If you are like the vast majority of human beings, you will have remembered 5‚Äì9 of the words. Hundreds of experiments prove universality of this limitation on memory. When I first discovered this phenomenon, I knew it had huge implications on product design, because of the degree to which this limitation affects day to day tasks. This capacity for keeping ~7 bits of information ‚Äòin the head‚Äô short term, is known as Miller‚Äôs Law.
In 1956 there was a paper written that became one of the most highly cited papers in psychology. Titled, The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information, it was published in 1956 by the cognitive psychologist George A. Miller of Princeton University‚Äôs Department of Psychology in Psychological Review. The crux of the paper suggests that the number of perceptual ‚Äòchunks‚Äô an average human can hold in working memory (a component of short-term memory) is 7 ¬± 2. This is frequently referred to as Miller‚Äôs law. Here is a summary of the article, sourced from wikipedia:
Moreover, the human mind can remember ~7 bits of information when completing a task that requires cognitive effort. This is critical, because humans are constantly performing tasks, and trying to juggle various stimuli in the mind when doing so. One of the key concepts behind Miller‚Äôs Law is ‚Äòchunking‚Äô, which basically means assembling various bits of information into a cohesive gestalt. For example, the word ¬∑ p e n c i l ¬∑ is actually a ‚Äòchunk‚Äô of letters, organized into a perceptual gestalt. If the letters were rearranged ¬∑ c n l i p e ¬∑ it would be six separate chunks of information. Chunking is a critical element of information organization, and is the basis for our UX and organizational rule.
Always organize elements of information in categories no larger than 9, but preferably ~5 chunks.
The more chunks of information you add to an ‚Äòinterface‚Äô, the more difficult it becomes to ‚Äòwork‚Äô, using the information at hand. This is especially critical for first time users, because they haven‚Äôt had the ‚Äòpractice‚Äô needed to encode the interface into long term memory, or, for the behaviour to become habitual. I constantly see this rule being broken by giants like Facebook, Google, and Wordpress. Don‚Äôt even get me started on automobile interface design. The ~5 bit chunk rule also compliments minimalism as a rigorous design philosophy. To expound, due to the limitations of working memory, as a product becomes more feature-full it inevitably becomes more difficult to use, because the user has to manage more information while operating the product. This makes good information design so critical.
Millers Law also highlights the importance of foresight and proper planning in the design process, because as you add more features to a product ‚Äî your interface must be able to accommodate those new features without breaking the visual foundation of what you built. Rebuilding a foundation takes immense time and resources.
Another perceptual phenomenon observed in relation to Miller‚Äôs Law is known as the primacy, and recency effect. These terms are used respectively to describe how we remember items sensed at the beginning and end of an experience, more than ones in the middle. For example, if I were to show you a list of words, you would more likely remember the words at the beginning of the list, and the end. This is also known as the serial position effect. From wikipedia:
This observation raises huge questions in business and design. If people remember more at the beginning and end of an experience, how do we enhance the positives, and mitigate the negatives at these respective times? When does an experience truly begin and end? Should we be organizing more important elements at the beginning and end of lists due to their increased retention? These are all valid questions that UX designers and executives should ask when inventing or developing their product.
Millers Law can be applied to any aspect of your life that involves performing a mildly complex task. By reducing the amount of elements in your reach/access ‚Äî and keeping them organized by relevant chunks not exceeding 9 bits, your brain will be able to remember exactly where things are so you can access its functionality. When lists of items grow too large, they become very difficult to mentally map them, requiring the user to do more cumbersome searching.
The adherence to Miller‚Äôs Law is especially relevant in the light of lean methodologies and recent trends in tech and UX. Users want and need a trial before they purchase something ‚Äî it‚Äôs that simple. If they don‚Äôt experience the value within the first day or week of using it ‚Äî they won‚Äôt buy. Since new users do not have lengthly time to learn where everything is ‚Äî information design needs to be planned and well thought out before development happens.
We live in a world with an exponentially increasing amount of information. By not organizing it properly, or eliminating some completely, it ultimately degrades our ability to complete critical tasks for the purposes of survival (navigation/gaining income). That is why it‚Äôs so useful to omit items, products, and services from your life that aren‚Äôt giving a quality return on investment. This falls in line with the Pareto principle, the idea that 80% of your outcomes comes from 20% of your investments. Are you juggling too many tasks per day to be efficient? Is your team using too many tools to collaborate? Do you have too many members on your team? Are you overloading your new employees with information, leading to confusion?
Millers law teaches us that humans have a finite amount of information they can process, and that information overload will lead to distraction that negatively affects performance. Companies should look for ways to organize information in a way that is much more digestible for their customers and employees. This could be by eliminating tools or applications that are producing cognitive overload, reducing the amount of members on a team, or even organizing your departments based on our knowledge of working memory.
This is especially true in new science of the concept of flow, made famous by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is a word Mihaly coined to describe a state of concentration or ‚Äòabsorption‚Äô with a specific task that humans ultimately find rewarding, pleasurable, and fulfilling. He describes it as an optimal state where we perform at our best and truly live ‚Äòin the moment‚Äô. One sure way to kill flow is by increasing distractions in the workplace. So, do you think that by giving your employees more tools, that it actually enhances performance? Miller‚Äôs Law teaches us time and time again this is not the case. When it comes to completing tasks, less is more.
Turn off your desktop slack notifications. Get rid of the things you never use. Stop checking your various inboxes. Master one tool, not many. Now start focusing.

‚Äî Cool, I‚Äôm Joe, project manager. Glad to have you on the team.
‚Äî Glad to be here. How can I help?
‚Äî So... We have designed a first version of our app, but we‚Äôre now thinking of doing the UX to improve a few things... People are downloading the app, using it once, but not really coming back to it over time.
What they meant: can you help us think through the app‚Äôs interaction design, structure and navigation?
Where the misconception is: presuming one single person is responsible for successfully conceiving, designing, implementing and validating the user‚Äôs experience with a product.
A good user experience depends on:
What they meant: I love the interface you designed.
Where the misconception is: UX is an abstract noun, not concrete.
What they meant: this user interface is hard to use.
Where the misconception is: that good UX = good usability.
UX stands for User Experience. A user‚Äôs experience with your product can be good or bad (in the example above, probably bad). UX Designers are not magic creatures holding a wand that simply ‚Äúadds‚Äù UX to an interface. The UX was already there ‚Äî it was just making the user‚Äôs life miserable.
What they meant: iougarklasjbsdfgaiweoqiuwyrshbe.
Where the problem is: in the world.
What they meant: learn a few best practices that will help you make less mistakes when designing app interfaces that will live on Android-powered devices.
Where the misconception is: thinking that every single Android app experience is the same, and that there are a series of universal laws that work for any Android app ‚Äî from a game to an ecommerce app, including dating apps and maps.
It‚Äôs like creating a course for architects called ‚Äúlearn how to design lofts‚Äù. No matter whether it is a 300 or 3000 square-foot one. Whether it is residential or a storage area. Whether it is for a single person, or for a family of eight. Whether it is built in a Rio favela or on an Icelandic plateau. Whether it will be made of clay or steel. ‚ÄúIn one weekend you will learn how to create lofts for any situation.‚Äù

Jasper Stephenson|6.9K|5|https://uxdesign.cc/the-spectrum-of-digital-design-roles-in-2018-3286390a9966?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|The spectrum of design roles in 2018 ‚Äì UX Collective|"Recently, a colleague of mine named Mariko Sugita needed to hire a designer for a website she was creating. She‚Äôs an urbanist, and not particularly involved in the digital design field, so she asked the closest designer who happened to be on hand (me), ‚Äúwhat kind of designers should I be looking for?‚Äù
I thought for a moment and realized that I had several possible answers, none of which quite summed up the full scope of roles that are present in our field today and what each designer‚Äôs assumed title really says about their abilities.
That started me thinking about what exactly the spectrum of digital design roles really looks like here in Common Era 2018. I started sketching out my ideas. When Mariko saw my notes for this article, she said, ‚Äúyes, that‚Äôs exactly what I wanted to know beforehand!‚Äù I hope that this overview can be just as useful for you, too. Let‚Äôs begin!
It would be irresponsible to casually lump designers into groups without qualifying that no two designers are the same. I‚Äôm taking a moment here to borrow an idea from a great post by Sam Jarman on dev.to, who in turn got the idea from The Soft Skills Engineering Podcast. The basic concept is that rather than thinking that any person‚Äôs skills are just T-shaped ‚Äî the idea that they have a broad understanding of many things and a deep understanding of one thing ‚Äî their skills are instead better understood as a line of wet paint drawn across canvas.
The paint forms a broad line across the top layer of the canvas, signifying a base level of understanding of many fields, but it also drips down in many places, in different depths, which represent the varying depths of different skills that a designer has. The point is that every designer has varying degrees of ability in different skills based on their experience, whether that‚Äôs vector design, digital prototyping, user research, coding, motion graphics, or anything across the entire creative spectrum. Therefore, the title they call themselves on paper can‚Äôt possibly hope to define their philosophy and scope of experience.
I hear you loud and clear. So, with the knowledge that we will never truly represent the full scope of any one human with a single deterministic title, let‚Äôs try to define some singular, deterministic titles.
All sarcasm aside, here begins an honest look (in my own, personal opinion) at what kind of design roles are generally being seen out there in the wild.
‚ÄúBut Jasper, you just finished saying that T-shaped designers don‚Äôt exist!‚Äù Yes, I did. And they don‚Äôt. But if you want to laser focus in on hiring a person to do a specific thing for you, you might as well find someone who describes themselves as a specialist. You can usually count on someone who goes by one of these titles to do that specific task at a very high level of quality.
Also, yes, I put front-end developers on a chart about designers. There‚Äôs enough blurring of the line between designer and developer these days that I feel like it‚Äôs important to have a baseline of where the full-time devs stand on the spectrum.
One note on reading these charts: the upper line of a role represents the common breadth of that role, while the shade beneath represents varying depths of ability along the spectrum.
Here we start to blur some lines into generalized roles, especially the role of UX Designer which I‚Äôve seen take on an incredible breadth of definitions in the past few years. These tend to serve more as catch-all terms, and it‚Äôs not always easy to be sure what a designer going by this title is skilled in. This is where portfolios and interviews can back up a vague title with solid examples of what exactly this designer brings to the table and how strong their skills are on visuals, implementation, and ideation.
These are the ones who can do it all, but they have to spread their knowledge and expertise across multiple fields in order to do it. Often people in this category got there by necessity ‚Äî maybe they worked at startups that demanded they perform roles outside their expertise, or they had personal projects where they had to cover all the bases themselves.
Some designers are quick to naysay the possibility of one person being a master in several fields simultaneously. I tend to think that those with exceptional experience or talent can tackle the challenge, especially because they tend to understand the full scope of the roles around them better than other designers. It‚Äôs a matter of understanding that this designer brings breadth over specificity to the table, and helping them succeed accordingly.
So, if we put all three of those together, what does it look like?
Kind of a mess. But an understandable one, hopefully.
Did I help you figure out what type of designer to look for for your project? Did I mislabel your role or miss it entirely? Let me know in the comments!

They are the best source of user interaction. User provides his information and input through forms and system interprets this information to fulfill user requests.
Two important input controls are radio buttons and drop-down menus. Both of them can be used interchangeably when an input is required from user.
However, if we study about the usability of these controls, it becomes apparent that radio buttons and drop-downs should be used in certain scenarios to make it easier for user to select a given input.
Below are few rules based on this usability study that will help you to decide about one of these controls while designing a form.
There can be multiple cases where you want to emphasize options:
In example, using a drop-down menu does not seem good as default option does not give a clue about other options.
Lesser options are good to place side by side so that:
It is better to use radio buttons when user has to select from 2 to 4 options, as shown in example.
Comparable options are good to place side by side because:
A good example above is about selection of subscription plan where user has to make a serious decision.
Clear visibility and quick scan of options is more understandable for user.
It is obvious from given example that long forms provide good user experience when all select-able options are visible to user.
Viewing only the recommended option makes easier for user to decide the selection because:
In example, there is no need to display all options as here is lesser chance for user to change the default option.
Large number of familiar options are encouraged to display in drop-down because:
Large number of options are not good to display side by side because:
Also, for a long drop-down, it is a good practice to provide a text box where user can type the option name and list displays filtered options only. This makes selection easier and quicker.
To enhance form‚Äôs user experience, it is very important to provide correct controls to take user‚Äôs input. Since forms can be very long with large number of options, it becomes tedious for user if he has to make extra clicks to fill his information. The given set of rules will help you to decide between two controls, radio buttons and drop-down menus, while designing your forms.

Every month I reflect on ‚ÄòHow I can be a better Designer‚Äô. I learned through my background in visual arts that you can train yourself to draw better in a shorter period of time (literally).
I experimented with this in the Summer of 2013. My goal then was to achieve realistic sketches of eyes that captured human emotion. To do this I gave myself a 30-minute time limit and these were the results...
This technique can be applied to design as well ‚Äî I found that great ideas don‚Äôt always require a lot of time. We want to reduce our own tendencies to overthink, agonize and get distracted from the problem in front of us.
I like to describe rapid prototyping as not just wireframes.
What you see at the end of a rapid prototyping session are wireframes that you can use to demonstrate the idea but within these ‚Äòwireframes‚Äô are solutions.
I was once asked by a UX Designer ‚Äòhow I show my design thinking‚Äô. He found it difficult to show employers how he thinks about design since compared to UI, design thinking can‚Äôt be physically seen.
My answer: sketches and rapid prototyping shows others how you think through problems. Your solutions should come to you through sketching, feedback and multiple design iterations.. that‚Äôs where the story is told. It just depends on how you read it. Like good UX ‚Äî the true power of the UX process is hidden. This is where we can train ourselves to think fast, seek validation and refine our own design process.
The premise of this method is to sketch for 8 minutes, 6 minutes, 4 minutes and 2 minutes with quick 2 minute feedback sessions in between.
I learned about this method in my post-grad program. I‚Äôve only realized recently that exercises like these have made it almost natural to incorporate feedback into everything I design. Being open to feedback helps you keep your designs in check by making you aware of things you may not have thought about ‚Äî the ‚Äúunknown unknowns‚Äù (Donald Rumsfeld).
For example: Pizza and Geolocation ‚Äî Pizza on the fly or geocaching for pizza slices... The idea is to practice coming up with ideas on the spot and screens based on how a potential user would navigate through the application. It‚Äôs best to have someone next to you to ask for feedback!
The 3 words I chose were:
I visited the Sagrada FamiÃÅlia in Barcelona, May of 2016. I remember waiting in the line and upon reaching the entrance I was handed this clunky device with plastic headphones ‚Äî they call it the ‚ÄúAudioguide‚Äù.
The idea for my application was to have a Near Field Communication (NFC) sticker (1) at various historical site (2) locations. These stickers function like Android or Apple Pay where an application or website opens up on your phone in close range. When you tap your mobile device at a historical site location, you would have access to an audio tour right from your phone. The geolocation (3) feature would allow you to select historical sites nearby and generates an itinerary for you.
Feedback: To consider adding filters to the historical sites by distance, include descriptions and reviews.
Maybe you‚Äôre like me and you‚Äôve received the congratulatory email on Day 100 üéâ with nothing to show for it. This was the simple twist I added to get myself started.
If you want to go one step further ‚Äî set up a Skype date with a friend to make sure that the both of you would have something to show at the end of the hour. Win-win.
Take a moment in your day-to-day to note down real world problems that you wish there were better solutions for. You might already a list or two or five. It‚Äôs time to solve that problem.
By practicing these rapid prototyping exercises you can train yourself to think through solutions faster and to always validate your ideas.

Tom Hall|3.6K|11|https://uxplanet.org/how-to-choose-a-user-research-method-985112051d84?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|How to choose a user research method ‚Äì UX Planet|"‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your process?‚Äù
This is a question that you‚Äôll often get from prospective clients, or in an interview for a UX design position. Of course, your exact process will end up being at least a little bit different for just about any UX design project you undertake. Whatever your full answer may be, as I recently wrote, user research has to be a part of that process. In most cases, you just can‚Äôt afford not to do it.
What‚Äôs less clear is what kind of user research you should do. There are a lot of different techniques to choose from, each with different strengths, weaknesses, and research goals. This article is intended to give a quick rundown of how to decide on what your research goals are, and what techniques you can use to achieve those goals.
The most important question to ask yourself before deciding on what research methods to use is: What do I want to know?
How do you go about answering that question? You could start by asking yourself why you want to learn that thing. Identify what you already know about your users, and what you don‚Äôt know about them. What are your knowledge gaps? Some examples of useful questions that you may or may not already know the answers to:
Once you know what you‚Äôre trying to learn, you can start thinking about how to learn it.
One way to break down the methods, suggested by Christian Rohrer, is on two axes: Attitudinal vs. Behavioural studies, and Qualitative vs. Quantitative studies. In attitudinal studies, you‚Äôre trying to find out what people say about a subject, while in behavioural studies, you‚Äôre analyzing what people are actually doing. Qualitative methods tend to be stronger for answering ‚Äúwhy‚Äù types of questions, while quantitative methods do a better job of answering questions like ‚Äúhow many‚Äù and ‚Äúhow much‚Äù.
For example, if you‚Äôre asking the question: ‚ÄúHow many users give up partway through our sign up process?‚Äù, then you might want to consider a more quantitative, behavioural study.
Tomer Sharon has offered a different framework for categorizing research questions, which I‚Äôve found very useful. He suggested that there are broadly three types of questions that UX research is helpful for answering:
You need to understand what your product should be doing (the needs and wants of users) before worrying about whether the product is doing that thing correctly (usability).
So, which techniques can you use to answer each question type? I‚Äôm going to break some of them down below. This is by no means an exhaustive list of user research techniques, and some of these techniques could be used to answer more than one of the question types, but nevertheless it should provide a good starting point.
A quick aside: Before starting any user research project, it‚Äôs important to keep a couple of things in mind:
Also called observation, or a site visit, contextual inquiry involves studying people as they go about their everyday lives or tasks. If you‚Äôre performing a contextual inquiry study on engineers who produce intelligent piping and instrumentation diagrams, you would go to their office and watch an engineer go about their job. Have them show you how they do things. Ask them questions such as ‚ÄúHow do you do that?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan you show me how you did that?‚Äù to try to dig more deeply into how they‚Äôre accomplishing their tasks.
Take notes about what they‚Äôre doing, what difficulties they face, and your own thoughts on it all. You want to try and get into their head to help understand their needs and expectations, but try not to interrupt them more than necessary. As much as possible, you should be trying to observe what would they typically do to accomplish their tasks.
I‚Äôm going to lump ethnographic research in here as well. Ethnographic research tends to focus more on social groups and how they collaborate or interact together, but it has a lot of overlap with contextual inquiry and can be useful for answering some similar types of questions.
In user interviews, you‚Äôll typically meet with users, one at a time, and ask them questions relevant to your project. Usually this is done quite early in the process, and it can be useful for reviewing your product goals. You need practice to get good at interviewing users. Questions often have to be asked in the right way to get good responses, you have to know when to follow up and dig in to an answer, and you have to be able to listen well. You should definitely have an interview protocol or script prepared beforehand.
Remember that during an interview, users can often make up an opinion that they don‚Äôt actually feel strongly about. They can also talk a lot about things that don‚Äôt actually matter to them, which can be misleading.
One technique that can help with this is called the critical incident technique. Your interview subjects may remember some specific cases where the product worked particularly well or poorly, and can often provide more vivid details about these incidents. You can use this to get an idea of the strengths and weaknesses of your product when it comes to helping users accomplish their tasks.
You can also use interviews to help you identify questions to ask in a broader questionnaire or survey. On the other hand, you can use interviews after you‚Äôve seen the results of a questionnaire and want to dive into some of those questions more deeply.
Surveys and questionnaires can provide you with some answers similar to what you‚Äôd get from user interviews. The downside is that you don‚Äôt have the ability to dive more deeply into those answers as there‚Äôs no direct interaction with the users. On the plus side, they allow you to get a larger volume of responses, which can open up the opportunity for more quantitative analysis.
Just like in user interviews, you need to be careful about how you‚Äôre writing your questions. You‚Äôll want to keep the survey as short as you can while still getting the information that you want; if the survey is too long, you may find that you don‚Äôt get as many responses as you‚Äôd like. Surveys can be relatively inexpensive to run, and there are a lot of survey tools out there to choose from.
A diary study can be used to see what users do and how they interact with your product over a longer time frame. Diary studies can often be used as a follow up to a contextual inquiry or an interview, to get some additional information from some of the more engaged and informative users that you encountered.
In some cases you may ask users to take photos, scrapbook, or other similar activities. You have to make sure that you give the users good instructions so that they‚Äôre clear on what they should be doing, and follow up with them at certain intervals to try to keep them engaged.
In A/B testing, you create two variations of an element of your product, such as a registration form. The variations could be represented by anything from a simple paper prototype to a live website. You then define a metric that will measure the success of each variation that you‚Äôve created. For example, you could measure the bounce rate or the NPS of a landing page.
Next, you run an experiment with users where one group sees ‚ÄúVersion A‚Äù and another group sees ‚ÄúVersion B‚Äù. Using the metric you defined, you‚Äôll measure which version was more successful. That‚Äôs the one the users want. You can do this process with more than just two variations, in which case it‚Äôs called multivariate testing.
You can use A/B testing to examine a wide variety of things, such as:
A/B testing is an excellent and powerful user research tool. There‚Äôs a lot of nuance to doing an A/B test correctly, so make sure you‚Äôre designing your study appropriately and that you‚Äôve brushed up on concepts like statistical significance so you know when to stop the study.
The idea behind rapid prototyping is to get your designs in front of users early and often. Rapid prototyping is done iteratively, in a three-step process:
The more you can do this early on, the less you‚Äôll (ideally) need to make changes during development, when it can be far more expensive.
The fidelity of your prototypes can vary. You might start out with paper, and end up with pixel-perfect high-fidelity mockups. In some cases you might even use some live code.
If you‚Äôre going the paper route, you can put together a sketching kit and start drawing. You can use products like UI Stencils to give you a head start if you feel like you can‚Äôt draw particularly well. You can also use an app like Marvel to make your sketches interactive.
Paper prototypes allow you to test your designs quickly, cheaply, and easily. If you have a real budget crunch, this can be a good way to go. However, it‚Äôs worth keeping in mind that it can be distracting for users if your prototype is too low fidelity. Jake Knapp actively discourages paper prototyping with users, saying that:
Depending on your skill level with your design tool(s) of choice, you might be able to jump directly to high fidelity prototypes. Whichever direction you take, the important thing is to get prototypes in front of users, learn from how they respond to it, and iterate.
Of course, this isn‚Äôt always going to be possible, as some systems are just very difficult to prototype. At ThinkUX, we worked on a VR project where we simply weren‚Äôt able to meaningfully prototype and test some parts of the system before implementing them in code.
I could easily write an entire article about the pitfalls of focus groups. There‚Äôs no shortage of such articles out there. Among the primary issues with focus groups are observer dependency, which is when the researcher reads their own feelings into the results of the group discussion. There‚Äôs also groupthink, and the fact that some particularly vocal members of the group can make it seem like there‚Äôs a consensus even when some quieter members of the group disagree. Further, it‚Äôs worth emphasizing once again that there can be a significant difference between what people say and what they do.
However, when done correctly, focus groups can uncover a lot of very useful information. One of the most interesting results can be discovering a customer language that can help you to understand and describe similar experiences that your users shared. Having a group of users together can also help them to jog memories and ideas in each other that they may not have otherwise remembered.
According to the Nielsen Norman Group, if you do only one type of user research on your project, it should be qualitative usability testing. In usability testing, you recruit some users, come up with a list of tasks for the users to accomplish, and set them loose on your system (or prototype). You can do this formally (create a screener, schedule participants, have them come into your lab, record the session, etc.), or with guerilla usability tactics.
You should test with approximately 5 users, as beyond that you‚Äôll start to see diminishing returns. At the conclusion of a usability test, you‚Äôll often find that parts of your design worked, but that users uncovered problems that you‚Äôd never have thought of, and a lot of things need to be tweaked or reworked. This is why it‚Äôs so important to test your designs with real people.
Card sorting is a technique that can help a lot with your information architecture. Write down the major features or topics for your system on cards, then recruit some users and ask them to organize the cards into categories that make sense to them. You can do open sorting, where participants put the cards into groups and then name the groups themselves, or closed sorting, where you give them defined categories to sort the cards into. The results of a card sorting study can help you to decide the structure of your website, how to label your menus, how to group your content, and so on.
Card sorting can be done in person with index cards, or using an online tool such as Optimal Sort. If you‚Äôre doing the study in person, the most difficult part will likely be analyzing the results, particularly if you‚Äôve recruited a large number of participants.
You‚Äôll typically recruit more users for a card sorting study than with a usability test, but don‚Äôt go overboard here as you‚Äôll tend to get diminishing returns beyond 15 or so users.
Tree testing is another research technique that will help you to assess the information architecture of your product. It can (and likely should) be used along with a card sort. Tree testing helps you to answer questions like:
In a tree test, users navigate the site to complete tasks (e.g. ‚Äúbuy a sweatshirt‚Äù) using only links ‚Äî the user interface is stripped away entirely. If, through previous research, you‚Äôve found that users aren‚Äôt reaching an important page on your website, a tree test can help you to determine if the issue is caused by a problem with your information architecture or by something to do with your UI.
At the end of the study, you‚Äôll end up with metrics such as task success rate, failure rate, time to complete the task, and what routes users took through the site tree before selecting an answer (correctly or incorrectly).
Before you can decide on what research techniques you‚Äôre going to employ, you need to figure out what you‚Äôre trying to learn, and why you want to learn it.
Again, this is not an exhaustive list of UX research techniques. There are a lot of different ways to attack a given problem, but this article should help give you some idea of what techniques you can use in your research, and what kinds of questions they can help you to answer.

Chris Kiess|3.5K|15|https://blog.prototypr.io/confessions-of-a-ux-designer-2dda9e1758a1?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|Confessions of a UX Designer ‚Äì Prototypr|"I‚Äôm about to commit a cardinal sin against the gods of UX in penning this article. My design soul will likely suffer eternal damnation. And, like Judas Iscariot, I‚Äôll be forever haunted by the sound of thirty pieces of silver rattling about in my pocket. Forgive me father, for I am about to sin...and I have sinned.
After more than a decade of projects gone afoul, designs that never made it to development, concepts that should have never made it beyond being a concept and the snail‚Äôs pace of many projects I have worked on, this article is long overdue. I‚Äôd like to be able to write an article placing the blame somewhere other than the UX teams I have worked with. But, that wouldn‚Äôt be honest or true. It wouldn‚Äôt be a confession. Often times, it has been my team or myself to blame for failed projects or projects that could have yielded better results.
At the outset, I must state there is a lot I like and love about UX and design in general. But, there is also a lot that gets under my skin. UX can be a great solution to the problems an organization faces with their products in the market. But, UX can also be part of the problem. I have often become part of the problem.
In life, I have generally found solutions do not come without cost. You often solve one problem and create another. I have seen the same thing happen with UX design in organizations. We solve a lot of problems when introduced to an organization, but often create more via our very existence.
So, I‚Äôm ‚Äúbreaking bad‚Äù with UX. Specifically, I‚Äôm outlining the mistakes I have made and have seen teams make ‚Äî mistakes that inhibit the final product and user‚Äôs experience. In parallel, I am pushing against some of the dogmatic philosophies inherent in our profession. This article is where I see UX go awry. It‚Äôs also a short list of things that irk me about the profession. This is an article about flouting the maxims, thinking for yourself and sometimes, just sometimes, going against the crowd‚Äôs conventional thinking.
Paradoxically, these are all transgressions I have committed in my own past. My sins. These are the confessions of a UX designer.
I don‚Äôt know how my mind dysfunctions. But most of the time when someone gives me a rule, I automatically question it or try to break it. This isn‚Äôt always true. Early in my career, I would follow the rules of UX to a tee. I didn‚Äôt know any better and was too green to have experiences where the rules didn‚Äôt work or to know they weren‚Äôt applicable to the situation.
We‚Äôre designers. We are thinkers. Rules are little more than cognitive offload. Now, I am not suggesting there aren‚Äôt any good design rules or there are not any rules you should follow in UX design. I am merely suggesting we think before we mindlessly follow a design rule.
Here are just a few UX rules you can find in a quick search:
The rules above are less rules than guidelines. Consistency for the sake of being consistent is simply being stupid as I point out below. There is a time to use fake copy and a time not to. Fake copy can actually be advantageous in circumstances when you don‚Äôt want the content to get in the way. It is generally true that you are not the user. However, there are research methods where being the user is appropriate and adds another point of data to your research. It‚Äôs called immersion. And, research of any type is only one point of data. Users do not always tell you what they need nor know what they need. And the seven plus or minus two rule is a classic example of a research study being misinterpreted or, as even Edward Tufte puts it, not read.
It seems like every week or month, a new trend starts in our profession and shortly thereafter, it will become our ‚Äúgolden calf‚Äù until it‚Äôs forgotten or the next new thing comes along. I get tired of rules ‚Äî especially when they are mindlessly followed. I got tired of following the rules and realizing they don‚Äôt always work.
Designers don‚Äôt follow rules all of the time. In fact, they often break rules to create ingenious designs. This, of course, comes with experience. Design is part art and part science. And, great art often breaks rules.
About once or twice per year, I notice an uptick in the UX community on a certain topic. A few people come across an idea or concept in an article or perhaps a presentation at a conference and slowly you‚Äôll see a larger group running to jump on the bandwagon. A few years ago, the hamburger icon became one of those topics.
The basic essence of the argument against the hamburger icon cited low discoverability, lack of recognition and lack of engagement in A/B testing, making a case users just didn‚Äôt understand or use the hamburger icon. Ultimately, the demonization of the hamburger icon was a bit of a boring argument and was based on some pretty weak studies. It ignored the fact that an icon becomes an icon through its pervasive presence. An icon is a language. It‚Äôs a symbol representing a concept just like a letter represents a sound.
Nevertheless, a good percentage of the profession jumped on the bandwagon and demonized the hamburger icon. Lean UX was another trend a few years ago and despite trying to move our profession out of the ‚Äúdeliverable business,‚Äù a brief internet search will quickly reveal we‚Äôre still in the deliverable business with plenty of writings on UX deliverables.
Mobile design is probably my favorite example. This is where teams chase that shiny object and employ a technology simply because it is there. I have been on numerous mobile design initiatives that were complete failures. Hell, even I thought some of them were a good idea at some point. But, I have been burnt so many times that I now scrutinize any proposal for a mobile design with extra vigilance. Just because you can put your design or product on a mobile device doesn‚Äôt mean it should be on one. It‚Äôs a trend teams like to embrace because all the other monkeys are doing it too. Monkey see, monkey do.
If you spend a lot of time surfing the net and regurgitating the last article you read on a specific topic (like I spent so many years doing), you‚Äôll quickly find it isn‚Äôt much different from the current fashion you are wearing. About 5‚Äì10 years from now, you‚Äôll look back at a picture of you sporting those new pants and the shirt you thought was so cool only to laugh at how dated you look. The UX bandwagon is no different. Five years from now, you‚Äôll no longer believe even so much as half of what the current rage in our profession is.
Some trends will stay in our profession. Those are usually theories based on sound foundational principles ‚Äî the principles of our profession from decades of research and application. They‚Äôre like 501 Levis and a solid print t-shirt. They‚Äôll never go out of style. But, most trends will fall by the wayside. Following them will often lead you and your project astray.
As a general rule of thumb: Stay off the bandwagon, stray from the crowd and step to the beat of your own music ‚Äî no matter how measured or far away. And as for those trending concepts that do stick around or seem to hold some validity ‚Äî make sure you aren‚Äôt adopting them just because everyone else is. Don‚Äôt build a mobile app for a user base who would benefit more from a desktop application. Don‚Äôt adopt an idea based on an article you read citing a weak study or misrepresenting a study. In short, critically and strategically evaluate the concepts you add to your repertoire.
I don‚Äôt know if it is a UX designer personality trait to be pedantic and detail-oriented. I don‚Äôt think so because I know a lot of designers who aren‚Äôt. But, I‚Äôve never encountered a profession where discussions over minute details go on ad nauseam and occasionally even stop a project.
Yes, the little things count. I concede to that. And when you have the time and resources to address the little things, you should. But what I see far too often is UX teams coming unglued over the little things while they ignore the larger problems. It‚Äôs as though the house is on fire and we‚Äôre worried about the storage shed in the backyard.
I‚Äôve had long discussions over toggle switches versus checkboxes, radio buttons versus drop menus, rounded versus square corners, save dialogs with multiple options, colors, button placement, grids and more. Long discussions. Discussions lasting weeks or months. Email threads longer than the arms and legs of an NBA All-Star.
There is an appropriate use and there are guidelines for each of these examples. And sure, if you have the time, money and resources to entertain the finer details in a design, then have at it. But if you have bigger fish to fry, your resources and energies are better placed elsewhere.
But, here is where I always land: Does it truly impact the user experience? Does the user really care whether the corners are rounded? Will that impact their experience? Do they care if all of your components snap to a grid? I‚Äôve spent a lot of time in the field on various projects and it is rare I find a user who comments on some aspect of a feature I had discussed ad nauseam with my team. It‚Äôs usually something I never even thought of that turns out to be problematic ‚Äî something we should have spent more time discussing, but didn‚Äôt.
I confess to being sucked into this in the past and even recently. I‚Äôll get into these discussions (most of them surrounding the visual aspects of an interface) and they‚Äôll go on forever. We‚Äôll set up a small team to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù these issues or test a group of users. But at some point, I‚Äôll be sitting there while the discussion drones on and think about how this really impacts the overall design. Usually, it doesn‚Äôt and has very little impact on the user experience from a holistic perspective.
Always ask yourself this one question: Is this an issue, given all of the other issues I have to address, that will impact the user?
Consistency is important. But, I firmly believe the law of diminishing returns comes into play with consistency. How much time are you willing to spend with each screen to ensure absolute consistency? Time is money and will that time spent give you a good ROI?
Obviously, if you have a total lack of consistency between screens and the system doesn‚Äôt even look the same from one screen to the next, it will cause a myriad of problems. But if you are a few pixels off on button sizing from one screen to the next, will this truly impact the user experience? It‚Äôs sloppy design, absolutely. But, it won‚Äôt kill the product on release.
I‚Äôm not suggesting we ignore consistency or the little details I note above. I am only proposing a fair balance between the energy we spend on these things and the return on our investment. If you are working with Atomic Design in a large system, how much upfront work will you do versus the time you will save in designing and amending the design? If it is done right, you can probably reap a greater return on your investment. But at some point, the law of diminishing returns will take effect.
Consistency must also be contextually dependent. Consider a search component in a system. Let‚Äôs suppose you define how search should work and then state it should work the same throughout the entire system you are designing. This seems logical right? We would want search to work the same across a system and not trip the user up by switching up the functionality. The only problem with this is we have now prioritized consistency (as a primary heuristic) over the user experience.
Wait a minute, you might ask. Aren‚Äôt heuristics supposed to support the user experience? Yes. When they are used as a guide or rule of thumb they do. When they are strictly applied they may not. In the search example, a different search functionality could be warranted in different parts of a system depending on how complex the search needs to be, how many results may be returned and the size of the database being searched.
Don‚Äôt fall into the trap I have fallen into where you have screens taped up on every wall and spend weeks or months going through them with a fine-toothed comb to gain consistency. This often evolved into a major effort for me and upon release, I discovered larger items I could have been managing instead.
The context of the user‚Äôs experience should be prioritized over consistency. Component or symbol consistency in a system should not become so rigid it does not afford the opportunity to design for the context in which the user is employing that functionality. Being consistent for the sake of being consistent is often just one more way to not use your brain when designing for the user experience.
This may be more of an organizational problem than a UX problem. But, almost every team I have worked with over the course of my career has allowed themselves to be sucked into the release cycle ‚Äî including myself. Yes, you have to release a product and you have to set a deadline that will allow your team to build a product with the time and resources you have. But when the focus is solely on the deadline at the expense of building a great experience and product, you have essentially sold your soul to the company store. Don‚Äôt let the deadline be the spurs that drive you forward.
I have rarely seen a project make its deadline. It happens ‚Äî but not very often. That means there is room to play with a project timeline (since they are usually poor projections driven by financial concerns and put in place by projects managers who don‚Äôt understand the complexities involved in a feature or product). This means you do have the time for that research you wanted to squeeze in or that next iteration of the design.
Yet, this is really about where our focus lies and what we end up chasing in the process of building a product and experience. We often become so focused on deadlines, milestones and release dates, we forget what our true mission is. Nothing annoys me more than a project manager at my desk suggesting we aren‚Äôt going to make a milestone or deadline and we‚Äôll be red-flagged as a result. The deadline is not the goal.
In my case, I have to constantly remind myself I am working on a patient experience. That is my ‚Äúprimary directive.‚Äù I am not showing up each morning to make a deadline for the next sprint. That goal is secondary. My highest loyalty must be to the patient experience.
Here‚Äôs the rub: You can meet the deadline, make all the bean counters and project managers happy and still build a shit product. I‚Äôve done this. I have run the whole race and crossed the wrong finish line a number of times in my career. It‚Äôs not a win. It‚Äôs me sitting at the finish line wondering how in the hell I ended up here.
Stop focusing on the deadline and put your sights on the user experience. Make sure you are running in the right race and on the right track.
If I have to listen to one more debate over design tools and how one tool is better than another, I think I might hang myself by one of my unworn neckties. I had the displeasure of working with a consulting team not too long ago who had the audacity to suggest using one tool would give our team a competitive advantage in the future workforce. Such rubbish. I don‚Äôt know if they were getting kickbacks or if they had just drank too much of their own Kool-Aid.
I grew up with a mechanic ‚Äî my father. (He‚Äôs really more of a mechanical engineer than a mechanic.) But, I always remember all of the tools he had ‚Äî some of which I didn‚Äôt even know what they did. There was a set of tools for every job. I learned by watching him and riding along on his trips to the Sears Craftsman store when he would need some special item. UX is no different. A design tool has a specific purpose and needs to fit the job.
Some tools are better for prototyping and others are better for visual design. You can‚Äôt beat a whiteboard and dry-erase marker to get ideas down quickly. A lot of our choices are very subjective. And, if there is any profession that should know how personal and subjective this choice is, it should be UX.
The mark of an experienced and rational designer is knowing which tool to use in which scenario. Religiosity around tools is simply dogma with no real scientific basis underlying these claims. So, stop sending tweets and writing articles debating which tool is better. If you want to make a useful contribution to the profession, write an article about a design tool‚Äôs features and how you used it in a project to solve a specific problem creating a kick-ass experience.
No one ever actually says it. But, the attitude is often evident even if unspoken. It‚Äôs often territorial. We wouldn‚Äôt want anyone infringing on our space or replacing us, right? It‚Äôs this attitude only those formally trained (or those who hold a job title with UX in it) can design.
We‚Äôve all been there. A business analyst or a developer shows up to your desk with a rough sketch of an idea they have. And, many of us have turned our nose up to these people ‚Äî effectively ostracizing them from our privileged ranks. Who are they to propose a potential solution? I‚Äôve done this and was once a UX snob. I didn‚Äôt want anyone to do anything closely resembling my work.
Fortunately, most of us mature a little and realize this is not only a great way to develop a shared understanding, but also a method of increasing collaboration and rapport with other teams. But, I routinely encounter those insecure UX designers who believe anyone with an idea not bearing the title or training of a UX designer should be pushed out of the circle as quickly as possible. This is simply the wrong attitude to have. These are usually the same types of designers who will spend an inordinate amount of time advocating for UX in an organization and wondering why no one wants to work with them.
As controversial as it may seem (and was at the time), Jared Spool stated:
As a designer working in healthcare UX, I have generally found this statement to be true. The design of a product or service is often not rendered as I originally intended, having been influenced by other teams. Is it so far fetched to believe we build and design a product as a team through our shared understanding of what we are attempting to create? I think not.
If you are having trouble advocating for UX in your organization and looking for acceptance, ensure you aren‚Äôt a UX snob. Your career (and designs) will go a long way if you concentrate on building relationships and bringing different viewpoints (via other disciplines) to the table.
UX is an evolving profession. That‚Äôs probably a good thing. Were we steeped in centuries of tradition (like medicine, for example), we‚Äôd probably have a whole different set of problems. But, we are still finding our way. And, we‚Äôre finding our way in a new world where communication can be enabled through the click of a publish button on the web. We are still finding our space in a profession that, once, largely operated without our assistance. And, we are still attempting to figure out how we integrate ourselves into the product development process.
To accomplish what we need to accomplish requires us to understand more than just our profession. It requires us to see a larger picture, to think bigger and to always maintain a center of balance. That center of balance must connect our daily activities to how it impacts the user experience. That impact falls within what we create and it falls beyond our designs as well. Focusing on the wrong details (details that have little or no impact on the user experience), ostracizing ourselves, employing narrow-minded thinking and embracing the latest trends regardless of their foundational validity will do little more than have us designing in circles.
Yet, these are my confessions as well ‚Äî all transgressions I have committed. I have fallen in all of these traps. And though I would like to say I‚Äôll move forward without falling into future traps, I know I will not live without sin. Ten years from now (likely sooner), I will have an entirely new list of confessions to make. I am not alone though. May the gods of UX have mercy on all our souls.

For many of our readers, the New York Times desktop home page is an important and familiar place to connect with the news each day.
It hasn‚Äôt changed much over the last decade, even as the story formats we use, the platforms we support and the ways our readers consume content online have rapidly evolved.
We‚Äôve invested heavily in making our mobile apps expressive and visually dynamic, but our desktop website has lagged behind, powered by a siloed and aging set of tools.
These fractures in workflow and technology have meant our newsroom editors and our engineering teams had to do duplicate work across multiple systems for our mobile apps and our desktop website.
They weren‚Äôt the only ones. Whenever readers switched between devices, they were met with different reading experiences, which made it hard for them to follow their interests and gave them an inconsistent experience with our brand.
In a few weeks, we will update our desktop home page experience as a final step to bringing readers a consistent experience across all of our platforms and screens. Readers who visit us on mobile have already seen many of the changes. But with the desktop rollout, readers will be able to engage with the stories that interest them most on all of the devices they read The New York Times.
We started our home page project with plenty of data about what people chose to do there, but it was more difficult to tell from the numbers why they made those decisions.
As a product and design team, we always want to go beyond what readers say they like and dislike to understand how reading, watching or listening to our stories fits into their lives.
We realized that in order to help our readers go deeper, our team had to engage deeply with our readers. We visited them at their homes and got to know them. Then we asked them broad questions about how the the news fits into their day ‚Äî or doesn‚Äôt.
We came away from those interviews with a better understanding of three major needs our readers wanted to fulfill on our home page:
We also came away with a strategy for how to help our readers meet those needs.
Readers said they wanted us to curate their experience on the home page, but not limit it. We needed a system that empowered them to follow their own interests. At the same time, readers wanted our help to navigate a chaotic world of information overload and filter bubbles.
We used those insights to begin sketching out possible ways to address reader needs that also mapped clearly to our mission and goals.
While we design layouts and custom-made typography with care, we also know what truly makes or breaks the reading experience is the content itself. Our readers told us loud and clear: what matters is access to New York Times journalism.
To test our initial concepts, we needed to see how they would hold up with real news flowing through them. So we created a series of prototypes to gather feedback from a small panel of readers.
Our first round of prototypes were pretty crude. We built them quickly, with the intention of testing our assumptions and threw most of them away after gathering data. We started out with simple paper prototypes. (Our favorite was a cardboard and paper iPhone we nicknamed ‚ÄúThe pPhone.‚Äù)
The more prototypes we built, the more confidence we gained. We knew we probably weren‚Äôt going to get everything right the first time (spoiler: we didn‚Äôt). But we also knew how much we could learn when we got things wrong.
Once we gained confidence through paper prototyping, we moved on to a higher-fidelity web prototype and recruited a few news editors to run it using some bare-bones publishing tools.
While our readers helped articulate the original needs that inspired our designs, our prototype editors were instrumental in stress-testing our concepts. They gave us feedback on how well the stories they wanted to highlight fit into our proposed structure and helped us calibrate what areas of the page needed to be elevated or suppressed.
Having editors join the conversation early on helped us quickly understand what was working and what might be missing. The editors were also candid with us about standard newsroom practices and internal dynamics that we needed to consider. The first time a major story broke, we learned that our system and tools would need maximum flexibility to support a wide variety of news scenarios.
Throughout this design process, many members of our product, design and engineering teams also volunteered to curate the home page for a day to gain first-hand experience of what the home page workflow was like under the constant pressure of breaking news. Embedding directly with our news editors showed that we were committed to making our home page work for them and gave us plenty of empathy for what it takes to produce the home page every day.
By working closely together, we developed a version of the home page that was polished enough for wider distribution. To prepare for a larger-scale rollout to a subset of readers, we worked with our internal tools teams to build more realistic tools that let the newsroom curate the new version of the home page.
While we always planned to launch a fully responsive home page, our early tests left us most confident in our new features at the mobile breakpoint. We solidified and rolled out our changes to all mobile readers in October of last year.
Creating the right layouts to scale our newsroom curation efforts up to more complex desktop and tablet layouts took our team another cycle of iteration. With mobile fully live, we launched our initial desktop concepts to a small percentage of readers, and studied metrics and qualitative survey feedback closely, while making adjustments.
Early in our desktop test, we focused on showing readers the breadth of our coverage. We limited the number of prominent stories at the top of the page and used layouts that highlighted more of our photography. The page layout was airy and encouraged readers to scroll more.
But readers pushed back. While they didn‚Äôt want to be overwhelmed, they were eager to see more related news stories in order to get a complete picture of the day‚Äôs news.
The ratio of photography to information also felt off. In a news cycle where much of our major news came from Washington D.C., the photos of politicians in suits soon felt repetitive and stale from day to day.
In order to give readers a more nuanced picture of the news and editors the flexibility to choose which visual and text elements to highlight, we developed a system of tools and layouts that let editors group a few related stories into a ‚Äústory package.‚Äù
Creating a system for packages that would work across every device and support all of the possible grouping combinations was a complex design and development task, but it ultimately gave us more flexibility to create strong presentations for every news situation.
It also helped the page look more dynamic for readers because there was more depth and density at the top of the page.
We also added visual differentiation between hard news stories and softer features to help readers quickly distinguish between types of content. This provided a better visual rhythm on desktop where stories are frequently displayed side by side.
Our home page update is a significant step forward in helping our readers meet their needs across all of their devices. Our investments in a new technical architecture will make the site faster for readers and more flexible for our teams. We are confident that the system of story groups and packages we‚Äôve created will allow us to continue evolving the experience in ways we can‚Äôt even imagine today. We‚Äôve created a system that‚Äôs rooted in highlighting both what our readers feel is important to read and what they want to read. Best of all, it can grow and adapt as those needs do, too.

Here‚Äôs something I bet you haven‚Äôt heard yet:
Include the goddamn cover letter. If it‚Äôs good, it will set you apart. And if you‚Äôre dealing with a hiring manager who doesn‚Äôt read cover letters, it doesn‚Äôt hurt anything to include one.
What to write? Use your design thinking skills. When you‚Äôre applying to work for me, I‚Äôm your end user. Think about what I want to hear.
Here‚Äôs how to write a letter that will get you noticed.
First, make sure to include a greeting. You know you‚Äôre writing to someone. Remember your basic writing skills and manners.
Second, make a best guess about the specific someone you‚Äôre writing to. LinkedIn exists, and so does CrunchBase. It‚Äôs not hard to guess as to the recipient. You might get it wrong, but that‚Äôs ok; I‚Äôd rather read a cover letter addressed directly to a colleague in Human Resources than read a cover letter addressed to ‚ÄúDear Hiring Manager.‚Äù
The very first sentence should tell me why you‚Äôre writing me ‚Äî even if you‚Äôre applying through an online job portal. Include the name of the job, and tell me that you might be a great fit.
But for crying out loud, don‚Äôt tell me you are a perfect fit. Compare the above with this:
Let me make that decision, okay? That‚Äôs my job.
Here‚Äôs another thing I don‚Äôt want to read:
I already know that you‚Äôre looking for a job, and your passion and/or talent will come through in your portfolio. I don‚Äôt need to hear about it here.
Then, tell me a) that you‚Äôve read the job description, and b) how your experience matches my needs.
There it is: your two-sentence opening paragraph. As a hiring manager, I now know the following:
Let‚Äôs move on.
Don‚Äôt tell me about your personality. And don‚Äôt tell me what you will do; tell me what you‚Äôve already done.
Alternatively:
I once received a cover letter that was likely intended to demonstrate the candidate‚Äôs commitment to best practices, but sadly, came across as preachy. It was a list of ‚Äúmusts‚Äù and it went something like this:
It‚Äôs nice that you‚Äôre committed to best practices, but you‚Äôve just told me that you‚Äôre too rigid to work for me. I work at a startup, and we all need to flex on best practices sometimes.
Also, you‚Äôve just told me that you‚Äôll get frustrated if we don‚Äôt design mobile-first. Maybe there‚Äôs no mobile use case for the product; does your ‚Äúmust‚Äù still hold true? I don‚Äôt think so.
Something like this:
So there you go: a cover letter that is short, clear, humble, and focused on what the hiring manager cares about. If a hiring manager takes the time to read cover letters, this will set you apart from the crowd.
Here it is in its entirety:
Go forth, and enjoy getting noticed.

Sungjoon Steve Won|2.2K|6|https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-speak-up-impact-conversations-as-a-junior-designer-f868064526c5?source=tag_archive---------9---------------------|How to speak up and impact conversations as a junior designer|"A large part of my week is spent in meeting rooms, design critiques, and spontaneous discussions. This was true when I was an individual contributor, and it became increasingly so after I transitioned into a lead role few years back and then into a head of studio role in the beginning of 2017. I have to have every Wednesday fully blocked out so that I can focus on completing tasks on my plate, and I try very hard to keep those days meeting-free as intended.
But I value these meetings, as long as they are kept to be efficient in time and effective in discussion flows. It‚Äôs an opportunity to get your idea out, get feedback, cross-pollinate ideas from everyone, and impact conversations. Sitting in a room full of talented peers and co-workers, it is common to find yourself swimming in a pool overflowing with ideas. These ideas may conflict with each other, and some of them may even conflict with your own. Unless you can speak up and make your points relevant to others, the exchange of these ideas can overwhelm your voice from being heard and even affect what you were working on.
Though this is unfortunate, fewer people may be leaning in by default to hear you out when you are a junior designer or an individual contributor in some meetings. As a result, these situations require you to try harder to get your point across. But whether you are in the room amongst your peers, leads, managers, or directors, you shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to speak up. I‚Äôve thought about what I tried when I was a junior designer, and put together a number of ways that worked for me.
As a junior designer, you may already be fully occupied and perhaps satisfied with solely focusing on completing the design tasks delegated to you by your manager. There isn‚Äôt anything wrong with that, and doing that well may already be handful. However, it is worth taking a step further.
Output from design critiques, weekly sync, and hallway conversations often turns into a set of tasks and action items, some of which will be delegated to you. By speaking up, you can build a sense of ownership to what will come out as the meeting output and increase the chance of working things that align with your point-of-view. Wouldn‚Äôt that be more fulfilling compared to potentially working on something that seem irrelevant to your interests & passion?
The second reason is for growth. Ability to influence others with your ideas becomes more important as you grow into a senior designer and then a lead or manager role. It‚Äôs never too early to start working on ways to do so.
The first step is throwing your opinion out there without hesitation, whether it gets incorporated into the final outcome or not. It is okay to speak up even if it is may be different from other‚Äôs POV (point-of-view) and better if it is clear how your opinion adds a new perspective to the process. The beauty of working together is, the team can look at something from varying perspectives and understand the landscape better before making a decision. Every perspective counts.
Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found useful when
It‚Äôs easy to keep your opinion to yourself and let others discuss among themselves. Even if you don‚Äôt, it feels okay to do so since nothing will fall out of expectations.
Still, speak up. Express and advocate for the other person‚Äôs point-of-view that you relate with. This is an easy opportunity to let others be aware that you have an opinion on the matter and that your perspective counts.
There can be two or more reasons to why you have a different POV from everyone else. Sometimes your idea is just bad. In this case, someone else may also have thought about the same idea and decided not to share it for that reason. Other times, your idea is good but others are not up to speed with you yet. ; You have to be as objective with your ideas as you can be, so you can tell when people aren‚Äôt receptive because the ideas are bad. So, how can you speak up when it is the latter and not the former?
What holds you back from speaking up might be fear of criticism or dismissal.
People on the project like your design, but your manager or project lead isn‚Äôt so sure. Rather than taking the lukewarm response as the answer and putting a halt on your idea, what can you do?
Constructive discussion with your manager is a good thing. But you also don‚Äôt want to appear arguing out of pure stubbornness, nor appear as if you are spending too much time on something that wouldn‚Äôt be valuable to the project. So,
Try these.
Make it a goal to say one thing at every meeting. Whether it‚Äôs big or small, say one thing before you walk out of the meeting room. When you have a butterfly in your stomach during a discussion, that‚Äôs likely a sign that there‚Äôs something you want to share with others. Don‚Äôt think too hard. Just speak up the first thought that crosses your mind.
If you are too shy to speak up verbally, draw out your idea & put it up where everyone in the room can see. Have people start discussing it, and you can naturally join in the conversation and explain how you sketched out your thoughts.
I started writing with the intention of creating a single post, but realized midway that it may be better suited to reorganize them into separate posts. So, part two on the topic under way.
Regardless of your level, it‚Äôs important to speak up when you have an opinion and add your perspective when looking at a given problem, design, or topic. You are already beginning to make impact just by speaking up. It is okay to have a different opinion, but it‚Äôs not okay to stay silent about it. I hope some of the ways that worked for me can be of some help to others. If you have ways that worked for you, I would love to learn about them also.

Here‚Äôs something I bet you haven‚Äôt heard yet:
Include the goddamn cover letter. If it‚Äôs good, it will set you apart. And if you‚Äôre dealing with a hiring manager who doesn‚Äôt read cover letters, it doesn‚Äôt hurt anything to include one.
What to write? Use your design thinking skills. When you‚Äôre applying to work for me, I‚Äôm your end user. Think about what I want to hear.
Here‚Äôs how to write a letter that will get you noticed.
First, make sure to include a greeting. You know you‚Äôre writing to someone. Remember your basic writing skills and manners.
Second, make a best guess about the specific someone you‚Äôre writing to. LinkedIn exists, and so does CrunchBase. It‚Äôs not hard to guess as to the recipient. You might get it wrong, but that‚Äôs ok; I‚Äôd rather read a cover letter addressed directly to a colleague in Human Resources than read a cover letter addressed to ‚ÄúDear Hiring Manager.‚Äù
The very first sentence should tell me why you‚Äôre writing me ‚Äî even if you‚Äôre applying through an online job portal. Include the name of the job, and tell me that you might be a great fit.
But for crying out loud, don‚Äôt tell me you are a perfect fit. Compare the above with this:
Let me make that decision, okay? That‚Äôs my job.
Here‚Äôs another thing I don‚Äôt want to read:
I already know that you‚Äôre looking for a job, and your passion and/or talent will come through in your portfolio. I don‚Äôt need to hear about it here.
Then, tell me a) that you‚Äôve read the job description, and b) how your experience matches my needs.
There it is: your two-sentence opening paragraph. As a hiring manager, I now know the following:
Let‚Äôs move on.
Don‚Äôt tell me about your personality. And don‚Äôt tell me what you will do; tell me what you‚Äôve already done.
Alternatively:
I once received a cover letter that was likely intended to demonstrate the candidate‚Äôs commitment to best practices, but sadly, came across as preachy. It was a list of ‚Äúmusts‚Äù and it went something like this:
It‚Äôs nice that you‚Äôre committed to best practices, but you‚Äôve just told me that you‚Äôre too rigid to work for me. I work at a startup, and we all need to flex on best practices sometimes.
Also, you‚Äôve just told me that you‚Äôll get frustrated if we don‚Äôt design mobile-first. Maybe there‚Äôs no mobile use case for the product; does your ‚Äúmust‚Äù still hold true? I don‚Äôt think so.
Something like this:
So there you go: a cover letter that is short, clear, humble, and focused on what the hiring manager cares about. If a hiring manager takes the time to read cover letters, this will set you apart from the crowd.

Tom Hall|3.6K|11|https://uxplanet.org/how-to-choose-a-user-research-method-985112051d84?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|How to choose a user research method ‚Äì UX Planet|"‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your process?‚Äù
This is a question that you‚Äôll often get from prospective clients, or in an interview for a UX design position. Of course, your exact process will end up being at least a little bit different for just about any UX design project you undertake. Whatever your full answer may be, as I recently wrote, user research has to be a part of that process. In most cases, you just can‚Äôt afford not to do it.
What‚Äôs less clear is what kind of user research you should do. There are a lot of different techniques to choose from, each with different strengths, weaknesses, and research goals. This article is intended to give a quick rundown of how to decide on what your research goals are, and what techniques you can use to achieve those goals.
The most important question to ask yourself before deciding on what research methods to use is: What do I want to know?
How do you go about answering that question? You could start by asking yourself why you want to learn that thing. Identify what you already know about your users, and what you don‚Äôt know about them. What are your knowledge gaps? Some examples of useful questions that you may or may not already know the answers to:
Once you know what you‚Äôre trying to learn, you can start thinking about how to learn it.
One way to break down the methods, suggested by Christian Rohrer, is on two axes: Attitudinal vs. Behavioural studies, and Qualitative vs. Quantitative studies. In attitudinal studies, you‚Äôre trying to find out what people say about a subject, while in behavioural studies, you‚Äôre analyzing what people are actually doing. Qualitative methods tend to be stronger for answering ‚Äúwhy‚Äù types of questions, while quantitative methods do a better job of answering questions like ‚Äúhow many‚Äù and ‚Äúhow much‚Äù.
For example, if you‚Äôre asking the question: ‚ÄúHow many users give up partway through our sign up process?‚Äù, then you might want to consider a more quantitative, behavioural study.
Tomer Sharon has offered a different framework for categorizing research questions, which I‚Äôve found very useful. He suggested that there are broadly three types of questions that UX research is helpful for answering:
You need to understand what your product should be doing (the needs and wants of users) before worrying about whether the product is doing that thing correctly (usability).
So, which techniques can you use to answer each question type? I‚Äôm going to break some of them down below. This is by no means an exhaustive list of user research techniques, and some of these techniques could be used to answer more than one of the question types, but nevertheless it should provide a good starting point.
A quick aside: Before starting any user research project, it‚Äôs important to keep a couple of things in mind:
Also called observation, or a site visit, contextual inquiry involves studying people as they go about their everyday lives or tasks. If you‚Äôre performing a contextual inquiry study on engineers who produce intelligent piping and instrumentation diagrams, you would go to their office and watch an engineer go about their job. Have them show you how they do things. Ask them questions such as ‚ÄúHow do you do that?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan you show me how you did that?‚Äù to try to dig more deeply into how they‚Äôre accomplishing their tasks.
Take notes about what they‚Äôre doing, what difficulties they face, and your own thoughts on it all. You want to try and get into their head to help understand their needs and expectations, but try not to interrupt them more than necessary. As much as possible, you should be trying to observe what would they typically do to accomplish their tasks.
I‚Äôm going to lump ethnographic research in here as well. Ethnographic research tends to focus more on social groups and how they collaborate or interact together, but it has a lot of overlap with contextual inquiry and can be useful for answering some similar types of questions.
In user interviews, you‚Äôll typically meet with users, one at a time, and ask them questions relevant to your project. Usually this is done quite early in the process, and it can be useful for reviewing your product goals. You need practice to get good at interviewing users. Questions often have to be asked in the right way to get good responses, you have to know when to follow up and dig in to an answer, and you have to be able to listen well. You should definitely have an interview protocol or script prepared beforehand.
Remember that during an interview, users can often make up an opinion that they don‚Äôt actually feel strongly about. They can also talk a lot about things that don‚Äôt actually matter to them, which can be misleading.
One technique that can help with this is called the critical incident technique. Your interview subjects may remember some specific cases where the product worked particularly well or poorly, and can often provide more vivid details about these incidents. You can use this to get an idea of the strengths and weaknesses of your product when it comes to helping users accomplish their tasks.
You can also use interviews to help you identify questions to ask in a broader questionnaire or survey. On the other hand, you can use interviews after you‚Äôve seen the results of a questionnaire and want to dive into some of those questions more deeply.
Surveys and questionnaires can provide you with some answers similar to what you‚Äôd get from user interviews. The downside is that you don‚Äôt have the ability to dive more deeply into those answers as there‚Äôs no direct interaction with the users. On the plus side, they allow you to get a larger volume of responses, which can open up the opportunity for more quantitative analysis.
Just like in user interviews, you need to be careful about how you‚Äôre writing your questions. You‚Äôll want to keep the survey as short as you can while still getting the information that you want; if the survey is too long, you may find that you don‚Äôt get as many responses as you‚Äôd like. Surveys can be relatively inexpensive to run, and there are a lot of survey tools out there to choose from.
A diary study can be used to see what users do and how they interact with your product over a longer time frame. Diary studies can often be used as a follow up to a contextual inquiry or an interview, to get some additional information from some of the more engaged and informative users that you encountered.
In some cases you may ask users to take photos, scrapbook, or other similar activities. You have to make sure that you give the users good instructions so that they‚Äôre clear on what they should be doing, and follow up with them at certain intervals to try to keep them engaged.
In A/B testing, you create two variations of an element of your product, such as a registration form. The variations could be represented by anything from a simple paper prototype to a live website. You then define a metric that will measure the success of each variation that you‚Äôve created. For example, you could measure the bounce rate or the NPS of a landing page.
Next, you run an experiment with users where one group sees ‚ÄúVersion A‚Äù and another group sees ‚ÄúVersion B‚Äù. Using the metric you defined, you‚Äôll measure which version was more successful. That‚Äôs the one the users want. You can do this process with more than just two variations, in which case it‚Äôs called multivariate testing.
You can use A/B testing to examine a wide variety of things, such as:
A/B testing is an excellent and powerful user research tool. There‚Äôs a lot of nuance to doing an A/B test correctly, so make sure you‚Äôre designing your study appropriately and that you‚Äôve brushed up on concepts like statistical significance so you know when to stop the study.
The idea behind rapid prototyping is to get your designs in front of users early and often. Rapid prototyping is done iteratively, in a three-step process:
The more you can do this early on, the less you‚Äôll (ideally) need to make changes during development, when it can be far more expensive.
The fidelity of your prototypes can vary. You might start out with paper, and end up with pixel-perfect high-fidelity mockups. In some cases you might even use some live code.
If you‚Äôre going the paper route, you can put together a sketching kit and start drawing. You can use products like UI Stencils to give you a head start if you feel like you can‚Äôt draw particularly well. You can also use an app like Marvel to make your sketches interactive.
Paper prototypes allow you to test your designs quickly, cheaply, and easily. If you have a real budget crunch, this can be a good way to go. However, it‚Äôs worth keeping in mind that it can be distracting for users if your prototype is too low fidelity. Jake Knapp actively discourages paper prototyping with users, saying that:
Depending on your skill level with your design tool(s) of choice, you might be able to jump directly to high fidelity prototypes. Whichever direction you take, the important thing is to get prototypes in front of users, learn from how they respond to it, and iterate.
Of course, this isn‚Äôt always going to be possible, as some systems are just very difficult to prototype. At ThinkUX, we worked on a VR project where we simply weren‚Äôt able to meaningfully prototype and test some parts of the system before implementing them in code.
I could easily write an entire article about the pitfalls of focus groups. There‚Äôs no shortage of such articles out there. Among the primary issues with focus groups are observer dependency, which is when the researcher reads their own feelings into the results of the group discussion. There‚Äôs also groupthink, and the fact that some particularly vocal members of the group can make it seem like there‚Äôs a consensus even when some quieter members of the group disagree. Further, it‚Äôs worth emphasizing once again that there can be a significant difference between what people say and what they do.
However, when done correctly, focus groups can uncover a lot of very useful information. One of the most interesting results can be discovering a customer language that can help you to understand and describe similar experiences that your users shared. Having a group of users together can also help them to jog memories and ideas in each other that they may not have otherwise remembered.
According to the Nielsen Norman Group, if you do only one type of user research on your project, it should be qualitative usability testing. In usability testing, you recruit some users, come up with a list of tasks for the users to accomplish, and set them loose on your system (or prototype). You can do this formally (create a screener, schedule participants, have them come into your lab, record the session, etc.), or with guerilla usability tactics.
You should test with approximately 5 users, as beyond that you‚Äôll start to see diminishing returns. At the conclusion of a usability test, you‚Äôll often find that parts of your design worked, but that users uncovered problems that you‚Äôd never have thought of, and a lot of things need to be tweaked or reworked. This is why it‚Äôs so important to test your designs with real people.
Card sorting is a technique that can help a lot with your information architecture. Write down the major features or topics for your system on cards, then recruit some users and ask them to organize the cards into categories that make sense to them. You can do open sorting, where participants put the cards into groups and then name the groups themselves, or closed sorting, where you give them defined categories to sort the cards into. The results of a card sorting study can help you to decide the structure of your website, how to label your menus, how to group your content, and so on.
Card sorting can be done in person with index cards, or using an online tool such as Optimal Sort. If you‚Äôre doing the study in person, the most difficult part will likely be analyzing the results, particularly if you‚Äôve recruited a large number of participants.
You‚Äôll typically recruit more users for a card sorting study than with a usability test, but don‚Äôt go overboard here as you‚Äôll tend to get diminishing returns beyond 15 or so users.
Tree testing is another research technique that will help you to assess the information architecture of your product. It can (and likely should) be used along with a card sort. Tree testing helps you to answer questions like:
In a tree test, users navigate the site to complete tasks (e.g. ‚Äúbuy a sweatshirt‚Äù) using only links ‚Äî the user interface is stripped away entirely. If, through previous research, you‚Äôve found that users aren‚Äôt reaching an important page on your website, a tree test can help you to determine if the issue is caused by a problem with your information architecture or by something to do with your UI.
At the end of the study, you‚Äôll end up with metrics such as task success rate, failure rate, time to complete the task, and what routes users took through the site tree before selecting an answer (correctly or incorrectly).
Before you can decide on what research techniques you‚Äôre going to employ, you need to figure out what you‚Äôre trying to learn, and why you want to learn it.
Again, this is not an exhaustive list of UX research techniques. There are a lot of different ways to attack a given problem, but this article should help give you some idea of what techniques you can use in your research, and what kinds of questions they can help you to answer.

This article provides general guidelines to design a better form.
A typical form has 5 main components:
Keep questions in an intuitive sequence ‚Äî they should be asked logically from a user‚Äôs perspective, not from the application or database‚Äôs perspective. Usually, asking for a users address before their name would be unexpected.
A form is a conversation, and like any conversation, it should be represented by a logical communication. Group related information into logical blocks or sets. The flow from one set or block help better resemble a conversation and will help users make sense of the information they must fill in.
One of the problems with form fields in multiple columns is that your users are likely to interpret the fields inconsistently. When you use a two-column layout, you introduce the possibility of different interpretations. The most common among users is to scan in Z patterns, slowing the speed of comprehension and obscuring the path to completion. However, if a form is in a single column, the path to completion is a straight line down the page.
Below you‚Äôll find 5 different ways to interpret how the form fields relate when they are arranged in a standard two column layout.
Your form should be able to be only accessed and edited with the tab button on the keyboard. You can find detailed requirements for keyboard interaction pattern in W3C‚Äôs Authoring Practices for Design Patterns.
You should provide the appropriate keyboard for text entry, this allows users to fill out forms faster, because they are not required to tap on other keyboards to access text or numbers keyboard.
To achieve good usability you should adjust the width of your form fields so it matches the length of the expected input. Baymard Institute usability study showed that if a field is too long or too short, users start to wonder if they had misunderstood the label. For form fields with a variable input (name or email) length but within a standard average, you should find a suitable width based on the average length of possible inputs. Studies show that those input fields typically range from 18 to 33 characters.
Incorrect input length:
Correct input length:
Input fields with defined boundaries are important for users with mobility impairments and those with cognitive disabilities. The input field can be filled with color, but does not have to be filled.
You should provide a clear visual notification on the input field when a user clicks/taps on it ‚Äî change color, fade in a box, highlight field, zoom-in etc etc.
When users type their input into a field that isn‚Äôt formatted, they will wonder whether they should type the symbols in or not. This uncertainty can cause distress among users and lead them to abandon the form. The best way to fix this user experience problem is to use input masks within form fields. Input masks will auto insert the correct format in the field as the user types their input. Users no longer have to worry about which format to use or leaving it out.
Nowadays, the majority of forms are filled out on a touch device. Apple has always recommended 44px by 44px space for buttons as this corresponds roughly to a finger size. However, for longer forms I recommend sizing input fields between 32px and 40px in height.
Often there are parts of the form that are contingent on other parts of the form. On e-commerce sites your billing address might be the same as your shipping address. In this example, it‚Äôs best to hide the delivery address field unless the user specifies that the address is different.
You should always try and avoid optional fields in forms. In the case you use optional fields clearly distinguish which input fields are required. Standard UX design, is to use an asterisk (*) for required fields and the word ‚Äúoptional‚Äù for non-required fields. Limit the form to only 1 or 2 optional fields.
Forgiving format allows user to enter data that may have a variety of valid formats and syntax. On e-commerce sites, be flexible, and design screens that can interpret multiple input formats. This should be applied to credit card information, telephone numbers and zip/postal codes. Allow users to enter them with mixed case, with/with-out spaces, etc. You should also consider forgiving format for telephone numbers if you sell internationally through one site as numbers vary across countries .
Try to anticipate frequently selected items and make data entry easier for the user by providing fields with pre-populated smart default values ‚Äî state, country based on the users zip-code or phone country code based on the users IP address.
With more and more people using mobile screens, anything that can be done to prevent unnecessary typing will improve the user experience and decrease errors. Autocompletion makes this possible by presenting real-time suggestions or completions to help the user finish the form faster and more accurately. Below are 5 design patterns for autocomplete suggestions:
Many forms replace field labels with in-field placeholder text to reduce clutter on the page, but studies have shown that this has many negative implications, such as the ones listed below:
A solution for placeholder text within a form is too provide adaptive placeholders. In this pattern, labels are placed within the form field as placeholders but when a user clicks or taps on the input field, the placeholder label moves to the top of the field.
Labels are central to good form design but there are many views on where to position them. Studies show that forms are scanned faster if the labels are on top of the fields. Another advantage of placing the label above the field ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt take too much horizontal space, which allows the label and the users input field to extend the full width of display especially on mobile phones that have a limited estate. However, when the phone is in landscape mode, you should consider repositioning field labels to be left-aligned due to the extreme loss of page content cause the large keyboard when the phone is in landscape mode.
Fonts need to be legible. You should use at least 14 pixels for body copy, 16 pixels is safe for most fonts. On iOS devices if you use a font size of 16 pixels for input fields, iOS will not zoom in further when you tap a field, because it is not necessary.
The label color should meet appropriate contrast ratios. According to the WCAG, the contrast ratio between text and a text‚Äôs background should be at least 4.5 to 1. This is an important usability requirement that helps users with low vision, color blindness, or worsening vision see and read the text on your screen.
Google Material design suggests to limit your selection of colors to three hues from the primary palette and one accent color from the secondary palette.
But if you have your colors chosen you can use WebAIM‚Äôs Color Contrast Checker, to test colors you have already chosen and see if they meet color contrast guidelines.
You should never use all caps, or else the labels would be difficult to read and much harder to quickly scan. UPPERCASE text is harder to read because the outline shapes of all the uppercase letters are rectangular, making them indistinguishable at a glance.
In todays digital world, there are two ways to capitalize words:
Evidence shows that sentence case is a better user experience because its slightly easier to scan and is less likely to be used inconsistently as oppose to title case. There is also a trend towards minimal capitalization for publishing on government and university sites.
Automatically capitalize the first letter in certain input fields such as user‚Äôs name, you don‚Äôt want users doing extra work.
Provide a visual difference between primary and secondary buttons to help minimize the risk for potential errors and help direct users toward a successful outcome.
Color is very important in buttons, it help users navigate and understand the action more clearly. For users suffering from colorblindness you should never use red and green together, choose either green OR red for a call to action ‚Äî but never both.
Buttons should be rectangular with rounded corners. Studies show that these buttons perform best because the rounded corners draw attention to the inside of the button as they point inwards. While from a psychology standpoint we‚Äôve evolved to stay away from anything with sharp corners as they represent a threat of injury.
Based on MIT Touch Lab Study, the averages finger pads are between 10‚Äì14mm and fingertips are 10mm x10mm, making it a good minimum touch target size.
You should place your button in the users path, the buttons need logical placement as to where the user is going to next and how people actually read the page.
Some forms have back buttons so placing a submit button right below the form can cause user to click on it by accident thinking they would go back. Back buttons should be out of sight while submit buttons should be placed on the right side of the page below the form.
Labels indicate the function of each button, add a clear message of what happens after the user clicks on the button. Avoid generic labels like ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù for actions, because they give the impression that the form itself is generic.
Don‚Äôt use a reset button because if the user clicks on it on accident and the entire form is erased they will abandon the form from frustration.
Make sure the buttons look clickable or tappable, shading indicates that it is possible to click. Design the button to clearly indicate the form is being processed after the user‚Äôs action, this helps prevent double submission.
In form entry validation, there are three main trends:
The last method is used less since its not a good user experience and the most preferred is real-time inline validation, because it can help users complete forms more quickly and with less effort, and fewer errors. Inline validation forms provide real-time feedback as people fill in the fields, using lightweight and direct success messages (green checkmarks) and error messages (red triangles and text) next to the form input fields. Inline validation also makes it easier to pick unique usernames and other such inputs.
It is a good practice to provide both a general error message, and a field specific one. One of the 10 Usability Heuristics states that it‚Äôs important to provide both an error that‚Äôs in viewport as well as field specific explanations about what‚Äòs wrong with the inputted data. Error messaging should have the following:
Colorblindness affects approximately 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women in the world. Your form should not only rely on color to indicate fields with (red) and without (green) an error. Instead use color in combination with visual cues or inline messages which helps indicate fields with error.
Like inline validation is helpful for users, provide validation that the form has been submitted successfully.

Jasper Stephenson|6.9K|5|https://uxdesign.cc/the-spectrum-of-digital-design-roles-in-2018-3286390a9966?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|The spectrum of design roles in 2018 ‚Äì UX Collective|"Recently, a colleague of mine named Mariko Sugita needed to hire a designer for a website she was creating. She‚Äôs an urbanist, and not particularly involved in the digital design field, so she asked the closest designer who happened to be on hand (me), ‚Äúwhat kind of designers should I be looking for?‚Äù
I thought for a moment and realized that I had several possible answers, none of which quite summed up the full scope of roles that are present in our field today and what each designer‚Äôs assumed title really says about their abilities.
That started me thinking about what exactly the spectrum of digital design roles really looks like here in Common Era 2018. I started sketching out my ideas. When Mariko saw my notes for this article, she said, ‚Äúyes, that‚Äôs exactly what I wanted to know beforehand!‚Äù I hope that this overview can be just as useful for you, too. Let‚Äôs begin!
It would be irresponsible to casually lump designers into groups without qualifying that no two designers are the same. I‚Äôm taking a moment here to borrow an idea from a great post by Sam Jarman on dev.to, who in turn got the idea from The Soft Skills Engineering Podcast. The basic concept is that rather than thinking that any person‚Äôs skills are just T-shaped ‚Äî the idea that they have a broad understanding of many things and a deep understanding of one thing ‚Äî their skills are instead better understood as a line of wet paint drawn across canvas.
The paint forms a broad line across the top layer of the canvas, signifying a base level of understanding of many fields, but it also drips down in many places, in different depths, which represent the varying depths of different skills that a designer has. The point is that every designer has varying degrees of ability in different skills based on their experience, whether that‚Äôs vector design, digital prototyping, user research, coding, motion graphics, or anything across the entire creative spectrum. Therefore, the title they call themselves on paper can‚Äôt possibly hope to define their philosophy and scope of experience.
I hear you loud and clear. So, with the knowledge that we will never truly represent the full scope of any one human with a single deterministic title, let‚Äôs try to define some singular, deterministic titles.
All sarcasm aside, here begins an honest look (in my own, personal opinion) at what kind of design roles are generally being seen out there in the wild.
‚ÄúBut Jasper, you just finished saying that T-shaped designers don‚Äôt exist!‚Äù Yes, I did. And they don‚Äôt. But if you want to laser focus in on hiring a person to do a specific thing for you, you might as well find someone who describes themselves as a specialist. You can usually count on someone who goes by one of these titles to do that specific task at a very high level of quality.
Also, yes, I put front-end developers on a chart about designers. There‚Äôs enough blurring of the line between designer and developer these days that I feel like it‚Äôs important to have a baseline of where the full-time devs stand on the spectrum.
One note on reading these charts: the upper line of a role represents the common breadth of that role, while the shade beneath represents varying depths of ability along the spectrum.
Here we start to blur some lines into generalized roles, especially the role of UX Designer which I‚Äôve seen take on an incredible breadth of definitions in the past few years. These tend to serve more as catch-all terms, and it‚Äôs not always easy to be sure what a designer going by this title is skilled in. This is where portfolios and interviews can back up a vague title with solid examples of what exactly this designer brings to the table and how strong their skills are on visuals, implementation, and ideation.
These are the ones who can do it all, but they have to spread their knowledge and expertise across multiple fields in order to do it. Often people in this category got there by necessity ‚Äî maybe they worked at startups that demanded they perform roles outside their expertise, or they had personal projects where they had to cover all the bases themselves.
Some designers are quick to naysay the possibility of one person being a master in several fields simultaneously. I tend to think that those with exceptional experience or talent can tackle the challenge, especially because they tend to understand the full scope of the roles around them better than other designers. It‚Äôs a matter of understanding that this designer brings breadth over specificity to the table, and helping them succeed accordingly.
So, if we put all three of those together, what does it look like?
Kind of a mess. But an understandable one, hopefully.
Did I help you figure out what type of designer to look for for your project? Did I mislabel your role or miss it entirely? Let me know in the comments!

They are the best source of user interaction. User provides his information and input through forms and system interprets this information to fulfill user requests.
Two important input controls are radio buttons and drop-down menus. Both of them can be used interchangeably when an input is required from user.
However, if we study about the usability of these controls, it becomes apparent that radio buttons and drop-downs should be used in certain scenarios to make it easier for user to select a given input.
Below are few rules based on this usability study that will help you to decide about one of these controls while designing a form.
There can be multiple cases where you want to emphasize options:
In example, using a drop-down menu does not seem good as default option does not give a clue about other options.
Lesser options are good to place side by side so that:
It is better to use radio buttons when user has to select from 2 to 4 options, as shown in example.
Comparable options are good to place side by side because:
A good example above is about selection of subscription plan where user has to make a serious decision.
Clear visibility and quick scan of options is more understandable for user.
It is obvious from given example that long forms provide good user experience when all select-able options are visible to user.
Viewing only the recommended option makes easier for user to decide the selection because:
In example, there is no need to display all options as here is lesser chance for user to change the default option.
Large number of familiar options are encouraged to display in drop-down because:
Large number of options are not good to display side by side because:
Also, for a long drop-down, it is a good practice to provide a text box where user can type the option name and list displays filtered options only. This makes selection easier and quicker.
To enhance form‚Äôs user experience, it is very important to provide correct controls to take user‚Äôs input. Since forms can be very long with large number of options, it becomes tedious for user if he has to make extra clicks to fill his information. The given set of rules will help you to decide between two controls, radio buttons and drop-down menus, while designing your forms.

Every month I reflect on ‚ÄòHow I can be a better Designer‚Äô. I learned through my background in visual arts that you can train yourself to draw better in a shorter period of time (literally).
I experimented with this in the Summer of 2013. My goal then was to achieve realistic sketches of eyes that captured human emotion. To do this I gave myself a 30-minute time limit and these were the results...
This technique can be applied to design as well ‚Äî I found that great ideas don‚Äôt always require a lot of time. We want to reduce our own tendencies to overthink, agonize and get distracted from the problem in front of us.
I like to describe rapid prototyping as not just wireframes.
What you see at the end of a rapid prototyping session are wireframes that you can use to demonstrate the idea but within these ‚Äòwireframes‚Äô are solutions.
I was once asked by a UX Designer ‚Äòhow I show my design thinking‚Äô. He found it difficult to show employers how he thinks about design since compared to UI, design thinking can‚Äôt be physically seen.
My answer: sketches and rapid prototyping shows others how you think through problems. Your solutions should come to you through sketching, feedback and multiple design iterations.. that‚Äôs where the story is told. It just depends on how you read it. Like good UX ‚Äî the true power of the UX process is hidden. This is where we can train ourselves to think fast, seek validation and refine our own design process.
The premise of this method is to sketch for 8 minutes, 6 minutes, 4 minutes and 2 minutes with quick 2 minute feedback sessions in between.
I learned about this method in my post-grad program. I‚Äôve only realized recently that exercises like these have made it almost natural to incorporate feedback into everything I design. Being open to feedback helps you keep your designs in check by making you aware of things you may not have thought about ‚Äî the ‚Äúunknown unknowns‚Äù (Donald Rumsfeld).
For example: Pizza and Geolocation ‚Äî Pizza on the fly or geocaching for pizza slices... The idea is to practice coming up with ideas on the spot and screens based on how a potential user would navigate through the application. It‚Äôs best to have someone next to you to ask for feedback!
The 3 words I chose were:
I visited the Sagrada FamiÃÅlia in Barcelona, May of 2016. I remember waiting in the line and upon reaching the entrance I was handed this clunky device with plastic headphones ‚Äî they call it the ‚ÄúAudioguide‚Äù.
The idea for my application was to have a Near Field Communication (NFC) sticker (1) at various historical site (2) locations. These stickers function like Android or Apple Pay where an application or website opens up on your phone in close range. When you tap your mobile device at a historical site location, you would have access to an audio tour right from your phone. The geolocation (3) feature would allow you to select historical sites nearby and generates an itinerary for you.
Feedback: To consider adding filters to the historical sites by distance, include descriptions and reviews.
Maybe you‚Äôre like me and you‚Äôve received the congratulatory email on Day 100 üéâ with nothing to show for it. This was the simple twist I added to get myself started.
If you want to go one step further ‚Äî set up a Skype date with a friend to make sure that the both of you would have something to show at the end of the hour. Win-win.
Take a moment in your day-to-day to note down real world problems that you wish there were better solutions for. You might already a list or two or five. It‚Äôs time to solve that problem.
By practicing these rapid prototyping exercises you can train yourself to think through solutions faster and to always validate your ideas.

Chris Kiess|3.5K|15|https://blog.prototypr.io/confessions-of-a-ux-designer-2dda9e1758a1?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|Confessions of a UX Designer ‚Äì Prototypr|"I‚Äôm about to commit a cardinal sin against the gods of UX in penning this article. My design soul will likely suffer eternal damnation. And, like Judas Iscariot, I‚Äôll be forever haunted by the sound of thirty pieces of silver rattling about in my pocket. Forgive me father, for I am about to sin...and I have sinned.
After more than a decade of projects gone afoul, designs that never made it to development, concepts that should have never made it beyond being a concept and the snail‚Äôs pace of many projects I have worked on, this article is long overdue. I‚Äôd like to be able to write an article placing the blame somewhere other than the UX teams I have worked with. But, that wouldn‚Äôt be honest or true. It wouldn‚Äôt be a confession. Often times, it has been my team or myself to blame for failed projects or projects that could have yielded better results.
At the outset, I must state there is a lot I like and love about UX and design in general. But, there is also a lot that gets under my skin. UX can be a great solution to the problems an organization faces with their products in the market. But, UX can also be part of the problem. I have often become part of the problem.
In life, I have generally found solutions do not come without cost. You often solve one problem and create another. I have seen the same thing happen with UX design in organizations. We solve a lot of problems when introduced to an organization, but often create more via our very existence.
So, I‚Äôm ‚Äúbreaking bad‚Äù with UX. Specifically, I‚Äôm outlining the mistakes I have made and have seen teams make ‚Äî mistakes that inhibit the final product and user‚Äôs experience. In parallel, I am pushing against some of the dogmatic philosophies inherent in our profession. This article is where I see UX go awry. It‚Äôs also a short list of things that irk me about the profession. This is an article about flouting the maxims, thinking for yourself and sometimes, just sometimes, going against the crowd‚Äôs conventional thinking.
Paradoxically, these are all transgressions I have committed in my own past. My sins. These are the confessions of a UX designer.
I don‚Äôt know how my mind dysfunctions. But most of the time when someone gives me a rule, I automatically question it or try to break it. This isn‚Äôt always true. Early in my career, I would follow the rules of UX to a tee. I didn‚Äôt know any better and was too green to have experiences where the rules didn‚Äôt work or to know they weren‚Äôt applicable to the situation.
We‚Äôre designers. We are thinkers. Rules are little more than cognitive offload. Now, I am not suggesting there aren‚Äôt any good design rules or there are not any rules you should follow in UX design. I am merely suggesting we think before we mindlessly follow a design rule.
Here are just a few UX rules you can find in a quick search:
The rules above are less rules than guidelines. Consistency for the sake of being consistent is simply being stupid as I point out below. There is a time to use fake copy and a time not to. Fake copy can actually be advantageous in circumstances when you don‚Äôt want the content to get in the way. It is generally true that you are not the user. However, there are research methods where being the user is appropriate and adds another point of data to your research. It‚Äôs called immersion. And, research of any type is only one point of data. Users do not always tell you what they need nor know what they need. And the seven plus or minus two rule is a classic example of a research study being misinterpreted or, as even Edward Tufte puts it, not read.
It seems like every week or month, a new trend starts in our profession and shortly thereafter, it will become our ‚Äúgolden calf‚Äù until it‚Äôs forgotten or the next new thing comes along. I get tired of rules ‚Äî especially when they are mindlessly followed. I got tired of following the rules and realizing they don‚Äôt always work.
Designers don‚Äôt follow rules all of the time. In fact, they often break rules to create ingenious designs. This, of course, comes with experience. Design is part art and part science. And, great art often breaks rules.
About once or twice per year, I notice an uptick in the UX community on a certain topic. A few people come across an idea or concept in an article or perhaps a presentation at a conference and slowly you‚Äôll see a larger group running to jump on the bandwagon. A few years ago, the hamburger icon became one of those topics.
The basic essence of the argument against the hamburger icon cited low discoverability, lack of recognition and lack of engagement in A/B testing, making a case users just didn‚Äôt understand or use the hamburger icon. Ultimately, the demonization of the hamburger icon was a bit of a boring argument and was based on some pretty weak studies. It ignored the fact that an icon becomes an icon through its pervasive presence. An icon is a language. It‚Äôs a symbol representing a concept just like a letter represents a sound.
Nevertheless, a good percentage of the profession jumped on the bandwagon and demonized the hamburger icon. Lean UX was another trend a few years ago and despite trying to move our profession out of the ‚Äúdeliverable business,‚Äù a brief internet search will quickly reveal we‚Äôre still in the deliverable business with plenty of writings on UX deliverables.
Mobile design is probably my favorite example. This is where teams chase that shiny object and employ a technology simply because it is there. I have been on numerous mobile design initiatives that were complete failures. Hell, even I thought some of them were a good idea at some point. But, I have been burnt so many times that I now scrutinize any proposal for a mobile design with extra vigilance. Just because you can put your design or product on a mobile device doesn‚Äôt mean it should be on one. It‚Äôs a trend teams like to embrace because all the other monkeys are doing it too. Monkey see, monkey do.
If you spend a lot of time surfing the net and regurgitating the last article you read on a specific topic (like I spent so many years doing), you‚Äôll quickly find it isn‚Äôt much different from the current fashion you are wearing. About 5‚Äì10 years from now, you‚Äôll look back at a picture of you sporting those new pants and the shirt you thought was so cool only to laugh at how dated you look. The UX bandwagon is no different. Five years from now, you‚Äôll no longer believe even so much as half of what the current rage in our profession is.
Some trends will stay in our profession. Those are usually theories based on sound foundational principles ‚Äî the principles of our profession from decades of research and application. They‚Äôre like 501 Levis and a solid print t-shirt. They‚Äôll never go out of style. But, most trends will fall by the wayside. Following them will often lead you and your project astray.
As a general rule of thumb: Stay off the bandwagon, stray from the crowd and step to the beat of your own music ‚Äî no matter how measured or far away. And as for those trending concepts that do stick around or seem to hold some validity ‚Äî make sure you aren‚Äôt adopting them just because everyone else is. Don‚Äôt build a mobile app for a user base who would benefit more from a desktop application. Don‚Äôt adopt an idea based on an article you read citing a weak study or misrepresenting a study. In short, critically and strategically evaluate the concepts you add to your repertoire.
I don‚Äôt know if it is a UX designer personality trait to be pedantic and detail-oriented. I don‚Äôt think so because I know a lot of designers who aren‚Äôt. But, I‚Äôve never encountered a profession where discussions over minute details go on ad nauseam and occasionally even stop a project.
Yes, the little things count. I concede to that. And when you have the time and resources to address the little things, you should. But what I see far too often is UX teams coming unglued over the little things while they ignore the larger problems. It‚Äôs as though the house is on fire and we‚Äôre worried about the storage shed in the backyard.
I‚Äôve had long discussions over toggle switches versus checkboxes, radio buttons versus drop menus, rounded versus square corners, save dialogs with multiple options, colors, button placement, grids and more. Long discussions. Discussions lasting weeks or months. Email threads longer than the arms and legs of an NBA All-Star.
There is an appropriate use and there are guidelines for each of these examples. And sure, if you have the time, money and resources to entertain the finer details in a design, then have at it. But if you have bigger fish to fry, your resources and energies are better placed elsewhere.
But, here is where I always land: Does it truly impact the user experience? Does the user really care whether the corners are rounded? Will that impact their experience? Do they care if all of your components snap to a grid? I‚Äôve spent a lot of time in the field on various projects and it is rare I find a user who comments on some aspect of a feature I had discussed ad nauseam with my team. It‚Äôs usually something I never even thought of that turns out to be problematic ‚Äî something we should have spent more time discussing, but didn‚Äôt.
I confess to being sucked into this in the past and even recently. I‚Äôll get into these discussions (most of them surrounding the visual aspects of an interface) and they‚Äôll go on forever. We‚Äôll set up a small team to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù these issues or test a group of users. But at some point, I‚Äôll be sitting there while the discussion drones on and think about how this really impacts the overall design. Usually, it doesn‚Äôt and has very little impact on the user experience from a holistic perspective.
Always ask yourself this one question: Is this an issue, given all of the other issues I have to address, that will impact the user?
Consistency is important. But, I firmly believe the law of diminishing returns comes into play with consistency. How much time are you willing to spend with each screen to ensure absolute consistency? Time is money and will that time spent give you a good ROI?
Obviously, if you have a total lack of consistency between screens and the system doesn‚Äôt even look the same from one screen to the next, it will cause a myriad of problems. But if you are a few pixels off on button sizing from one screen to the next, will this truly impact the user experience? It‚Äôs sloppy design, absolutely. But, it won‚Äôt kill the product on release.
I‚Äôm not suggesting we ignore consistency or the little details I note above. I am only proposing a fair balance between the energy we spend on these things and the return on our investment. If you are working with Atomic Design in a large system, how much upfront work will you do versus the time you will save in designing and amending the design? If it is done right, you can probably reap a greater return on your investment. But at some point, the law of diminishing returns will take effect.
Consistency must also be contextually dependent. Consider a search component in a system. Let‚Äôs suppose you define how search should work and then state it should work the same throughout the entire system you are designing. This seems logical right? We would want search to work the same across a system and not trip the user up by switching up the functionality. The only problem with this is we have now prioritized consistency (as a primary heuristic) over the user experience.
Wait a minute, you might ask. Aren‚Äôt heuristics supposed to support the user experience? Yes. When they are used as a guide or rule of thumb they do. When they are strictly applied they may not. In the search example, a different search functionality could be warranted in different parts of a system depending on how complex the search needs to be, how many results may be returned and the size of the database being searched.
Don‚Äôt fall into the trap I have fallen into where you have screens taped up on every wall and spend weeks or months going through them with a fine-toothed comb to gain consistency. This often evolved into a major effort for me and upon release, I discovered larger items I could have been managing instead.
The context of the user‚Äôs experience should be prioritized over consistency. Component or symbol consistency in a system should not become so rigid it does not afford the opportunity to design for the context in which the user is employing that functionality. Being consistent for the sake of being consistent is often just one more way to not use your brain when designing for the user experience.
This may be more of an organizational problem than a UX problem. But, almost every team I have worked with over the course of my career has allowed themselves to be sucked into the release cycle ‚Äî including myself. Yes, you have to release a product and you have to set a deadline that will allow your team to build a product with the time and resources you have. But when the focus is solely on the deadline at the expense of building a great experience and product, you have essentially sold your soul to the company store. Don‚Äôt let the deadline be the spurs that drive you forward.
I have rarely seen a project make its deadline. It happens ‚Äî but not very often. That means there is room to play with a project timeline (since they are usually poor projections driven by financial concerns and put in place by projects managers who don‚Äôt understand the complexities involved in a feature or product). This means you do have the time for that research you wanted to squeeze in or that next iteration of the design.
Yet, this is really about where our focus lies and what we end up chasing in the process of building a product and experience. We often become so focused on deadlines, milestones and release dates, we forget what our true mission is. Nothing annoys me more than a project manager at my desk suggesting we aren‚Äôt going to make a milestone or deadline and we‚Äôll be red-flagged as a result. The deadline is not the goal.
In my case, I have to constantly remind myself I am working on a patient experience. That is my ‚Äúprimary directive.‚Äù I am not showing up each morning to make a deadline for the next sprint. That goal is secondary. My highest loyalty must be to the patient experience.
Here‚Äôs the rub: You can meet the deadline, make all the bean counters and project managers happy and still build a shit product. I‚Äôve done this. I have run the whole race and crossed the wrong finish line a number of times in my career. It‚Äôs not a win. It‚Äôs me sitting at the finish line wondering how in the hell I ended up here.
Stop focusing on the deadline and put your sights on the user experience. Make sure you are running in the right race and on the right track.
If I have to listen to one more debate over design tools and how one tool is better than another, I think I might hang myself by one of my unworn neckties. I had the displeasure of working with a consulting team not too long ago who had the audacity to suggest using one tool would give our team a competitive advantage in the future workforce. Such rubbish. I don‚Äôt know if they were getting kickbacks or if they had just drank too much of their own Kool-Aid.
I grew up with a mechanic ‚Äî my father. (He‚Äôs really more of a mechanical engineer than a mechanic.) But, I always remember all of the tools he had ‚Äî some of which I didn‚Äôt even know what they did. There was a set of tools for every job. I learned by watching him and riding along on his trips to the Sears Craftsman store when he would need some special item. UX is no different. A design tool has a specific purpose and needs to fit the job.
Some tools are better for prototyping and others are better for visual design. You can‚Äôt beat a whiteboard and dry-erase marker to get ideas down quickly. A lot of our choices are very subjective. And, if there is any profession that should know how personal and subjective this choice is, it should be UX.
The mark of an experienced and rational designer is knowing which tool to use in which scenario. Religiosity around tools is simply dogma with no real scientific basis underlying these claims. So, stop sending tweets and writing articles debating which tool is better. If you want to make a useful contribution to the profession, write an article about a design tool‚Äôs features and how you used it in a project to solve a specific problem creating a kick-ass experience.
No one ever actually says it. But, the attitude is often evident even if unspoken. It‚Äôs often territorial. We wouldn‚Äôt want anyone infringing on our space or replacing us, right? It‚Äôs this attitude only those formally trained (or those who hold a job title with UX in it) can design.
We‚Äôve all been there. A business analyst or a developer shows up to your desk with a rough sketch of an idea they have. And, many of us have turned our nose up to these people ‚Äî effectively ostracizing them from our privileged ranks. Who are they to propose a potential solution? I‚Äôve done this and was once a UX snob. I didn‚Äôt want anyone to do anything closely resembling my work.
Fortunately, most of us mature a little and realize this is not only a great way to develop a shared understanding, but also a method of increasing collaboration and rapport with other teams. But, I routinely encounter those insecure UX designers who believe anyone with an idea not bearing the title or training of a UX designer should be pushed out of the circle as quickly as possible. This is simply the wrong attitude to have. These are usually the same types of designers who will spend an inordinate amount of time advocating for UX in an organization and wondering why no one wants to work with them.
As controversial as it may seem (and was at the time), Jared Spool stated:
As a designer working in healthcare UX, I have generally found this statement to be true. The design of a product or service is often not rendered as I originally intended, having been influenced by other teams. Is it so far fetched to believe we build and design a product as a team through our shared understanding of what we are attempting to create? I think not.
If you are having trouble advocating for UX in your organization and looking for acceptance, ensure you aren‚Äôt a UX snob. Your career (and designs) will go a long way if you concentrate on building relationships and bringing different viewpoints (via other disciplines) to the table.
UX is an evolving profession. That‚Äôs probably a good thing. Were we steeped in centuries of tradition (like medicine, for example), we‚Äôd probably have a whole different set of problems. But, we are still finding our way. And, we‚Äôre finding our way in a new world where communication can be enabled through the click of a publish button on the web. We are still finding our space in a profession that, once, largely operated without our assistance. And, we are still attempting to figure out how we integrate ourselves into the product development process.
To accomplish what we need to accomplish requires us to understand more than just our profession. It requires us to see a larger picture, to think bigger and to always maintain a center of balance. That center of balance must connect our daily activities to how it impacts the user experience. That impact falls within what we create and it falls beyond our designs as well. Focusing on the wrong details (details that have little or no impact on the user experience), ostracizing ourselves, employing narrow-minded thinking and embracing the latest trends regardless of their foundational validity will do little more than have us designing in circles.
Yet, these are my confessions as well ‚Äî all transgressions I have committed. I have fallen in all of these traps. And though I would like to say I‚Äôll move forward without falling into future traps, I know I will not live without sin. Ten years from now (likely sooner), I will have an entirely new list of confessions to make. I am not alone though. May the gods of UX have mercy on all our souls.

For many of our readers, the New York Times desktop home page is an important and familiar place to connect with the news each day.
It hasn‚Äôt changed much over the last decade, even as the story formats we use, the platforms we support and the ways our readers consume content online have rapidly evolved.
We‚Äôve invested heavily in making our mobile apps expressive and visually dynamic, but our desktop website has lagged behind, powered by a siloed and aging set of tools.
These fractures in workflow and technology have meant our newsroom editors and our engineering teams had to do duplicate work across multiple systems for our mobile apps and our desktop website.
They weren‚Äôt the only ones. Whenever readers switched between devices, they were met with different reading experiences, which made it hard for them to follow their interests and gave them an inconsistent experience with our brand.
In a few weeks, we will update our desktop home page experience as a final step to bringing readers a consistent experience across all of our platforms and screens. Readers who visit us on mobile have already seen many of the changes. But with the desktop rollout, readers will be able to engage with the stories that interest them most on all of the devices they read The New York Times.
We started our home page project with plenty of data about what people chose to do there, but it was more difficult to tell from the numbers why they made those decisions.
As a product and design team, we always want to go beyond what readers say they like and dislike to understand how reading, watching or listening to our stories fits into their lives.
We realized that in order to help our readers go deeper, our team had to engage deeply with our readers. We visited them at their homes and got to know them. Then we asked them broad questions about how the the news fits into their day ‚Äî or doesn‚Äôt.
We came away from those interviews with a better understanding of three major needs our readers wanted to fulfill on our home page:
We also came away with a strategy for how to help our readers meet those needs.
Readers said they wanted us to curate their experience on the home page, but not limit it. We needed a system that empowered them to follow their own interests. At the same time, readers wanted our help to navigate a chaotic world of information overload and filter bubbles.
We used those insights to begin sketching out possible ways to address reader needs that also mapped clearly to our mission and goals.
While we design layouts and custom-made typography with care, we also know what truly makes or breaks the reading experience is the content itself. Our readers told us loud and clear: what matters is access to New York Times journalism.
To test our initial concepts, we needed to see how they would hold up with real news flowing through them. So we created a series of prototypes to gather feedback from a small panel of readers.
Our first round of prototypes were pretty crude. We built them quickly, with the intention of testing our assumptions and threw most of them away after gathering data. We started out with simple paper prototypes. (Our favorite was a cardboard and paper iPhone we nicknamed ‚ÄúThe pPhone.‚Äù)
The more prototypes we built, the more confidence we gained. We knew we probably weren‚Äôt going to get everything right the first time (spoiler: we didn‚Äôt). But we also knew how much we could learn when we got things wrong.
Once we gained confidence through paper prototyping, we moved on to a higher-fidelity web prototype and recruited a few news editors to run it using some bare-bones publishing tools.
While our readers helped articulate the original needs that inspired our designs, our prototype editors were instrumental in stress-testing our concepts. They gave us feedback on how well the stories they wanted to highlight fit into our proposed structure and helped us calibrate what areas of the page needed to be elevated or suppressed.
Having editors join the conversation early on helped us quickly understand what was working and what might be missing. The editors were also candid with us about standard newsroom practices and internal dynamics that we needed to consider. The first time a major story broke, we learned that our system and tools would need maximum flexibility to support a wide variety of news scenarios.
Throughout this design process, many members of our product, design and engineering teams also volunteered to curate the home page for a day to gain first-hand experience of what the home page workflow was like under the constant pressure of breaking news. Embedding directly with our news editors showed that we were committed to making our home page work for them and gave us plenty of empathy for what it takes to produce the home page every day.
By working closely together, we developed a version of the home page that was polished enough for wider distribution. To prepare for a larger-scale rollout to a subset of readers, we worked with our internal tools teams to build more realistic tools that let the newsroom curate the new version of the home page.
While we always planned to launch a fully responsive home page, our early tests left us most confident in our new features at the mobile breakpoint. We solidified and rolled out our changes to all mobile readers in October of last year.
Creating the right layouts to scale our newsroom curation efforts up to more complex desktop and tablet layouts took our team another cycle of iteration. With mobile fully live, we launched our initial desktop concepts to a small percentage of readers, and studied metrics and qualitative survey feedback closely, while making adjustments.
Early in our desktop test, we focused on showing readers the breadth of our coverage. We limited the number of prominent stories at the top of the page and used layouts that highlighted more of our photography. The page layout was airy and encouraged readers to scroll more.
But readers pushed back. While they didn‚Äôt want to be overwhelmed, they were eager to see more related news stories in order to get a complete picture of the day‚Äôs news.
The ratio of photography to information also felt off. In a news cycle where much of our major news came from Washington D.C., the photos of politicians in suits soon felt repetitive and stale from day to day.
In order to give readers a more nuanced picture of the news and editors the flexibility to choose which visual and text elements to highlight, we developed a system of tools and layouts that let editors group a few related stories into a ‚Äústory package.‚Äù
Creating a system for packages that would work across every device and support all of the possible grouping combinations was a complex design and development task, but it ultimately gave us more flexibility to create strong presentations for every news situation.
It also helped the page look more dynamic for readers because there was more depth and density at the top of the page.
We also added visual differentiation between hard news stories and softer features to help readers quickly distinguish between types of content. This provided a better visual rhythm on desktop where stories are frequently displayed side by side.
Our home page update is a significant step forward in helping our readers meet their needs across all of their devices. Our investments in a new technical architecture will make the site faster for readers and more flexible for our teams. We are confident that the system of story groups and packages we‚Äôve created will allow us to continue evolving the experience in ways we can‚Äôt even imagine today. We‚Äôve created a system that‚Äôs rooted in highlighting both what our readers feel is important to read and what they want to read. Best of all, it can grow and adapt as those needs do, too.

Sungjoon Steve Won|2.2K|6|https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-speak-up-impact-conversations-as-a-junior-designer-f868064526c5?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|How to speak up and impact conversations as a junior designer|"A large part of my week is spent in meeting rooms, design critiques, and spontaneous discussions. This was true when I was an individual contributor, and it became increasingly so after I transitioned into a lead role few years back and then into a head of studio role in the beginning of 2017. I have to have every Wednesday fully blocked out so that I can focus on completing tasks on my plate, and I try very hard to keep those days meeting-free as intended.
But I value these meetings, as long as they are kept to be efficient in time and effective in discussion flows. It‚Äôs an opportunity to get your idea out, get feedback, cross-pollinate ideas from everyone, and impact conversations. Sitting in a room full of talented peers and co-workers, it is common to find yourself swimming in a pool overflowing with ideas. These ideas may conflict with each other, and some of them may even conflict with your own. Unless you can speak up and make your points relevant to others, the exchange of these ideas can overwhelm your voice from being heard and even affect what you were working on.
Though this is unfortunate, fewer people may be leaning in by default to hear you out when you are a junior designer or an individual contributor in some meetings. As a result, these situations require you to try harder to get your point across. But whether you are in the room amongst your peers, leads, managers, or directors, you shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to speak up. I‚Äôve thought about what I tried when I was a junior designer, and put together a number of ways that worked for me.
As a junior designer, you may already be fully occupied and perhaps satisfied with solely focusing on completing the design tasks delegated to you by your manager. There isn‚Äôt anything wrong with that, and doing that well may already be handful. However, it is worth taking a step further.
Output from design critiques, weekly sync, and hallway conversations often turns into a set of tasks and action items, some of which will be delegated to you. By speaking up, you can build a sense of ownership to what will come out as the meeting output and increase the chance of working things that align with your point-of-view. Wouldn‚Äôt that be more fulfilling compared to potentially working on something that seem irrelevant to your interests & passion?
The second reason is for growth. Ability to influence others with your ideas becomes more important as you grow into a senior designer and then a lead or manager role. It‚Äôs never too early to start working on ways to do so.
The first step is throwing your opinion out there without hesitation, whether it gets incorporated into the final outcome or not. It is okay to speak up even if it is may be different from other‚Äôs POV (point-of-view) and better if it is clear how your opinion adds a new perspective to the process. The beauty of working together is, the team can look at something from varying perspectives and understand the landscape better before making a decision. Every perspective counts.
Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found useful when
It‚Äôs easy to keep your opinion to yourself and let others discuss among themselves. Even if you don‚Äôt, it feels okay to do so since nothing will fall out of expectations.
Still, speak up. Express and advocate for the other person‚Äôs point-of-view that you relate with. This is an easy opportunity to let others be aware that you have an opinion on the matter and that your perspective counts.
There can be two or more reasons to why you have a different POV from everyone else. Sometimes your idea is just bad. In this case, someone else may also have thought about the same idea and decided not to share it for that reason. Other times, your idea is good but others are not up to speed with you yet. ; You have to be as objective with your ideas as you can be, so you can tell when people aren‚Äôt receptive because the ideas are bad. So, how can you speak up when it is the latter and not the former?
What holds you back from speaking up might be fear of criticism or dismissal.
People on the project like your design, but your manager or project lead isn‚Äôt so sure. Rather than taking the lukewarm response as the answer and putting a halt on your idea, what can you do?
Constructive discussion with your manager is a good thing. But you also don‚Äôt want to appear arguing out of pure stubbornness, nor appear as if you are spending too much time on something that wouldn‚Äôt be valuable to the project. So,
Try these.
Make it a goal to say one thing at every meeting. Whether it‚Äôs big or small, say one thing before you walk out of the meeting room. When you have a butterfly in your stomach during a discussion, that‚Äôs likely a sign that there‚Äôs something you want to share with others. Don‚Äôt think too hard. Just speak up the first thought that crosses your mind.
If you are too shy to speak up verbally, draw out your idea & put it up where everyone in the room can see. Have people start discussing it, and you can naturally join in the conversation and explain how you sketched out your thoughts.
I started writing with the intention of creating a single post, but realized midway that it may be better suited to reorganize them into separate posts. So, part two on the topic under way.
Regardless of your level, it‚Äôs important to speak up when you have an opinion and add your perspective when looking at a given problem, design, or topic. You are already beginning to make impact just by speaking up. It is okay to have a different opinion, but it‚Äôs not okay to stay silent about it. I hope some of the ways that worked for me can be of some help to others. If you have ways that worked for you, I would love to learn about them also.

Florian Gaefke|1.8K|6|https://uxdesign.cc/start-using-real-quotation-marks-in-ui-design-3343ef90d1f2?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|Using real quotation marks in Design ‚Äì UX Collective|"Good typography is nearly invisible and stays gently in the background. Her primary purpose is simply to reproduce the content, to the reader‚Äôs eyes. You could say, most of the time typography is some kind of neutral. Just to understand it right ‚Äî neutral in this context has nothing to do with a stark or even boring looking typeface.
You could even create top-notch typography with a squarish looking sci-fi typeface like Eurostile. Especially if this font fits right in the thematic environment you are working on. If we stay with Eurostile, it could be a user interface for a super awesome space fighter or maybe a striking landing page for the next Star Wars movie.
But ‚Äî let‚Äôs get back to neutrality mentioned at the beginning and the connection to readability. A core part of proper typography is the correct use of symbols. You can either call it a glyph, character or simply mark, whatever you prefer. In this case, I‚Äôm talking about apostrophes and quotation marks. The right use of them will support an unaffected look of your overall written content.
Sure thing, most people would say, that this is some kind of nerdiness or a part of details you could easily neglect, and to be honest, this is not false at all. You can still read a text if someone is using wrong punctuation, but in essence, this is not only a matter of fondness, it is far more a matter of quality and readability.
So, if you want to improve your typographic quality, head over and have at look on the following.
The 19th century. A time without computers but imaginary genius. The first lightning bubbles were invented, electricity distributed broadly and people started to use typewriters.
To minimize space on the keyboard, typewriters combined similar symbols in one key and simplified them. Two of the most prominent ones, that are now known as dumb quotes: "" and ‚Äò, for example. Through this essentially economical decision, both of them are still widely used in our daily communication. Unfortunately not every software replace them automatically with the correct typographic symbols, so you have to take action and revise them manually.
It‚Äôs not always easy to recognize apostrophes and quotation marks. They look in general a little bit curvy and sloped in classical serif fonts. In grotesk ones like Helvetica, Univers or Founders Grotesk, they often drafted of a square with a little hook on it. While most geometric ones using a more simplified form.
You see, every typeface has it own style for apostrophes but in general they are designed in a similar direction. If you need a mnemonic: Compare them to a 6, 9 or a comma. They are never just simply straight.
The apostrophe is by far one of the most abused punctuation in the English language. A glance at store marquees, street signs, posters, and advertisements will show that almost no one knows how to us it properly. In general it has three different uses.
Instead of the apostrophe, the only central use of quotations marks is, to incorporate the quoted content. Americans use double quotes for initial quotations, then single quotes to incorporate quotations within the initial quotation. Hard to understand? The Example will help you.
The British doing it straight reversed. They use single quotes for initial quotations, then double quotes for quotations within the initial quotation.
Things going a little bit different in France. The mentioned curly whirly quotes replaced by guillemets. If you are working in an international context you have to keep this in mind.
In Germany, it‚Äôs even a little bit more complex‚Äîlike the language itself. So I separated this part a little bit.
At first, they are using the mentioned curly quotes. But in a different way. The quotation opens with a double quote placed on the baseline and closes with a raised one. Even the direction is different, in Germany we help us calling this ‚Äú99 below, 66 above!‚Äù.
Another way to quote is to use guillemets, quite similar to the French. But in a reversed version and named chevrons.
Attention: Germans don‚Äôt put any space after the opening chevron and before the closing chevron.
At least it is also allowed, but just quite rare, to use guillemets. But also without the extra space. So feel free to use them, if they fit more your personal taste. But I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them.
If you want dumbledork looking content ‚Äî feel free. Nay, seriously. It‚Äôs no problem to use them in your daily communication, like in messengers or E-Mails. Keep in mind that most people write or chat on mobile phones and it‚Äôs quite a pain in the ass to find the right symbols in a short time.
Also if the written text should be later copied into command line editor‚Äîmaybe a code snippet‚Äîyou should use dumb quotes.
But If we are talking about proper content with a sense of quality you should try to pay attention to use correct quotation marks.
For now, hopefully I could give you a first impression about it. Even if those little symbols seem so unimportant to most people out there, they can make a huge difference how a user is reading your content and how he will notice it. Typography is all about details and a certain feel. Even if you don‚Äôt see it on first sight, you will definitely sense it.
In the end, I would like to share you a side to side comparison, to show you how much different it makes with just using the right symbols.
You will recognize, the version with the real quotes look at first time coherent and most important, it will guide you through the text. The opening and closing forms of the quotes will show you the start- and endpoint of quoted content. At least, this is what we want to archive: structure content and give the readers guidance.
Thanks for reading and may the force be with you.

Get real. I‚Äôve got enough bad UX to invent 1000 Juiceros. This week‚Äôs sampling includes some true innovation in the art of slop. Fraudulent designers are coming up with novel ways to suck. I couldn‚Äôt come up with this stuff if I were trying to parody the industry.
You‚Äôll see what I mean.
Remember when you had to actually click an icon first before you could select photos to post? Not anymore.
There‚Äôs something profoundly unsettling about Facebook pushing your photos on you when you just want to write a status. Even more unsettling is the camera mode.
People do not fully engage with their phones when they use apps like Facebook. They are usually doing something else. Walking, talking, eating, driving, screwing. It is far too easy to click the wrong thing either by a slip of the finger, or some bad muscle memory calling up the wrong routine. It is not unthinkable that, as a result of this new design, someone might accidentally publish a photo they didn‚Äôt mean to, or even create a photo they didn‚Äôt want to. Does that seem implausible? If people can butt-dial, they can butt-post.
This is a blatant move by Facebook to normalize impulse posting of photos and further decrease people‚Äôs sense of privacy. It is disturbing but, obviously, completely unsurprising.
If I am in the mood to play guessing games as to what a button does, I will play Myst. At least in that case, the end result will be more interesting. Otherwise, I want those buttons to be properly labeled, and take a form that I can guess what they do, even without labeling. This is how most people feel on the subject of mystery meat buttons. Moreover, it is certainly not a novel concept in software to put labels on buttons. Interfaces have been doing that since the 70s.
Alas...
There‚Äôs a rightward triangle button on the bottom right of the screen. The placement is similar to Google Inbox‚Äôs compose button and, in general, the bottom right is the place for ‚Äúdo something that submits everything above it‚Äù. The fact that a rightward triangle usually implies ‚Äúplay a video‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really make sense here given that there is no video to play, so the secondary meaning of ‚Äúexecute command‚Äù seems more relevant. Maybe it means publish the site.
Given that ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù is already at the top right, and is clearly signified with microcopy, this must be something else. And it is.
It‚Äôs a tutorials button. They could have just had it say ‚ÄúTutorials‚Äù or ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù, but no. They made it a play button even though there was nothing to play. And weirder still, the button to close this popup is a STOP icon.
With only the rarest exceptions, omitting microcopy from buttons makes them ‚Äúmystery meat buttons‚Äù. Usually mystery meat buttons come with an icon of ambiguous meaning making it even harder to figure out what it does. But this is a whole new level. It takes symbols whose meaning is well established in the user‚Äôs memory and repurposes them while neglecting to label them.
Well played, Wix. Well played.
That pun was still not as bad as your design.
This marks AirBnB‚Äôs first appearance in a Bad UX Roundup, but it will definitely not be the last. ABB‚Äôs crappy design actually drove me away from their platform and back to regular hotels in 2016 after a bad experience. That story will get its own article. Today, I‚Äôm going to focus on the disastrous login.
The first step is straightforward enough, but there‚Äôs a bit of incongruous microcopy. I clicked ‚ÄúLog In‚Äù in the top-right corner, and the modal told me ‚ÄúLog in to continue‚Äù as though I had tried to perform an account-dependent action.
Not having logged in for a while, I couldn‚Äôt even remember how my account was set up, so I clicked Google. This was the result:
Yes, I have an account already and its corresponding e-mail is the one I tried to log in with automatically via Google. That‚Äôs major problem #1. If my Gmail address is already tied to the account, why can‚Äôt I log in using Google, even if I hadn‚Äôt created an account this way?
Next, per the prompt I was given, I tried entering in a password. As you can see, that didn‚Äôt do much good either.
Rather than telling me why that didn‚Äôt log me in, it cryptically told me ‚ÄúUnable to perform action.‚Äù Even worse, it said ‚ÄúPlease try again later.‚Äù which is patent bullshit. I tested this out several times over two days. This is not a ‚Äúlater‚Äù bug. This is a forever bug. If I tried logging in with this screen over and over, Michael Bay would win an Oscar before I got into my account.
So, I closed the modal by clicking on the surrounding space and noticed that there was no ‚ÄúLog In‚Äù option in the top-right any more. There was an empty avatar as though I were logged in, and it even said ‚ÄúLog Out‚Äù when I clicked on it, even though I was obviously not logged in.
After clicking on ‚ÄúLog Out‚Äù, I once again went to the login screen, only this time it had e-mail and password fields. It even entered my e-mail address for me automatically. Maybe I was getting somewhere.
And then, only when I tried and failed once more to log in, did I learn the truth. My account was set up via Facebook. If only I had known that from the start.
The questions I have for Airhead BnB are:
This is a seriously messed up login experience for a major tech brand. This is the kind of crap that companies are supposed to get sorted out in their first month of operation, not when they are on the verge of an IPO. Of course, this is a company that replaced a cheerful, immediately recognizable logo with a yonic monstrosity. Somebody is eating paint chips over there.
Let me start by making something very clear. Indicator lights are a half-assed solution. There is zip, zilch, zero excuse to design a computer or phone without the ability to physically disconnect the microphone and camera. Back in the good old days, you could easily disconnect both inputs, but now computers are being reduced to dumbed-down toys that give the user less and less control over their own property every year.
That said, an indicator light is better than nothing. It doesn‚Äôt stop me from taping over my camera, but it is better than nothing. Too bad that nothing is what you get for your microphone. Microphones cannot be taped over the way cameras can. Unlike light, vibrations travel through all sorts of materials, meaning you‚Äôd need some very obtrusive, distracting insulation to block the iMac‚Äôs microphone; good luck finding it anyway, as they aren‚Äôt interested in making it visually apparent. The very least these idiots could do is include a second light telling me that the microphone is active.
We live in perilous times. Computers are increasingly more inscrutable, with vulnerabilities and exploits lurking around every corner. The despicable infantilization of consumers has gone from merely depriving them of control over their privacy to actively treating them as spectacles in a zoo, as demonstrated by Facebook. I would not be surprised if the lack of fundamental and moronically easy privacy protections built into hardware is a willful attempt to normalize dehumanizing exhibitionism.
Anyone who knows me knows my aversion to anything resembling a government regulation, but this is the point at which I put my foot down. Computer and phone manufacturers should be required by law to include hardwired sensory input status lights that cannot be circumvented, as well as hard disconnects for every sensory input channel.
This never gets old. You might think I‚Äôd run out of new types of shit UX, if not new examples, but the stupidity and gall of the industry find a way as sure as dinosaurs with frog DNA.
Normally, online services let you unsubscribe via a link in their e-mails. Some sites make it harder than others with obtuse directions such as ‚Äúclick all the ones you wish to remain subscribed to‚Äù, but at least they let you do it.
This is not the case with Ancestry.com, who require that you call their phone number, no doubt waiting for an unspecified amount of time, to speak to a mumbling representative. I‚Äôm sure the waits can be long if there are people calling in also trying to unsubscribe.
I don‚Äôt know who came up with this policy, but they need to be slapped so hard, their grandchildren feel it. One day they‚Äôll look up their grandparent on Ancestry.com and find out what an assclown they were.
‚ÄúHey, didn‚Äôt you use to ask for 500 followers?‚Äù
Why yes. Yes I did. Then I hit 500. That‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm well over 500 now, which is awesome. But my goal for this year is actually 5-THOUSAND. That extra zero is a lot harder to get. If you hate bad design, and want to see the message of good design spread far and wide, then please follow me.
It‚Äôs not like this is the only thing I‚Äôve written. If you liked this, you‚Äôll love these:

When building a new product or defining which is the following step to take in an existing one we always come up with a lot of ideas, but it is important to discern which are really important to make sure our team uses all its efforts on the most valuable features at every moment of the process.
Trying to learn more about the prioritization process I got to read ‚ÄúIntercom on Product Management‚Äù book, which explains the main lessons they‚Äôve learned through their process of designing and managing new products.
So here i‚Äôll mention the main ideas I consider should be applied when working on a new project, or making decisions about your product:
If your product already exists and your team is planning the next step, you need to evaluate its features and decide what you should do with them by analyzing how many people actually use each feature and how often.
This is called a ‚ÄúFeature audit‚Äù, it will help you map all the features you want to develop or improve, and find the core value of your product and what it is actually being used for, helping you focus on the features that really matter.
A way of carrying it out is through analytics, there are several apps that can be used to it, but it can also be done manually considering user interviews or testings.
For those features with low adoption you have 4 options:
When the product doesn‚Äôt exist, I consider the feature audit can be used to evaluate the importance of a necessity or requirement according to the frequency of usage by the users.
Kaizen is a philosophy about making continuous improvements, without generating drastic changes. With this in mind you can improve existing features before consider adding new ones, and continuously improve your product.
So if you decided to gave a feature a second chance you have 3 options.
You can make Deliberate improvements when you know WHY the customers use certain features, you know that all customers use and like the feature, and you are looking to make it better for them by adding value to it. Since making these changes implies improving well-adopted features it generates a high risk, so it‚Äôs very important to get it right.
Frequency improvements are used when you want a feature to be used more often because you think it will be beneficial for users. A way of getting these ‚Äúendorsement‚Äù is through the hook pattern defined by Nir Eyal.
You may use Adoption improvements to ease the usage or resolve issues that keep customers from using certain features you consider important.
A good way of defining the reason behind the low adoption of a feature is to constantly ask ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù; ‚Äúwhy no one uses ‚Äòx‚Äô feature?, why no one sees the value?, why is the UI confusing? why are there so many bugs?‚Äù... and go on wondering why to every answer until you get to the root cause of the real problem.
I‚Äôve been talking about making a product better by improving its existing features, now I‚Äôll talk about what to keep in mind when introducing new features to a product.
You need to consider the benefits adding a new feature will bring to your product, prioritize the necessities, and give a thought on how to introduce them.
Where do we suck? Where does it matter? The focus should be on the disappointing but important features to customers, so you‚Äôll not end up working on features no one cares. A method proposed to determine what should be taken into consideration is to learn about where the opportunity lies?, by rating how important is a task and the current level of satisfaction.
One of the perks of using this formula is that features that you normally wouldn‚Äôt notice, stand out.
Here is a list of the main question I consider important to ask when building a new feature:
Some examples of ‚ÄúQuick wins‚Äù could be: - rewrite the app copy to make it more personal, funny, precise or useful. - add keyboard shortcuts to let power users be more productive on the main screen. - remember the last active project and bring the user back there when they next login. - provide extra information and links to actions in email notifications.
At Intercom, they add features following a series of steps using ‚ÄúFeature flags‚Äù, which is a technique that allows to progressively expose and validate new features and receive feedback, before making it public. Said method has 5 steps:
And you are looking for:
4. Full roll out: features are available to all users. Is important to show the users what they can do.
5. Message schedule for the feature: encourage people to use the feature. Focus on growing the usage of your product, instead of the growth of the product.
1. Make a strong first impressionMake the features discoverable, show your users how they work and motivate them to get started. A way of making this good impression could be by communicating with the users, letting them know how to get help, with tutorials, welcome messages
2. Gradually expose the depth of your product. Not all features are useful at first, and showing them from time to time by scheduling messages/notifications to show them when using the product is a good way of promoting.
3. Announce features and improvements in-app.Similar to previous, users are only interested on features when using the tool.
4. Show the users what they CAN DO, and not what you did, or what it does. The message impact and user interest in the features increases when you show them what they can do or achieve now.
As far i‚Äôve been talking about how to improve or add new features to our products, but what about those features that we shouldn‚Äôt consider or we need to get rid off?
The reasons for including a feature should be based on substantiated arguments, and not added just because if; data looks good, it takes little time, it could be optional, there is nothing else planned, 521,000 people want it or competition have it are some non-valid arguments used to ‚Äúsneak features‚Äù into a product, but are them enough? the answer is NO.
Remember this 6 things:
When you are defining a product roadmap, while prioritizing features and necessities, you should be comfortable saying NO to a feature you consider unnecessary. In this case you can make use of the ‚ÄúFeature audit‚Äù previously explained, to identify which features have been adopted, and which features are still struggling to be endorsed, and get rid of these.
Remember, when wondering which features keep and which don‚Äôt, ask: Who use them? Who don‚Äôt? and most important Why?
After all what is more important through this defining process is to always consider people needs and their problems; when you find their motivations to use a product, you know which features to develop and when. Always try to deliver the best solution to a problem, make it the simpler way possible and make it possible for more people, in more situations.

John Gorman|162K|4|https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-3-keys-to-becoming-irresistible-d2f689ea4bf1?source=---------1---------------------|The 3 Keys to Becoming Irresistible ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"There‚Äôs a routine question asked in job interviews, first dates, table games and so on: What is the most important thing you look for in other people?
There‚Äôs variations on this format (i.e. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the most attractive quality you look for in a potential partner?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your greatest strength?‚Äù And so on) but, in general, the answer remains the same: The character trait you hold above all. When pressed, I‚Äôve often stumbled and resorted to something trite and probably not true: honesty, humor, confidence, charisma, etc. Those are fine answers but they‚Äôre not in my estimation the correct ones.
And so one day I sat down on my pleather couch, brewed some holy basil tea, queued up some Anderson Paak on the Spotify and really, truly tried to whittle down the essence of what makes truly admirable, special people exactly that. I analyzed people I looked up to, people I was attracted to, and people I just couldn‚Äôt dream to be without. And I found that the answer could never be just one thing, and that many of the things I think I admire are manifestations of other, deeper things I admire more. Here are the three components that, when taken together, create a spellbinding supernova of a person ‚Äî one who can command a room and control their destiny, one who can be both altruistic and intelligent. And so I give them to you and make a case for each.
This trait is the root of all growth, learning and kindness. It‚Äôs the belief that you are not yet so great that your mind cannot be opened, and it‚Äôs the presence of mind to remember that we are all interconnected equals, and that injustice against one is an injustice against all. It is, flatly, an absence of entitlement. People who exhibit humility let their work speak for itself, they remain stoic in the face of their own suffering, and they remind themselves ‚Äî and others ‚Äî that life is fragile and therefore valuable. Humility quells ignorance and cultivates grace. I want this in the people I hold dear.
Without curiosity, you cannot be enthralling or even engaging, nor ‚Äî most rudimentary of all ‚Äî successful. It is frankly impossible. Curiosity drives an insatiable quest for knowledge, culture, novelty, experience, beauty, art and connection. It is the bedrock upon which you can build a life filled with stories, memories, accomplishments and relationships. People who exhibit curiosity can become masters, or polymaths, or auteurs ‚Äî but they must first always have an open mind. They first seek to listen, to absorb, to immerse, to traverse. The world is too large and their time on it too short to ever remain fully satisfied in their pursuit of whatever new ideas pass in front of them. I want people around me to remain curious, routinely examining the world through fresh eyes, and using their eyes to find fresh corners of the world.
This trait is the miracle drug of humanity (and elephants, and dolphins). It is the simplest, sweetest attribute one can possess, and the most worthwhile one worth cultivating for social success. Empathy brings people closer, and makes others feel understood and less alone inside. And if there is one thing we‚Äôre all looking to become a little less of, it‚Äôs alone. When I see truly empathetic people, I see people who genuinely care, but also people who remind us that sometimes it‚Äôs okay to be still with someone else and not invade their space or encroach their boundaries. This unique ability to understand the world through others‚Äô eyes and cut to the heart of what others are feeling and experiencing. Empathy breeds compassion, connection and love. It is an important precursor for honesty.
You may have noticed the three are closely related. This is no mere accident. In fact, when you stack humility, curiosity and empathy, you can easily see how they amplify each other.
Humility is the soul. Curiosity is the mind. Empathy is the heart.
Humility is how you value yourself. Curiosity is how you value your others. Empathy is how you value the bonds between yourself and others.
Humility is the soil of knowledge. Curiosity is the water that helps it grow. Empathy is the sunlight that shows us which way to bend.
And if you take any two without the third, you‚Äôre missing a crucial component: Humble, curious, apathetic people are slothful. Humble, disaffected, empathetic people are sensitive but not very interesting. Brash, curious, empathetic people are exhausting. But when you bring them all together, you create a benevolent triad.
These three traits are the key to becoming warm, smart and memorable. They‚Äôre irrepressible and irresistible. They‚Äôre my favorite qualities in others: the most attractive, the strongest, the most admirable. And whether I‚Äôm hiring them, dating them or learning from them, these are the qualities I look for above all others.

And we can‚Äôt protect our kids from it, no matter how hard we try
Editor‚Äôs Note: No Mercy/No Malice is a column from Professor Scott Galloway, where he shares various reflections on business, tech, and life each week.
Our national dialogue, if that‚Äôs what you can call it, has gone from coarse to vile. I appear on business television about once a week. Live TV is hard; the people are nice, and I‚Äôve convinced myself it‚Äôs a good regular challenge. CNBC, Bloomberg, and CNN feel very much at home for me, as we mostly engage in violent agreement ‚Äî my values mimic those of most media outlets, the conservative wing of the far left. I go on Fox regularly, as I want to get out of my bubble, and I like the people there. Stuart Varney is charming, and Neil Cavuto seems whip-smart. And it‚Äôs fun to be challenged (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a socialist, are you not?‚Äù). I even think the parties ‚Äî viewers, me, the host ‚Äî come away with more empathy for the other side. #dreamon
I went on Fox last week, and the conversation turned to Facebook executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. I made some strong (or weak, depending on your view) statements about how the duo would be remembered. Nothing I haven‚Äôt said before. The segment was posted to the Fox Business channel on YouTube. The comments were rattling. Many of those that got an upvote were misogynistic or anti-Semitic. What could explain this?
Most people cite as culprits the tone set by our leaders and the media‚Äôs adoption of rage as a business model. No doubt. But I believe the real fire starter is the tobacco of our generation, social media. It‚Äôs the algorithms that have determined that the path to more engagement, clicks, and Nissan ads is paved in rage. The algorithms sense if you lean left or right, then begin shoving you to the poles and serving you increasingly provocative and extreme content you can‚Äôt turn away from, to scratch a tribal itch.
Social platforms did not realize that ‚Äúconnecting the world‚Äù could lead to very bad places, and they‚Äôve been paid to ignore the problem. Some lowlights:
At what point does social media‚Äôs inability, or unwillingness, to stop fueling rage become a national security or health issue? I believe if YouTube were shut down for a week, due to public-safety risk, they would figure out a way (crisply) to dramatically reduce the problem. It would also, no doubt, dramatically reduce their profits.
NYU Stern colleague Jonathan Haidt has written a powerful book, The Coddling of the American Mind. He writes that in an attempt to sanitize our kids‚Äô lives, we‚Äôve used so many clean wipes that our children‚Äôs immune system is arrested. Our concierge parenting, clearing out all the obstacles, and protecting children from real-life experiences creates fragile adults who are then more prone to depression.
The rise in both digital media and mental health problems is correlated. The chaser is the introduction of social media, which, more so in girls, has created massive amounts of FOBLO (fear of being left out), the more hurtful version of FOMO. It‚Äôs one thing to hear about a party you weren‚Äôt invited to, and another to see it unfold real-time on your Instagram feed, alone in your room.
Teenagers are more ‚Äúsafe‚Äù than previous decades ‚Äî they drink less, smoke less, are safer drivers, and wait longer to have sex. But other trends are less positive, even distressing: teenagers are less rebellious, less happy, unprepared for adulthood. The toxic cocktail: helicopter parenting plus the allure of screens. Teenagers are physically safer than ever, yet they are more mentally vulnerable than before the introduction of smartphones. In 2016 depression among teen girls shot up 20%, among boys 6%, and the suicide rate has doubled for girls in the last 10 years. Boys typically play out their aggression physically ‚Äî they might shove or taunt each other. Girls, on the other hand, play out their aggression relationally, taking their revenge online, which is why social media has been particularly harmful to girls. (We make many of the same points in the revised paperback edition of The Four; the research is compelling.)
Kids are not as ready for college as previous generations and now ask for more protection against ideas they might oppose. Students at my alma mater, UCLA, have decided they need protection from people and ideas and have disinvited billionaire real estate businessman Sam Zell to speak, as some of his words aren‚Äôt just dated, but traumatizing.
I coddle my boys, and I know it‚Äôs wrong. My eldest was performing poorly at school ‚Äî not studying, forgetting his homework. My wife lowered the boom: ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù (yelling). ‚ÄúDid you even read the questions? Do you want another D? How will that make you feel when you get another D? Should we cancel soccer?‚Äù And then, the big gun came out: ‚ÄúShould we not let you play Fortnite?‚Äù Later that night I suggested she was too hard on him, he‚Äôd had a long day, and we should take it easy on him the rest of the weekend.
No such luck. First thing in the morning, after breakfast, sitting at the table berating him for the shoddy workmanship, ‚ÄúWhat is this? What. Is. This?‚Äù Painful. But here‚Äôs the thing, the immune system kicked in. He‚Äôs doing much better, not just in school, but he is doing better. Before, he was coming into our room and sleeping with us ‚Äî he was probably stressed out knowing we would soon learn about a bad test result and needed reassuring. Since his grades have picked up, he‚Äôs sleeping like an 11-year-old should, in his own room, in his own bed. His mom is his motivation, and she is our family‚Äôs rock. Not afraid of the germs (yelling), knowing he needs the immunities.
I am too coarse professionally and coddle too much at home. So much personal growth needed, so little time.
Life is so rich,
Scott

Jennifer Lowe|7.6K|4|https://psiloveyou.xyz/do-not-fall-in-love-with-a-smart-introverted-man-8792ac8ca4cd?source=---------3---------------------|Do not fall in love with a smart, introverted man ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"You overlook him at first.
He flies under the radar compared to other men. You‚Äôre not that attracted ‚Äî he‚Äôs irritatingly intellectual, a total nerd, somewhat of a killjoy.
But you reconnect later. Maybe it‚Äôs days later, maybe it‚Äôs a year.
He reaches out because of something interesting you wrote. It‚Äôs your writing, it‚Äôs always your writing that draws them in.
He‚Äôs not your usual type, so you have no plans to fall in love.
You discover: he‚Äôs interesting, he‚Äôs fascinating, he might very well be a genius. When he talks about data sets, somehow it‚Äôs poetry to your ears. His hobbies are unexpected and wide-ranging: philosophy, fishing, tango.
He was a terrible student in high school, yet highly accomplished outside of it. Maybe he traveled across Europe for chess tournaments, or around the U.S. for tennis championships, or spent long hours sketching art in a black sketch book.
There was one teacher in particular that believed in him, and that made all the difference.
He‚Äôs extraordinarily successful, astonishingly well-connected. If he was bored in school, he‚Äôs been challenged like no other in his career. He has driven an original idea or ambition to completion, with a discipline and willpower you can only imagine, achieved what most humans could only dream of.
And yet the more successful and brilliant he is in a particular area, the more awkward and incompetent he is in the most basic of others: he forgets to eat, he can‚Äôt pick out his own clothes, he can‚Äôt boil an egg.
But you smile when you learn of these quirks. You find them endearing.
He finds himself talking to you a lot, telling you things he has never told anyone else. You both conclude this must mean your connection is special. He cares about his mom, and his brother or his sister, but he fought a lot with his dad. His dad was narcissistic and cruel, and it‚Äôs an emotional scar that still wounds him today.
He‚Äôs got a penchant for logic games, and he speaks multiple languages. French, German, Japanese ‚Äî you will be entranced the first time you hear him speak another language, amazed by the worlds he floats effortlessly into that you could never know.
He‚Äôs a mathematician, analytical, an engineer, a hacker ‚Äî but above all, he loves to solve problems. There‚Äôs no problem he can‚Äôt solve or won‚Äôt try. To hack his brain, simply suggest a hypothetical problem and watch his mind spin in search of a solution.
He admits that he works a lot, he doesn‚Äôt meet a lot of women, but he‚Äôs looking for the right woman: smart, driven, beautiful. Not one for online dating or apps, he hates dating, and he‚Äôs frustrated and clueless.
You‚Äôre puzzled as to why. There is an aura of mystique that surrounds him when you meet, a kind of power and presence in his energy that he isn‚Äôt even aware of, and that is exactly what makes him so intriguing.
He may unexpectedly sweep you off your feet with his depth, his intensity, his thoughtfulness. Watch him when he‚Äôs lost in thought, for that faraway yet intent look in his eyes.
Suddenly you will find yourself in love with this strange but brilliant man.
When it comes to smart, introverted men, you may very well be the only woman they have liked in awhile. Fatally shy, they may never ask you out.
But if they do, each and every one of them will be almost comically nervous around you. Their hearts will race like crazy the first time they hold your hand, walking along the city‚Äôs waterfront under a starlit night sky.
You will hear the same words over and over from them: You are amazing, you are beautiful, you are gorgeous. Your skin is so soft, you feel so good, we fit so well together.
They say that they love you and that they care a lot about you. Perhaps you decide, against your better judgment, yes, why not, you would like to go on a crazy journey together.
Congratulations: you will know a depth and intensity of a connection few would think possible.
Every time, it‚Äôs the little things that make you love him even more. He‚Äôs attentive to detail, gracefully anticipates your needs. Oddly neurotic in the strangest of ways: afraid of heights, of germs, sensitive to sounds. You‚Äôve never met someone with his sleep patterns: he sleepwalks, he needs very little sleep, he‚Äôs out like a light.
Mostly, he just wants to make you happy. He loves to be with you, just to hear you talk.
You will laugh together, play together, dream up inspiring futures together. In the span of a few minutes, you can shift easily from giggling like silly 4-year-olds to discussing the troubling impact of AI on our species.
You‚Äôll make love. You‚Äôll fuck. Relax blissfully into each other‚Äôs arms. Lulled into a sense of home.
You will know a oneness that transcends worlds, and words.
One day, he will decide to leave you. It will be sudden and swift with no warning.
Troubled at last by doubt, terrified that committing any further will hurt you, triggered by personal traumas, he will decide, quietly, independently ‚Äî because that is how he has solved every problem ‚Äî that it‚Äôs over.
He‚Äôll miss your insights. Your freewheeling conversations. But that‚Äôs it.
His willpower and discipline means you will never hear from him again. The linearity of his mind means he will conclude, like a logic game, you were not meant to be.
He will not look back, QED.
You will never really know why. You will be haunted for days, months, even years. Till the end of time.
When you meet such a man, do not fall in love. You will be demolished, devastated, systematically destroyed, yet again, by yet another smart, introverted man.
Every single time.

Jessica Wildfire|3.1K|5|https://medium.com/@JessicaLexicus/want-healthy-relationships-ditch-loyalty-f4661be8b9da?source=---------4---------------------|Want healthy relationships? Ditch Loyalty ‚Äì Jessica Wildfire ‚Äì Medium|"Love triangle didn‚Äôt quite cover it. We were more of a pentagram. My best friend had told my fiance a secret. One that he wouldn‚Äôt share with me. Until I threatened to dump him.
That‚Äôs when he told the truth. My best friend had slept with my second best friend‚Äôs fiance. Seven times.
So there I was, caught between the most important people in my life. They were all going to make me choose.
It‚Äôs the kind of thing that can make your head explode.
Or your heart. If you have one.
My fiance didn‚Äôt like the ultimatum. He said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre making me do this. She made me promise not to tell anyone.‚Äù
Long term, none of that mattered. My fiance and I split less than a year later. So did my second best friend and hers.
We‚Äôve all grown apart since then. Not just because of the betrayal and sabotage. People move away. Start families. New priorities rise up. Something else always comes along to claim your loyalty.
The concept means almost nothing. Other words do a way better job at describing our relationships. Responsibility. Duty. Trust. Respect. Mutual interest. Personally, that one‚Äôs my favorite. No bullshit there. People work together toward a common goal.
You know you can trust someone when you both stand to benefit. Nobody‚Äôs going to screw you if it means screwing themselves.
Sound jaded? Don‚Äôt worry, throwing away the idea of loyalty will make you happier. You don‚Äôt need it.
Loyalty carries a lot of baggage, along with words like obligation and sacrifice. I mean, come on. If you really want to spend your life with someone, then you‚Äôre not sacrificing anything.
You‚Äôre making a choice about what you want more.
In a perfect world, everyone who decides to become a spouse or parent would stick with it. In my worst moments, I‚Äôve never wanted to actually leave my family. And I can‚Äôt think of a situation where that would change.
Meanwhile, I‚Äôve known enough shitty husbands and dads. Wives and moms. People who ruin their families, or just walk away.
My advice: let them.
The last thing you want is someone hanging around only due to a false sense of loyalty, pride, or obligation. Screw that.
You deserve better.
Mutual interest does a lot more legwork than you think. It was the only thing that convinced my fiance to tell me the truth.
My friend had sought his loyalty. I, on the other hand, simply told him it was impossible to trust someone who kept secrets. Especially if they also told me they were doing it ‚Äî apparently to seek my sympathy.
That‚Äôs right. He wanted me to feel bad for him, for choosing to keep a secret from me, for my own best friend.
My fiance had to make a choice about what he valued more. His weird, misplaced loyalty to my friend. Or me.
He chose me, that time.
You know, I probably should‚Äôve just dumped him.
After that, I had to decide what to tell my second best friend. A lot of thought went into my options. Ultimately I told her nothing. Loyalty offered no guidance here. In the end, it just wasn‚Äôt my place to get involved. Staying silent felt disloyal. But it felt right.
Telling my friend would‚Äôve been self righteous. After all, who was I to decide what should happen?
Loyalty usually offers nothing but a couple of trinkets and a t-shirt. It takes everything, though. Blind trust. Allegiance. Sacrifice. Someone who wants your loyalty doesn‚Äôt give a shit about you. They want you to serve them. Or a higher purpose. Watch out for those, too.
Some people love to pledge their loyalty. The word conjures up lofty images and makes us feel important. But it really only applies to a small handful of situations. I‚Äôm thinking of a secret service agent who takes a bullet. Or a soldier who gives up their life to save their unit.
Yes, that‚Äôs loyalty.
Most of what we do in the civilian world never approaches that level of commitment. So let‚Äôs lay off. Stop abusing the word.
We over-apply loyalty to relationships. Say what you want about the institution of marriage, but people have broken their vows ever since it was invented. Infidelity doesn‚Äôt pose a mortal threat to anyone.
It just sucks.
People cheat on each other and abandon their families all the time. A single mom or dad struggles on.
Responsibility makes a lot more sense when it comes to every aspect of our lives, including family and marriage. For example, every couple shares responsibility for the basic stuff ‚Äî food, shelter, clothing. Transportation. Bills. If you think you‚Äôre loyal for contributing to your family, get over yourself. You‚Äôre really just meeting the bottom tier.
Congratulations, you‚Äôre not a shit bag.
You can take a small amount of pride in carrying your weight as a regular, decent human being.
We owe our spouses honesty. As in we‚Äôre not supposed to sleep with someone else, without telling them. And so on.
Beyond that, relationships aren‚Äôt that hard. You get what you put into them. Some of my friends of yore have wanted too much from me, and others didn‚Äôt give enough. We couldn‚Äôt meet in the middle.
So our friendships ended.
Same thing applies to life partners. Right now, I‚Äôm in a relationship where we give and take equally. We don‚Äôt feel compelled to tell each other absolutely everything. But we don‚Äôt hide, either.
I‚Äôm not sure loyalty is the right word to describe what we have. More like long term mutual interest with benefits. We like having sex with each other, and in addition to that we trust each other‚Äôs judgment.
That doesn‚Äôt sound very romantic. But it works really well. And it‚Äôs a lot harder to find that than you think.
Loyalty makes us do stupid things. It carries an unfair sense of expectations. You can‚Äôt show loyalty to everyone. So stop trying.
None of my advice means you should only act out of self interest. A mature adult realizes that there‚Äôs no such thing. Your values and goals always get tangled up with other people‚Äôs.
Strop trying to be loyal. Cultivate honesty and fairness. Nothing comes in the form of lifelong guarantees. Build your friendships on mutual interest and respect, and you can‚Äôt go wrong.

Salma Elbarmawi|10.8K|5|https://psiloveyou.xyz/this-is-how-you-know-when-you-should-walk-away-1e11272f9d89?source=---------5---------------------|This is How You Know When You Should Walk Away ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"Walking away is often as much a choice as it is an obligation.
It comes with sacrifice as much as joy. It comes with times of unbelievable laughter and that of exquisite loneliness. It comes with uncertainty coupled with hope, and new experiences hidden behind doors that feel like a magic you never believed in.
I had left love. My career. The future I thought I would‚Äôve settled for, and the people I knew always had my back. I had left everything I‚Äôd told myself I was certain of, and somehow I hadn‚Äôt walked out on any of it.
They don‚Äôt tell you how to recognize which moment means you‚Äôre almost there, and the sorts of moments that become evidence that it‚Äôs gone on too long. They don‚Äôt lead you to understand that you‚Äôre asking the wrong questions, rather than losing control.
Your experiences become tasks, and your giggles become sounds you don‚Äôt believe in. You start to question who you are, and suspect that this is all there is. You start to lose faith in the idea of purpose. And assume ‚Äúpassion‚Äù is a word for the privileged.
And you begin to thread together stories. Ones of how you‚Äôre not cut out for a different life, or how your current one isn‚Äôt so bad. You create excuses that sound like crashing trees in a burning forest. And you lose yourself, in the hope that everything will work out like it‚Äôs supposed to.
The betrayal between you and yourself. The betrayal of looking into the mirror and seeing someone you don‚Äôt recognize. The betrayal of wanting to love your life and not knowing how.
The advice will seem obvious. Leave the job you don‚Äôt love. Walk away from the man who hurts you. Become the woman of your dreams.
What they don‚Äôt tell you ‚Äî what they fail to mention, is that it doesn‚Äôt happen that way.
To the untrained eye, I left my stable job, consistent income and comfort of my home, in a day. To the outsider, I packed as much as I could into a suitcase and effortlessly purchased a one-way ticket. To those who didn‚Äôt know me, I was brave, and adventurous and didn‚Äôt care about my career.
But they‚Äôre all wrong.
I began by leaving my job every day. For months. Until parts of me were so far removed, they had become capable of doing the work without asking what it was I was doing. I started packing in my mind long before I moved each piece of clothing from my closet to my suitcase. I started saying goodbye well before anyone even knew I was leaving.
And it wasn‚Äôt courage that led me to that place. It was holding my breath. It was jumping in before I was ready, and continuing to swim after it was too late to turn back.
I think when it‚Äôs chalked up to bravery, it simplifies all the anguish. It casts a shadow over the uncertainty. It neglects the days and weeks and months of nothingness before I felt like my heart was beating again.
And I wasn‚Äôt brave, but I‚Äôm capable of bravery. I wasn‚Äôt sure. But I‚Äôm capable of surviving uncertainty. I wasn‚Äôt ready, but looking back, I‚Äôve never been.
The ‚Äòdoing‚Äô is rarely the outcome of deciding.
Because deciding comes after the instances you chose to ignore. It follows the circumstances you allowed to play out. It‚Äôs right behind the bargains you made with destiny, and the ‚Äúone more chance‚Äù after you said ‚Äúno more.‚Äù
Deciding buys you time on your journey to doing. Deciding gives you space to hash out every possible thing that could go wrong. Deciding is a remedy for sitting still, but it isn‚Äôt the guarantee of a better life.
I recognized it was time to go when I was standing in front of the mirror asking myself if the person I was becoming was the person I wanted to be, and the answer made me tremble. I recognized it was time to walk away when I realized the people I loved were not the ones receiving my love, and I had forgotten how to let them in. I made a choice between the fear of the unknown and the fear of what I knew would destroy me.
And I learned. I learned that I needed plenty of days to get it wrong and only one to get it right. I learned that only I could create the answer I was looking for, regardless of to whom I asked the question. And I learned that the things you were never meant to leave, will still be there if you come back. Because sometimes leaving is an obligation ‚Äî and that makes it a duty, not desertion.
If you enjoyed this post, I‚Äôd love if you hit that clap.. And if you have thoughts, stories or questions I‚Äôd love to hear them.

Because it‚Äôs mostly shit advice.
Here‚Äôs a small sampling:
This is infatuation.
If someone‚Äôs ‚Äúalways‚Äù on your mind, you‚Äôre not focused on other Really Important Things. And that‚Äôs a problem.
Real love fits into real life, rather than usurping it. It‚Äôs calm, not overwhelming.
See above.
Ditto.
Well, I mean, damn. You fantasize long and hard enough, you can see anything in your future ‚Äî like I could imagine moving to Switzerland to be a goat farmer. That doesn‚Äôt mean I should.
The problem is that we‚Äôve made ‚Äúlove‚Äù into a game of escapism, and measure potential partners by how they fit into that fantasy. That‚Äôs not love.
So, sure, see them in your future ‚Äî but not because they ‚Äúcomplete the picture.‚Äù
See above.
Ha. Hahaha. Clearly you have never been in a (healthy) long-term relationship.
You should usually want to see bae. But love isn‚Äôt always wanting to. Sometimes you need a minute. Sometimes you need to work or do other things. Or, damn, just be.
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs not love just because sometimes you want space.
Well. That‚Äôs scary.
Y u tryin so hard? Loving isn‚Äôt ‚Äúimpressing.‚Äù
Healthy love doesn‚Äôt involve fear of loss. That‚Äôs attachment.
It also doesn‚Äôt involve fear of ‚Äúnever being with another woman.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know what that is. Low self esteem? Lack of conviction?
This is attachment again, not mature love.
This is self-love, not love. (Also: you‚Äôre an idiot.)
Well. Glad you‚Äôre getting your emotional needs met.
But this just means that they are deserving of love. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you are loving them.
Well. Thanks for the most unhelpful advice ever.
To everyone who‚Äôs ever said this: y tho? pls stahp.
Don‚Äôt perpetuate nonsense and call it ‚Äúromance‚Äù just because you don‚Äôt have suitable answers.
The difference here is probably what the rest of your day looks like.
Good: If you‚Äôre happy with your life and your partner adds to it, then congrats. You win.
Bad: If you‚Äôre unhappy and using your partner as an oasis, then you need to get your shit together.
Good: you actually care about their wants and needs, and prioritize them in a way that doesn‚Äôt tear you down
Bad: you compromise your own wants and needs, or base your value on your ability to ‚Äúkeep them happy.‚Äù
Rad for them
Congrats, there may be hope for you yet.
Great. I want happiness for most people.
You found someone with whom you‚Äôre comfortable, and whose company you enjoy. Good on you.
Role models have that effect on us, too. That doesn‚Äôt mean we love them.
You don‚Äôt feel love. You DO it. It‚Äôs an act, not a feeling. It‚Äôs a moment by moment decision and re-commitment. You know because it‚Äôs deliberate and conscious.
You invest. You exert effort.
You don‚Äôt knowingly do harm. You aren‚Äôt vengeful, petty, manipulative, or jealous. Their needs never seem irritating. You aren‚Äôt grabby with them, their time, or their affection in return. You are secure without demanding constant reassurance.
You prioritize their viewpoints. You learn their love language. You think in terms of their interests, not yours, and their needs are your own. You support them. You back them. You care and take care. You accept, and you allow.
Because everyone thinks they‚Äôre in love when it‚Äôs clear skies and calm waters, but watch them when the storm hits.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre pissed. It‚Äôs love if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúfight;‚Äù you disagree.
You love if your objective is reaching an agreement, not picking a winner.
You love if you don‚Äôt get defensive, insecure, or manipulative. If you don‚Äôt keep score. If you don‚Äôt hold grudges. If you don‚Äôt ‚Äútake back your love‚Äù as punishment.
You love if you seek to understand before being understood; listen and honor what they share ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt double down with your own issues. If you act like you‚Äôre on the same team. You listen. You compromise. You apologize. You forgive.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre hurt. Especially honoring and respecting their wants and needs even when they include ‚Äúbreaking up.‚Äù
We like to differentiate between ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù and ‚Äúloving‚Äù someone. But ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù is infatuation, and infatuation means nothing in getting real love.
So if what you want is real love, then ‚Äúhow to‚Äù is all that matters.
You ‚Äúknow‚Äù because you decide. It‚Äôs love when you do it. All the time.

Jessica Rosales|3.6K|3|https://psiloveyou.xyz/how-do-we-know-when-to-give-up-on-a-relationship-ef25bb6333d5?source=---------7---------------------|How do we know when to give up on a relationship? ‚Äì P.S. I Love You|"‚ÄúWhy are you giving up on us so soon?‚Äù my boyfriend asked me.
I was taken aback.
The thought of breaking up entered my mind long before we had this conversation. I had so many doubts about him and our relationship. He was impatient, belligerent, and refused to back down from a fight, even if he was the one at fault. He had a terrible temper that flared up at the smallest of provocations. And no matter how gently (i.e. non-aggressively) I touched on a problem or issue, it was almost always met with hostility ‚Äî hostility that I didn‚Äôt deserve.
I responded to his aggression with patience, and I countered his hostility with reason.
It wasn‚Äôt easy; it takes a lot of energy to be patient with someone who has wronged you yet refuses to acknowledge their faults.
His aggression was slowly chipping away at me, but I remained hopeful he would change. And while I did see some improvements here and there, they were temporary and minor; they didn‚Äôt last and they never actually resolved the bigger issues. (Band-aids on bullet holes, if you will.)
I no longer had the mental and emotional capacity to indulge his aggression. I raised my voice. I got angry. I fought back. And he could not, for the life of him, return the patience and understanding I had shown him all those times. It was then that I realized I was fighting an uphill battle all on my own.
Despite this, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder: Could he still change? Could we still get this relationship to work? Maybe with a little more time and effort...
And then it hit me.
Time and time again, he pleaded for another chance ‚Äî he promised he would change his ways, make amends, and do right by me. But time and time again, he did not deliver on those promises. We were stuck in a never-ending cycle of ‚Äúsecond chances,‚Äù one that I perpetuated by granting him chances that he didn‚Äôt deserve. I felt like I was hanging onto the ledge of a building that was about to crumble down.
If he wanted the relationship to work out, things would have changed by then, but they didn‚Äôt.
Could he have still changed for the sake of the relationship? Up until the very last moments preceding the breakup, I honestly wasn‚Äôt sure. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to predict what someone is capable of doing when given a second chance ‚Äî I still believed he could have changed.
At my core, I knew that I had given it my all. And if that wasn‚Äôt enough, then at least I can move forward without any regrets.
Was I giving up too soon? In retrospect, I wonder why I hadn‚Äôt given up sooner.

Jessica Wildfire|4.98K|6|https://medium.com/@JessicaLexicus/not-my-problem-a-moral-philosophy-3adde0561cb1?source=---------8---------------------|Not My Problem: A Moral Philosophy ‚Äì Jessica Wildfire ‚Äì Medium|"Some of us put in overtime every week, just to fix other people‚Äôs screwups. Maybe we don‚Äôt even get paid for it. We just know that certain things have to get done. So the work falls on us.
Stop doing that so much.
You might also bail out your friends when they‚Äôre caught in a jam. Let them crash at your place for a few weeks. Or months.
You‚Äôll pay their room and board until they get ‚Äúback on their feet.‚Äù Sure, you‚Äôre such a noble person.
But at some point, we all make the huge mistake of letting other people‚Äôs problems become ours.
Does that sound insensitive, harsh, cruel?
Then you really need to keep reading. Taking on too many problems, at work or otherwise, can burn up your compassion. Drain your energy. And leave you jaded and apathetic.
At that point, you‚Äôre no good to anyone.
Recently, one of my coworkers did finally decide to quit. Burned out. She took on too many other people‚Äôs jobs. It ruined her.
I‚Äôve seen it happen a dozen times. I‚Äôm noticing a pattern. Someone does an inhuman amount of work. They sacrifice themselves. People praise them. They ask, ‚ÄúHow do you manage it all?‚Äù
The hero shrugs and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just dedicated.‚Äù
A year later, they drop dead. Or quit. Something snaps. They reach a point where the work becomes too much.
Not every workaholic is built the same. Some people never burn out, even though they work all the time. But they‚Äôre doing things they enjoy. Things they find rewarding.
Here‚Äôs what they‚Äôre not doing: fixing Karen‚Äôs spreadsheets, because she can‚Äôt do her job. They‚Äôre not doing that.
Don‚Äôt fix Karen‚Äôs spreadsheets.
Stop writing Tyler‚Äôs software documentation because he constantly screws up. Sure, he might cause a major disaster.
But that disaster isn‚Äôt your problem.
Just because you see something going wrong, that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to jump in and fix it. Constantly bailing out other people might help your boss, or your company. But it doesn‚Äôt help you.
Not at all.
In fact, it hurts you. More than you know.
Hello, I‚Äôm Jessica. And I‚Äôm a recovering do-gooder. Last year, I jumped in and bailed out lots of people. Served on committees I didn‚Äôt need to. Showed people how to do things all the time. Corrected major problems with scheduling. Basically, I took on the work of an entire extra person.
Because nobody else was doing it.
But then I realized something. I‚Äôd created a reputation for myself as the fixer. People thought highly of me.
Coworkers said they wished I was in charge of the department.
Emphasis on the word wish. You see, incompetence weighs a lot. It‚Äôs hard to move. The same people who wished I was in charge would exhale and say with their next breath, ‚ÄúBut our chair will never step down. And I don‚Äôt want to start a war.‚Äù
They were happy to let me keep solving all the problems. As long as I didn‚Äôt expect anything in return.
Sometimes, we do extra work for free for a good reason. We want to level up. Prove ourselves capable. Position ourselves for a promotion.
But when you do that time and again, simply to shore up weaknesses in your department, you‚Äôre simply screwing yourself.
I‚Äôve learned that the hard way.
Things have gone different this semester. I‚Äôm not living on campus anymore. After my primary job duties, I have better places to be. Better things to do. For example, my family. My actual research. My blog.
Someone came to me for help with a big project last week. We met about it for an hour. I gave him some advice. Then a quiet silence overtook us. Finally, he realized I was waiting for him to leave.
At which point he said, ‚ÄúSo could you help me with this?‚Äù
And I said, ‚ÄúUh....I can give you advice?‚Äù
To which he answered, ‚ÄúCould you help me work up a proposal?‚Äù
And I replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve kinda got a full plate right now.‚Äù
So he said, ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù
And I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah...‚Äù
You‚Äôll be faced with these moments, too. Stay strong. Other people‚Äôs projects shouldn‚Äôt become yours, just because you want to be helpful.
It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve had to pull back. People like us, we tend to overextend ourselves. That means we have to constantly reign ourselves in. Remind ourselves what matters. What we actually want.
You should never feel selfish for refocusing on the kind of work you want to do. Stop letting people shame you into giving up your time.
And trust me, they will.
Indirect shaming does the most damage. We know how to deal with direct requests. The ones where we can just say ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno.‚Äù The sinister coworkers are the ones who say, ‚ÄúOh, hey! I haven‚Äôt seen you in a while.‚Äù Implication: where the hell have you been?
Then they start talking about how much work they do. Finally, they slip in something like, ‚ÄúIt sure would be nice to get some help.‚Äù Or, even worse, they say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how you manage to hold it together.‚Äù
Well, the real answer is because you‚Äôre organized. You know what you‚Äôre doing. And you manage your time well.
But you feel guilty. You doubt yourself. So you volunteer to help Alexis or Paul or Anastasia with tasks that shouldn‚Äôt overwhelm them.
Next thing you know, Anastasia‚Äôs posting bar selfies while you‚Äôre at home making her a flowchart.
Last semester, the director of another program tried to unload all of her paperwork on me. She‚Äôd noticed that I knew how to make PDF forms and manage digital signatures. You know, basic office skills.
We were collaborating on a project. Or it started that way. After a few weeks, she started sending me to-do lists.
Some items on that list entailed circulating forms and gathering signatures. That‚Äôs when I pulled the plug.
Sure, she got offended.
But I remembered ‚Äî her paperwork wasn‚Äôt my problem. I‚Äôd volunteered to help her with a project. Not act as her secretary.
It sounds easy to remember. But people like us forget all the time. Some things simply aren‚Äôt your problem. Do the work you have to do. And the work you want to do. Never do someone else‚Äôs work. There‚Äôs rarely a good reason to simply save someone else‚Äôs ass.
That sounds harsh. Maybe even cruel. If you can‚Äôt jive with that, ask yourself. How many people would do the same for you?
If you find yourself constantly stepping in to save the day, stop. You might enjoy the praise. Or you‚Äôre really that selfless.
But you might be making the problem worse. You‚Äôre enabling incompetence. You‚Äôre also perpetuating workload problems. Instead, point out that responsibilities need to shift.
You can take on someone else‚Äôs responsibility, but only if they exchange it for one of your jobs.
Talk to your boss about reassigning duties.
Try to adjust work flows. If you can‚Äôt, then maybe you should consider finding another employer.
In the end, the big boss is supposed to be distributing work according to qualifications, ability, and performance.
If they can‚Äôt do that, you‚Äôre not going to help by sacrificing yourself. Remember. Not your problem. If you struggle with this idea, then make yourself a poster. Write a jingle. Sing it in the shower.

Damien Dsoul|121|8|https://myerotica.com/something-about-charlie-abcc431d64ad?source=---------5---------------------|Something about Charlie ‚Äì MyErotica.com|"We have a neighbour who lives next door to us named Charlie. He is in his forties, a former Marine turned software entrepreneur, athletic and a very affable type of guy. He has a Ferrari in his garage that he refers to as his pride and joy. He was once married, but that ended several years ago. Since then he has remained single, and according to him, isn‚Äôt thinking about getting hitched for the foreseeable future.
Charlie has his seductive peculiarities, and I suspect these are what attracted Amber, my wife, towards him.
Amber never failed to gush over him. It was all done innocent-like, but there were times when I couldn‚Äôt help speculating about the reason she never ceased talking about Charlie non-stop. If she even saw him in his yard washing his Ferrari, she‚Äôd be bound to give me an earful about that. It was irritating at times listening to her frequent yapping about Charlie like he did something magnificent. I couldn‚Äôt help feeling jealous sometimes. But I tried to ride the wave and not complain, until it eventually got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt think straight anymore.
‚ÄúAmber, for fuck‚Äôs sake, what is it with you about Charlie this and Charlie that every goddamn day?‚Äù I complained one evening while we were having dinner and she was narrating to me Charlie‚Äôs latest acquisition: a statuesque blonde he had begun dating.
Amber glared at me from across the table and for a moment I thought she was going to hurl her fork at me.
‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sorry my talk has put you in a foul mood, Jeff,‚Äù she said sulkily. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just continue with dinner then.‚Äù
I felt relieved that evening when she didn‚Äôt mention Charlie‚Äôs name anymore, nor the following day or the day after. It was like we were back to being ourselves before Charlie moved into our lives. Except now and then I‚Äôd run into Charlie and caught the way he smiled at me. It looked more like he was sneering and I began suspecting something odd was going on that I was unaware of.
Charlie was a womaniser. He had women flocking in and out of his house almost every day of the week. He had introduced Amber and I to several of them. Each one looked as beautiful as the next, from gorgeous blondes to sexy brunettes and redheads. Each time I‚Äôd speculate that this would be the one to ensnare him back into monogamy, and each time I was wrong.
One afternoon I returned home early from work. The house appeared quiet at first; Amber had left a note saying she had taken off to the gym. I went into the kitchen to see about getting something to eat but stopped when I heard a strange noise coming from upstairs. It sounded like something bumping against the wall. I forgot everything I had in mind and went up the stairs to investigate.
The noise was coming from our bedroom, the door of which was left ajar. I approached it and took a peek inside. My eyes widened with shock at what I was seeing: Amber was lying in bed naked and a man ‚Äî a black man who resembled Charlie ‚Äî was on top of her, fucking her. It took some seconds for me to ascertain for real that it was my esteemed neighbour. That took me off-guard and my feet remained rooted behind the bedroom door beholding what was going on in my bedroom, telling myself that in no way was this a dream. I even pinched myself just to make sure. No, this was real.
‚ÄúUhh . . . Uuhh . . . yes, yes, yes! Fuck me just like that! Ohh . . . Charlie, I fucking love your cock!‚Äù
I rested my back against the wall, feeling my spirit drain from my soul, telling myself I hadn‚Äôt just heard what she said. They went silent for a moment and I went back to peeping through the doorway and saw he had turned her over onto her elbows and knees and was fucking her doggy style. I heard his cock slam into her like thunderclaps. The way she groaned in response, the expletives that flew out of her mouth told me she was having the time of her life.
‚ÄúOh yeah . . . that‚Äôs it. babe! Fuck that pussy, babe! Aaawhhhh fuck that pussy!‚Äù
Then I heard Charlie say: ‚ÄúYou want me to fuck your pussy hard, don‚Äôt you, bitch?‚Äù
‚ÄúAaahhhh yes, babe! Fuck my pussy with that big black dick! Uuhhh . . . fuck me like those other whores you bring to your home.‚Äù
Charlie smacked her ass. Amber yelped aloud. I bit my finger to keep myself from making a sound. He went on fucking her harder.
‚ÄúYou want to be one of my whore-bitches, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh yes, babe!‚Äù Amber hissed. ‚ÄúI want to be your next door bitch. Please, make me your bitch.‚Äù
To think that I would hear my wife utter these words to another man ‚Äî a neighbour who at the moment was fucking her in our bedroom! ‚Äî was inconceivable to me. But I was there listening to it, hearing her plead for him to fuck her, make a whore-wife out of her . . . hell, I was fucking watching it! I even listened as he climaxed. That was when I returned down the stairs and left the house.
I got back in my car and went for a drive around the neighbourhood. When I returned an hour later the house was as I had left it in the morning. Amber was in the kitchen making supper; Charlie was nowhere to be found. Amber inquired where I‚Äôd been. I gave her a pathetic lie about getting lost in the city. She didn‚Äôt bother to question me further; like she really didn‚Äôt care.
The days went on. But now I wasn‚Äôt the dumb fool that I had been prior to what I‚Äôd discovered was going on between my wife and my neighbour. We went on like nothing was amiss. Amber didn‚Äôt often bring up the subject of Charlie when we were together, but I tried to take note of her irregularities. I did try to be home as early as I could make it.
Twice so far I‚Äôve caught Charlie fucking her in our bedroom.
One weekend she practically chased me out of the house with a list of edibles to buy at the deli. Charlie had waved at me as he was mowing his front lawn at the time. I hid in a clump of bushes across the street and watched as Amber came out through the back door and signalled him over. I watched Charlie switch off his lawnmower and go over to join her. I gave them five minutes before going across, ducking as I passed the living room windows where I thought I caught a glimpse of them together. I made it to the back door and let myself in as quietly as I could. They were in the living room making out. Amber sat astride him on my favourite couch. I tried not to breathe too much as I listened in on their kissing and moaning.
Charlie asked: ‚ÄúHow long do you think it‚Äôs gonna take cuck boy to get back home?‚Äù
‚ÄúMaybe an hour,‚Äù Amber answered. ‚ÄúBut let‚Äôs not bother about him. I saw your latest catch last night through my window.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh yeah. She‚Äôs a marketing executive from out of state.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care who the bitch is or where you hooked up with her. I would have preferred if you were fucking me instead.‚Äù
Charlie laughed. ‚ÄúYou jealous, babe?‚Äù
‚ÄúI am,‚Äù Amber cooed as she slid down on her knees to free his cock out of his shorts. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm jealous that some other bitch is enjoying this cock of yours when I should be having it instead.‚Äù
I sneaked back out of the house and went and bought the bread and it was like nothing happened at all. Just another typical weekend for us.
Halloween arrived and Charlie threw a party and invited us to come over. Amber dressed up as a Scarlet Witch; I went and bought myself a Freddy Krueger sweater and hat, but left out the face mask and the knife gloves. Other neighbours had been invited as well. It was past nine in the evening and through the bedroom window I could see other couples coming over, all of them dressed in their eerie outfits. Amber was applying some last minute make-up to her face.
‚ÄúHow do I look, honey?‚Äù She turned to me and struck a pose.
‚ÄúLooking great,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSo, how long have you and Charlie been fucking?‚Äù
I meant to surprise her with the question, but I was unprepared for how she responded, without a hitch or tense moment.
‚ÄúBeen going on about a month now,‚Äù she said as she applied more lipstick. ‚ÄúAbout the time you told me to quit talking about him. You remember that?‚Äù
‚ÄúI do. You don‚Äôt sound surprised that I know.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve known since that first time you caught us, darling,‚Äù she laughed. ‚ÄúSince that day you came home early and found us fucking. You thought you were slick, but you made more noise than a stampeding herd. Charlie and I figured already that soon you‚Äôd know. He wanted me to tell you. But I suggested instead that it‚Äôd be best you find out the hard way. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been bringing him over here to fuck.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou wanted me to find out the hard way?‚Äù I repeated her words, stunned by how unconcerned she was. ‚ÄúIs that all you have to say?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat else would you expect me to say, Jeff?‚Äù she snapped, to which I gave no response. She set down her lipstick then went about cleaning her vanity table.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve fucked plenty of times at his place, darling. He‚Äôs such a beast in bed. He‚Äôs everything I can ever possibly want from a real man; you‚Äôre too much of a sissy to understand that. The first time we fucked, I realised then why plenty of women love flocking to him. Come on, let‚Äôs get going. Maybe you can get a chance to iron things out with him. Maybe you‚Äôll learn a thing or two from him.‚Äù
She picked up her cell phone then switched off the light and walked out of the room with me following behind.

A former soldier explains the emotional vacancy of ‚Äúthe fatherless generation‚Äù

I don‚Äôt have the group picture from the day my dad visited my fraternity house at Oklahoma State University. It was awkward compared to the ‚ÄúMom‚Äôs Day‚Äù photo we would snap a few months later. Not that it‚Äôs awkward to take pictures with my dad ‚Äî we‚Äôre all smiles ‚Äî but the ‚ÄúDad‚Äôs Day‚Äù photo, which hung above my fraternity brother‚Äôs desk, along with a compilation of date party photos, looked anything but natural.
Each year, the university invites parents to spend a day with their kids. Most of us eat at one of the iconic Eskimo Joe‚Äôs restaurants, tailgate, and then head to a football game. Afterward, it‚Äôs off to the bars, or whatever late night event your parent can muster the energy for. Outside fraternity and sorority houses, you‚Äôll find co-eds posing for group photos with dear old mom or dad.
The photos with the moms always turn out great. There we are, hugging mom or kissing her face. Everyone‚Äôs laughing and appears to be having a great time. If your mom made it out to the bar for a drink, like mine did, you‚Äôd introduce her to the girl you were interested in while acting part of the perfect gentlemen. Then you‚Äôd meet the mother of said-girl and your moms would screech about what a cute couple the two of you would make.
Dads were different. Like Saturn versus Earth different.
The group photos always seemed cold. There were some hugs happening, but they were those weird side hugs that Christians seem so fond of giving one another ‚Äî the ‚Äúkeep some room for the Holy Spirit‚Äù variety. Everyone looks like a stoic philosopher; the smiles seem somewhat forced. When the dads came to the bar, they either became Frank the Tank or scanned the room like the Terminator. Most guys never introduced their dad to the girl they were interested in, either. Unlike my mom, my dad and I grabbed dinner and caught up before he had to leave. He had work the next day.
I‚Äôve long wondered why the two photos turned out so opposite. Why did we suddenly look like ‚Äúmama‚Äôs boys‚Äù when we so often tried to be ‚Äúthe man?‚Äù Why such a lack of intimacy with our fathers (and even our friends) when we seemed to be OK with it from our mothers?
The memory of the Dad‚Äôs Day picture has been nagging me, so I start questioning other men and my friends. At first my question was too complex: Who did you learn emotional intimacy from? Or do you feel you have any intimacy with male friends? Some guys laughed. Other stared and responded with something like, ‚ÄúWTF does that mean?‚Äù So I changed my question:
The responses I‚Äôve received range from learning how to change a tire or the oil in a car, or learning how to tie a tie. This made me think, if this is what qualifies as masculinity, we‚Äôre in deep shit. So I dug further.
‚ÄúDid your dad ever talk to you about the mistakes he made in life? Was he vulnerable? Did he teach you how to date or romance a woman? How to pick healthy friends? Did he talk about sex, porn, or masturbation?‚Äù
It‚Äôs fascinating that in Judeo-Christian literature there‚Äôs an entire book of the Bible dedicated to teaching a son about money, friends, sex, adultery, making wise decisions, marriage, and business ‚Äî the book of Proverbs, in case you‚Äôre wondering ‚Äî but in America, the resounding answer I heard from men was, ‚ÄúNo, my dad didn‚Äôt talk about those things.‚Äù If a father did talk about those issues, then it was usually one of those, ‚ÄúThis is how sex works... good talk,‚Äù moments. But because we live in what I call a fatherless generation, Dad wasn‚Äôt often in the picture to begin with.
So where did we learn to become men?
Most everyone who‚Äôs read Lord of the Flies remembers how a group of boys descend into barbarity, and can easily recall the moment where Piggy gets his brains smashed in. For most boys, growing up these days isn‚Äôt all that dissimilar. With no one teaching young men virtue, character, or responsibility, the alpha male emerges thinking he has some semblance of how the world works, and so the other boys follow his lead. Sometimes the alpha male lands that leadership position because he‚Äôs mimicking problematic behavior that‚Äôs been demonstrated by a shitty father figure at home, which his friends may consider cool, since they don‚Äôt have positive male representation around them. Dad shows him porn, so he shows it to his friends, who then learn early on to objectify women. Dad talks about sports all the time and can tell you where every player on the Patriots played junior varsity football, so his alpha son gets his friends into sports and berates them for not having an encyclopedic knowledge. Dad talks about women with misogynistic overtones, so he and his friends mimic him and begin to talk that way too. Dad reminds his son that real men don‚Äôt cry. Real men act tough all the time. Real men get angry when insulted. Real men don‚Äôt show their emotions.
It doesn‚Äôt all come down to just one alpha‚Äôs influence, though. Many of these behaviors and ideas permeate young boys‚Äô minds through things they‚Äôve seen or heard in the media and online. The wolves teach the wolf pups how to become wolves. But we don‚Äôt run in packs anymore. We prefer to lone wolf it. Or if we do run in a pack, we never display weakness for fear we‚Äôll be turned on and devoured.
It‚Äôs a lonely world when you don‚Äôt have friends you can have deep conversations with. It‚Äôs much more common to find yourself in male friendships where you can‚Äôt express your angst or pain without fear of being labeled a pussy. There‚Äôs no camaraderie. Aside from guys you grab drinks with after work or go to a sporting event with, the extent of your relationship is superficial. When you don‚Äôt know how to manage your emotions, you won‚Äôt know how to handle rejection, dating, fear, loneliness, or sadness ‚Äî let alone anything else. Virtues like character, loyalty, love, humility, courage, and vulnerability are replaced with vices like anger, jealousy, vanity, and pride.
While men desperately crave emotional intimacy with other men, some of us have built up callouses so tough that even the notion of deep connection is considered effeminate. Instead, men lash out with deadly violence and dive head first into asynchronistic digital intimacy as opposed to real relationships.
When the package bombings that rocked Austin, Texas, made the news this past March, friends called to check and see if I was anywhere near the explosions. Once they learned I was fine, they asked if the bombings carried the markings of someone with military expertise, due to my combat experience.
All around Austin, fear ran rampant as rumors were passed as fact. Neighbors informed me that our area of town should expect to be hit next. I laughed at their misinformed panic, fueled by the fact that we love to believe what we want to hear ‚Äî provided it lines up with what we already assume.
When I explained that the Austin bombings carried the mark of an amateur who probably learned from YouTube, the dark web, or a jihadi website, people then asked about motive. While everyone still seems to be searching for it ‚Äî since bomber Mark Anthony Conditt‚Äôs confession video didn‚Äôt offer any definitive explanation ‚Äî I think it‚Äôs right in front of our faces. The statement made about Conditt‚Äôs confession video by Austin police Chief ¬≠Brian Manley explained that this was ‚Äúthe outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point.‚Äù
People were caught up in semantics after Manley‚Äôs statement, wanting to know whether the bomber was a terrorist or whether his motive was racially-based, since two of the victims were prominent members of Austin‚Äôs black community. I think the more simple truth is ‚Äî like other men in our generation ‚Äî Conditt was lonely, isolated, and bought into the view that men express anger and hurt through violence. As I stated in another piece, we‚Äôre dealing with a generation that no longer has the skills necessary to cope with hardship and adversity. People are chronically lonely even though they‚Äôre more connected than ever. Notice there are zero media reports in which they interview Conditt‚Äôs friends or past girlfriends, even. The only people in the interviews are old acquaintances from school or church. And don‚Äôt hold up the penalty card as if his dad provided sufficient care because he was raised in a religious home. Many times, religious homes can be the most emotionally vacant place for a young man.
One thing I feel would confirm my suspicions about the Austin bomber is whether he regularly consumed porn. Hear me out: Since we have no reports on friends or past girlfriends, one thing most lonely men do is watch porn. Just get on 4Chan or a similar site and the chatter often revolves around porn while simultaneously making fun of themselves for living in their parents‚Äô basements. It‚Äôs an easy patch for the lack of emotional intimacy they crave with a real human.
Can‚Äôt get a date? There‚Äôs porn for that.Don‚Äôt know how to talk to a woman? There‚Äôs porn for that.Get rejected when you ask a girl out? There‚Äôs porn for that.
In my line of work, I counsel a lot of young men through porn addiction. They always come in thinking porn is the issue, but it‚Äôs always symptomatic of something much deeper. Out of each man I‚Äôve counseled, I‚Äôve discovered that they all lacked emotional intimacy with their dad growing up. While that may sound ludicrous, consider this excerpt from Dr. Joshua Straub‚Äôs book Safe House.
Late one evening I stumbled out of a dusty building like a drunk pirate not quite used to walking on land. My head was spinning from the news I had just received. I wanted to vomit and scream all at the same time. The Iraqi base I was stationed at in the middle of Ramadi remained still while the whirl of generators filled the night, my shuffling adding to the noise. Taking another step, I collapsed into the dirt and wept until my tears formed mud on my hands and face.
It would be my friend Greg who would find the shell of a man lying on the ground with a muddy, tear-streaked face.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs leaving. She‚Äôs leaving... god, she‚Äôs really leaving,‚Äù is all I managed to get out while sobs racked my body.
Thirty minutes ago I‚Äôd gotten the devastating news about the end of my relationship back home. Iraq was a hard enough place to deal with anyway, but now the person I loved most was gone. Greg leaned me against his barrel-shaped chest and hugged me while I cried. What he said that night made all the difference.
Many view the military as the epitome or last great bastion of masculinity. Even English writer Samuel Johnson once remarked, ‚ÄúEvery man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier, or not having been at sea.‚Äù Each time men learn I served in the military and in combat, I often hear similar sentiments. ‚ÄúI wanted to enlist, but have a medical condition/parents wanted me to go to college/[insert reason here].‚Äù While many men (but not all) see the military as a mark of masculinity, what they fail to recognize or acknowledge is the deep and emotional bonding that occurs amongst soldiers. Instead they paint us solely as warriors and never poets with deep feelings.
Of the men I served with I can tell you about their life stories, fears, victories, relationships, and struggles. We‚Äôve cried, hugged, laughed, and shared some of our deepest secrets with one another.
While post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) gets lobbed around like a grenade in a china store as an explanation for why soldiers are killing themselves at an endemic rate, I believe the answer is much simpler. We‚Äôre lonely and lack the emotional intimacy we once had with our brothers in arms.
Those who ascribe to the toxic view that men should stifle their emotions are likely unaware of a soldier‚Äôs capacity to feel deeply ‚Äî due in large part to the relationships we foster ‚Äî and their possession of a so-called ‚Äúeffeminate‚Äù side.
As a child, I jumped off houses trying to mimic Superman. I microwaved spiders in an attempt to transform into Spiderman. Every stick was a sword. Apples became grenades. Crackers were carefully bitten into the shape of guns as my brother and I carried out invisible cracker wars with our snacks.
But I also drew and loved art. I sang in a choir. I played with Barbies. I wrote poetry and stories.
There is currently a two pronged assault on young boys.
This leaves a lot of young men growing up confused. We don‚Äôt engage in the healthy types of play we need to bond, and we don‚Äôt get the emotional connection we need from fathers or other men. This leaves men apathetic and indifferent when they feel they can be neither, and thus we retreat into our digital worlds of lethargy.
Today, many good men sit on the sidelines while evil continues to infect the masculine soul like a cancer. We‚Äôre not teaching young men virtue or character, but vice. We‚Äôre telling them, tamp down your feelings, but also don‚Äôt be too masculine because that‚Äôs bad. The internal warrior gets crushed, and the poet is labeled a sissy.
I‚Äôm not sure what the answer is to all this, but I know it begins with strong male figures ‚Äúfathering‚Äù other men. It will take men of integrity who want to change our culture from within, not those who scream from their social media soapbox. Any change that happens will be built on the backs of one-on-one mentoring between men of character and their pupils lost and adrift in today‚Äôs culture.
It will take men of honor.
It will take courage in a world that promotes vice.
Only then can we create warrior poets.

Lola Phoenix|7.6K|28|https://medium.com/@thelolaphoenix/thirteen-things-i-wish-id-learned-before-choosing-non-monogamy-ce3533cbd525?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|Thirteen things I wish I‚Äôd learned before choosing non-monogamy|"When you first learn about polyamory or non-monogamy, what most people call ‚Äòopen relationships‚Äô, you‚Äôll likely be directed to several publications: The Ethical Slut, Opening Up, and the website More Than Two. And these were things I read when I started my journey into non-monogamy.
Quickly I found though that there were several lessons I had to learn the hard way that these sources either didn‚Äôt teach me clearly enough or actually got in my way of learning these lessons.
So here are the 13 things I wish I‚Äôd learnt earlier about non-monogamy:
When you first start reading about non-monogamy, the emphasis on the unhealthiness of jealousy is drilled into you to the point where, at least for me, not being one of those jealous people you hear about that implode their own relationships by trying to control their partners‚Äô every move becomes your personal mission.
Beginner reading on non-monogamy over-hypes jealousy to the point where people go into non-monogamy assuming any negative feeling they have about a person their partner is dating is inherently jealousy and any attempt to express that feeling is automatically controlling, abusive behaviour.
In my first non-monogamous ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô, I had spoken to this guy for a year (I lived in the US, he in the UK and I was moving to the UK within a few months) when he suddenly began dating a person he‚Äôd never mentioned before. This person seemed relatively cool and similar to me so I offered to friend them on Facebook to get to know them. The guy immediately banned me from speaking to them on the grounds that he felt more comfortable with us talking in person first.
Given I was about to be in the UK in 6 months and I didn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòcontrolling‚Äô, I obliged. He said he‚Äôd told this person about me, even that they wanted to have a threesome with all of us. But unsurprisingly, he hadn‚Äôt so much as breathed a word to this person about me.
In hindsight, I never would have agreed to not speak to his new partner. That would have been a red flag. But I was so anxious to be seen as ‚Äòjealous‚Äô, I ignored my own feelings assuming they were monogamous baggage.
But they weren‚Äôt. Negative feelings are sometimes a result of your needs not being met. If your partner refuses to take you to your favourite restaurant and then takes someone new out on a date to that same restaurant, any rational human being is going to feel not so happy about that. Negative feelings and yes, even the scary green eyed monster of jealousy, can be justified and understandable.
What beginner sources of non-monogamy fail to communicate is that it‚Äôs not so much jealousy or negative feelings that are the problem ‚Äî it‚Äôs what we do with them that can make things implode.
When I started out in polyamorous communities, I was immediately drawn to those ‚Äòexperienced‚Äô people who seemed confident in what they were doing. Those people were not only attractive to me but seemed like the best bet. Obviously confident people communicate clearly, right? Obviously when you‚Äôre just starting out in something, someone who has. had loads of relationships and many partners is a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô bet, right?
Wrong.
Unfortunately, I found that confident people made me feel like I was being heard and listened to but that was rarely actually the case. Confident people can make you feel special and looked after, but when it actually comes time to devote emotional energy and resources to you, these people, in my experience, are rarely up for the task. Their ability to make you feel special is part of that confidence, but it isn‚Äôt actual human compassion you‚Äôre seeing.
Not to mention, just because someone has had many relationships, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre better at them. Relationships aren‚Äôt a game where playing gives you more experience. It‚Äôs about an individual exchange and if they have always come up a little short handed, it might be what is showing.
Another thing that beginner non-monogamous sources fail to really discuss is the fact that non-monogamous setups where an individual doesn‚Äôt spend a long time with any one individual but sees them rarely can allow for people who would normally be toxic and difficult to be around to have plenty of ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô relationships. If you only see someone once every two weeks and your time with them is great, you don‚Äôt necessarily see or have to deal with some of the more dubious aspects of their personality.
So sometimes having more partners than you know what to do with isn‚Äôt inherently a sign that you‚Äôre amazing at non-monogamy and beginners shouldn‚Äôt assume so.
Most relationship advice for anyone regardless of relationship style often boils down to this: Talk to your partner.
Like most advice, it‚Äôs much easier to give than it is to follow. And what non-monogamous beginner resources fail to really take into account is that communication is actually really really hard, but not for the reasons they assume.
As an autistic person, recognising my own emotions and understanding them can be really difficult. As a person with an anxiety disorder, my immediate response to my own fear is to not take it seriously or examine it with a fine toothed comb. And when embarking on something that you‚Äôre completely new to, sometimes you don‚Äôt really know or understand what you need until you‚Äôre not getting it and it hurts.
Pain is the body‚Äôs way of telling us something is wrong. And sometimes you have to experience emotional pain before you really understand that you have a boundary or you have a need that isn‚Äôt being met.
But admitting to your partner that you have a need can be an extremely emotionally vulnerable place. Most beginner non-monogamous resources are written, usually, by white people who more likely than not come from a specific socio-economic background. It‚Äôs not to say that white middle class people never have any problems, but I usually find that if you‚Äôve been treated poorly systemically by society or have a history of being abused, it can be really difficult to feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable with anyone.
I found myself in my relationships trying to manipulate situations so that I got what I really wanted without having to ask for it because asking directly for something you need and being told by someone you care for greatly that they refuse to do it is absolutely gut-wrenchingly horrifying. And the greater my need for any one thing, the less likely I was to ask directly for it.
Imagine if you were heading to a funeral at the same time your partner wanted to go to an event that they were excited about. Imagine asking directly for your partner to be there for you at the funeral and having your partner either say no to you or seeing them huff at the idea of supporting you in a vulnerable place in your life. Even if it‚Äôs not directly a cause for breakup, having such an important need be either not met or complained about by your partner can damage the intimacy you feel with them. If you can‚Äôt be vulnerable and ask for help from them... then it begs the question of what your partnership is.
Talking to your partner is scary. Asking for something you need is scary. And especially because we live in a society that encourages us all to be independent beings that don‚Äôt need anybody, especially if you‚Äôve been encouraged by society to see yourself as ‚Äòclingy‚Äô or worry about being so, and especially because non-monogamous resources reinforce the idea that you shouldn‚Äôt need anyone too much, it can be that much harder to want anything from anybody.
I wrote about how a relationship is not a skill in great detail, but to summarise, I often believed, like many monogamous people even do, that breaking up or not having a good relationship was a bad reflection on myself.
The reason I said above that having loads of relationships isn‚Äôt inherently a sign of someone good at relationships is because likewise having a bunch of exes isn‚Äôt necessarily a sign of being ‚Äòbad‚Äô at relationships either. It feels like non-monogamous communities especially encourage the idea that un-amicable breakups and ‚Äòdrama‚Äô are a sign of people just being bad at relationships. And therefore some of the confident people I mention might have loads of relationships, but a lot of quiet exes.
The aforementioned guy who suddenly ended up dating someone new and forbade me to speak to them ended up being a jerk outside of this and when I confronted him on it, blocked me on all forms of social media. I was tempted after this to tell his other partner about him blocking me on everything when confronted because I had come out of my haze and also had the sneaking suspicion that they knew nothing about me ‚Äî but avoided doing so for fear of looking like the ‚Äòjealous and crazy ex‚Äô.
And I think many people who have poor experiences with people are so ashamed that their relationship has ‚Äòfailed‚Äô they think it‚Äôs due to their lack of skill, or they are worried it will appear so, that they keep mum even when they think the person they dated is particularly toxic or abusive. No one wants to start ‚Äòdrama‚Äô or be seen as ‚Äòbad at relationships‚Äô.
But relationships are not skills. They are partnerships and co-ops. And just like getting in a car accident doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre inherently a bad driver, ending a relationship or having to end it doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre bad at relationships. There are relationship skills you can certainly improve like communication and compassion.
You can be really good at knowing your own boundaries or not so good. But ultimately sometimes you can‚Äôt be good enough for two people and sometimes two people, as nice and as great at they are at communicating, just don‚Äôt fit that well together.
Maybe if people saw breaking up less as a sign that someone is ‚Äòbad‚Äô at something, people would be less worried about looking like a ‚Äòbad ex‚Äô.
I‚Äôd read so much information about non-monogamy before I started that I felt like I knew exactly how to handle things. And my first experience being negative, I approached things with a sense that I‚Äôd even learned well from that. One of the things I insisted on after my first experience was trying to be friends with my partner‚Äôs partners.
You will often hear ‚Äòthere is no one right way to do polyamory‚Äô as a beginner and yet you will hear about ‚Äòcompersion‚Äô, which is meant to be the opposite of jealousy, whereby you hear about your partner having a good date or a good time with someone and you‚Äôre filled with happiness and feel glad for them.
Although people say there is no one right way, an ideal is communicated through this and many attitudes. The ‚Äòbest‚Äô way to do non-monogamy is clearly one where you experience ‚Äòcompersion‚Äô, no jealousy, no negative emotions, and never have any problems.
And this level of happiness is not expected within monogamy. In fact, in monogamy an unhappy marriage is almost expected. Countless male identified comedians have made entire careers over the idea that marriage and sexual monogamy is the end of their ‚Äòfun‚Äô and although monogamy (read: heterosexual, white monogamy) is a standard encouraged by this society, the idea that it‚Äôs not a picnic and not always fun and happy is also something that‚Äôs widely accepted.
And yet, non-monogamous people, because people so often blame a failed open relationship on opening it up in the first place and assume that it fails because non-monogamous relationships don‚Äôt work, are often so encouraged to be good PR for the non-monogamy community that they are expected to attain a level of relationship happiness monogamous people never have to match up to.
And this is an expectation reinforced within communities without monogamous people present. I‚Äôve seen countless people in polyamorous communities feel so anxious by the idea that their forum is filled with people confused and asking for help that they post positive and happy stories to almost reassure the outside world. Monogamous people are allowed to be unhappy and that not reflect badly on monogamy necessarily, but non-monogamous people, not so.
This pressure on me to be happy with my partner‚Äôs other relationships and to be friends with metamours (the people your partner dates) made me anxious and unhappy. I forced myself to socially interact with people beyond my personal means.
I forced myself to be friends with people I had nothing in common with and it made me sarcastic towards them. Instead of just accepting that maybe I don‚Äôt really need to be friends with metamours, I forced myself into it which inevitably made the situation tense and difficult anyways.
Furthermore, I felt like my indifference to my partner‚Äôs romantic exploits made me heartless and even somehow ‚Äòjealous‚Äô. And in fact, listening to details of my partner‚Äôs exploits stood my hair on end ‚Äî not because I was jealous or bothered ‚Äî but because the fear that I would become jealous was so intense it made me just as uncomfortable as jealousy would ‚Äî maybe even MORE uncomfortable. I would only realise later that my discomfort in being a voyeur had a lot to do with the sexual abuse I‚Äôd survived and nothing to do with feeling jealous at all.
I had to accept that compersion just might not be something I felt and hearing the details just made me anxious about being jealous ‚Äî and that was okay. I didn‚Äôt have to feel compersion to be happy for my partner on a wider scale. And I didn‚Äôt have to get along with or even like my metamours for things to be okay between any partner I had. Obviously, yeah, if we were to be friendly and when I am friendly with a metamor it is nice... but forcing myself to be friends with anyone in any situation is never comfortable and that‚Äôs just fine.
Compersion isn‚Äôt compulsory.
Non-monogamous beginners hear multiple times a day that ‚Äòlove is infinite‚Äô and it‚Äôs not necessarily wrong. While you may be able to love an infinite number of people, you only have so much energy in a day. As a person with a disability that affects my energy levels and social anxiety, I quickly realised that going out on a new date every night wasn‚Äôt something that I could physically do, and that‚Äôs okay.
I also found that a lot of people who espoused a ‚Äòlove is infinite‚Äô philosophy had many privileges they took for granted that I didn‚Äôt have. They had careers (or the ability to live fine without one) with flexible time options, the money to spend on activities, the mental and physical energy to socially interact with people without going to a breaking point.
One time I can recall, I went to an open relationships event in a new city and the conference involved a lot of intense interpersonal social interaction. After being invited to a party, I accepted, despite being exhausted. I ended up in a very loud, strange, unfamiliar house without any proper place to sit away from the huge crowds of people and became so sensory overloaded, I ended up crying. I felt ridiculous, un-fun, ashamed of my inability to go with the flow of everyone else until I eventually realised that my resourses just weren‚Äôt where others were.
You can love however many people you want, but there are only 24 hours in a day. Not all of us can afford to live within walking distance of all of our partners or afford a job that doesn‚Äôt run us ragged most of the week. It would be great if time and resources were as infinite as love, but they just aren‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs helpful to realise that.
As I mentioned before, there is an unhealthy expectation on non-monogamous people to be happy about everything going on within their relationships. You‚Äôre put under this expectation, especially due to some of the beginner material you read, to enjoy every aspect of non-monogamy, to be fine with all of the activities your partners have with others, and to be fine on your own.
But sometimes, you can be lonely ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay. Sometimes when my partner who lives with me is out visiting someone else I may in theory be very happy for them, but I am alone at present. And sure, I have found out the best way to resolve this issue is to try and make plans at the same time so I have company, but that‚Äôs not always possible.
Time isn‚Äôt infinite, as I said before, and ultimately agreeing to a non-monogamous relationship means agreeing to a relationship structure where any individual you partner with does not and cannot reasonably spend all of their time with you.
Monogamy also has this type of setup when one partner has a time consuming job like being a lawyer or doctor. But within non-monogamy it‚Äôs guarantee that part and parcel of what you‚Äôre agreeing to is for your partner to not devote all of their time and energies towards you.
And this can get lonely. Especially if you‚Äôre in the very likely scenario that one person has loads of dates and the other doesn‚Äôt. It can get sad. And I think we spend so much time trying to stay happy for our partner that we shove this loneliness down, don‚Äôt talk about it, and then it ends up blowing up in our faces. Especially given the polyamorous community crab bucket mentality of, ‚Äòoh no, there‚Äôs to many stories about people struggling with non-monogamy, let‚Äôs talk about how awesome it is‚Äô.
Statistically, the more relationships you have the more likely it is for you to encounter heartbreak. And although that is a hazard of the trade, it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to pretend like you‚Äôre not heartbroken if and when you are or that you‚Äôre not scared of it.
Sometimes it‚Äôs not awesome. Sometimes you‚Äôre lonely. The important thing to remember in this case is the benefits you ultimately get out of non-monogamy as a choice and to take steps to try and handle that loneliness. Steps that acknowledge and recognise your feelings rather than shoving a grin on your face and trying to feel okay with it all. Because eventually, if our partners aren‚Äôt spending enough time with us for us to be happy, we won‚Äôt actually be able to realise that if we‚Äôre trying our best to not be unhappy and lying to ourselves about it.
Monogamy, specifically heterosexual monogamy, is encouraged by the society we live in. And when you‚Äôre just starting out having open relationships, you can feel a bit isolated. You will have experiences where people will judge you for it (specifically if you‚Äôre read as female) and a lot of times people can feel this combination where they are shunned by society, admired by some while simultaneously feeling that what they are doing is ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô.
You get a lot of mixed messages as a beginner in non-monogamous communities: It‚Äôs more natural than monogamy and yet it‚Äôs scorned and hated and yet it‚Äôs seen as ‚Äòcool‚Äô and ‚Äòhip‚Äô. And that in turn can make things somewhat confusing, especially when the same sorts of conventions you see in monogamy seem to be still at play within non-monogamy.
For example, in a lot of non-monogamous settings I know, I see a lot of self-identified women in polyamorous families doing the majority of the child rearing or sharing child rearing between women partners while the men go out and do what they‚Äôd like. I see a lot of women stretching themselves providing emotional support for multiple people and getting nothing for themselves. I see a lot of situations where older men are using non-monogamy as an example of their ‚Äòfeminism‚Äô, dating multiple people who are much younger than they are and no one in their actual age bracket. You‚Äôll find a lot of convention within unconventionality.
Also, I find that people tend to have selective memories about history. Even within monogamous people, you have this concept that 50s era 2.5 kids with picket fences zeitgeist family is ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô and has been happening for years and years ‚Äî but this just isn‚Äôt true.
Romantic love and the idea that it‚Äôs not a sickness that needs to be cured is a relatively new idea in human history. Marriage being a symbol of love and not an exchange of property between families is a relatively new idea. Partnerships in life in decades past were not usually about love and sex, they were about wealth and power.
And in some cases even today people practice arranged marriage situations which aren‚Äôt necessarily problematic whereby a marriage is secured and a partnership forms out of a common need rather than what we would consider ‚Äòtypical‚Äô now of two individuals meeting and falling in love.
And ‚Äòaffairs‚Äô have not historically been a problem. Having multiple ‚Äòpartners‚Äô within socially sanctioned monogamy has been possible for wealthy men for hundreds of years. Maybe someone had a ‚Äòmarriage‚Äô, but that has never always meant sexual exclusivity. Or even if it has, that sexual exclusivity has purely been imposed on the person read as a woman within that exchange ‚Äî but very rarely for the men.
Not to mention, so many beginner non-monogmous guides are written from the perspective that the nuclear family was a reality for all of the individuals reading it while many poor and immigrant individuals may have never had that experience or expectation. Living jointly with family members, especially elders, is a common practice for a lot of people. So this idea that non-monogamy is defying all of the traditional conventions... well, it just isn‚Äôt.
Which is not to say feelings of loneliness aren‚Äôt valid or that there aren‚Äôt people who genuinely will dislike you for being non-monogamous. I will say though that ‚Äòopen relationships‚Äô aren‚Äôt necessarily completely unknown to mainstream culture and although there may be many misconceptions about them, there is yet to be a slur developed specifically for non-monogamous people.
And in my experience the vast majority of individuals who experience negative consequences for dating multiple people tend to be experiencing those consequences because they are read as women. People read as men can be judged by other men for ‚Äúallowing‚Äù their wives to sleep with other men, but this isn‚Äôt an anti-male consequence as the roots of this judgement stem from the idea that men need to be sexually dominant of the women they date and that women are subduing men by owning their own sexuality ‚Äî which is misogyny and ultimately about putting women back in their place, not about hating men or open relationships.
So the point of this is that, even while non-monogamy may be ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô, there are still plenty old conventional habits that pop up within it.
Eurocentric/white societies in general reinforce the idea of the individual as more important. We are encouraged in many ways to shine on our own, pull ourselves up by our ‚Äòbootstraps‚Äô, and not rely on others for help. Within non-monogamy, the reinforcement of the idea of being independent and allowing your partners to have independence means you often have this concept re-ingrained into you.
The advice so often given to beginners about jealousy is that they have to work it out themselves. In many cases, I find myself trying to handle everything on my own because I am worried about not only being a burden to my partners but also worried about making them feel I rely on them too much. I‚Äôve been encouraged to be self-sufficient to the point where asking for help becomes really difficult.
Sometimes it feels like it‚Äôs so not okay to have needs of your own, especially emotional ones, that it becomes another obstacle in asking for what you need. Because you don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòclingy‚Äô or be seen in a negative light within non-monogamy. Where monogamy is often characterised as unhealthy co-dependence, anything that seems to echo or reflect that can often be seen as just as negative. And when your relationships aren‚Äôt following an already culturally defined script of boundaries and what means what, you‚Äôre often left wondering who you can really ask for emotional support.
No one is actually an island though. We‚Äôre social creatures, even me who‚Äôs about as un-social as you can get. Sometimes we need help. And the people we feel comfortable enough to be romantic with are sometimes the people we feel safe asking for help from, moreso than others. And that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not clingy to have needs. And while your partners may not be your therapists and relying on any one individual for all of your emotional support may not be fair, ultimately you can‚Äôt help the things that you need. And pretending like you can take care of yourself all alone isn‚Äôt actually going to work.
When I first started out within non-monogamous communities, I was, like most people, nervous and hopeful I would make a good impression. I also had a bit of rose tinted glasses, hoping to be around people who understood me and the choices I wanted to make. I barely recognised until it was a little too late that the communities that I particularly entered were full of people who had completely different life experiences than me.
Some communities of non-monogamous people, and indeed many other communities you‚Äôll find, aren‚Äôt always the most diverse places and that can often leave you comparing yourself and your life to people who just don‚Äôt share the same experiences and understanding as you.
In my experience, feeling like I was the only non-binary person for example, was harsh. My feelings about being misgendered were often dismissed and glossed over. I‚Äôve heard within a meeting of non-monogamous people that polyamorous people just don‚Äôt have the time to concern themselves about transphobia and transmisogyny because they‚Äôre too busy with other things.
Diverse non-monogamous communities exist, but you have to sometimes go looking for them. If you find yourself feeling a bit isolated in yours, that may be for a reason. Take a look around and ask yourself if the only thing you really have in common is non-monogamy and if that‚Äôs actually going to hinder you instead of helping you.
If jealousy is the scarlet ‚ÄòJ‚Äô of non-monogamy, then insecurity is definitely its horrible cousin. People often will advise newcomers to work on their insecurities, to challenge them and to reassure themselves that they are worthy and worthwhile.
And this approach... might work. But what so many non-monogamy beginner guides leave out is the idea that being insecure can be a completely logical reaction to a given scenario and they very often assume insecurity is self-hate, when the two are not one in the same.
Insecurity is just that ‚Äî a lack of feeling secure. And when you‚Äôre starting a new relationship with someone, you may feel very insecure about the relationship and what you mean to each other. That makes a lot of sense. Feeling insecure in that situation doesn‚Äôt mean you assume that the person you‚Äôre starting the relationship with doesn‚Äôt like you, but that you‚Äôre not feeling secure about your relationship.
Likewise, I‚Äôve seen so many situations where people are kicking themselves for feeling insecure in a relationship (and ‚Äòjealous‚Äô) when it‚Äôs totally rational for them to feel insecure.
For example, say one partner has repeatedly broken promises to the other and then found a new hookup and the other partner is insecure about the new hookup. And the entire reason for that is because their relationship isn‚Äôt stable. If you have a partner who is not doing anything to make you feel valued and wanted or is in fact proving that you aren‚Äôt valued through action, you can tell yourself how awesome you are all you‚Äôd like ‚Äî it still won‚Äôt solve the actual problem or insecurity.
Insecurity isn‚Äôt something that happens always because you hate yourself or you think you‚Äôre unworthy. An Olympic athlete could feel insecure about their performance but still understand that their athletic performance is above average. Someone can have 50 Oscars for their acting work but still feel insecure when they go to an audition. We fear the unknown. We fear bad things happening. And that fear can cause insecurity. And we often mistake fear and insecurity for jealousy when it isn‚Äôt.
Self-hate is when you tell yourself that you‚Äôre not good enough, that your partners secretly hate you, and all of the other negative things that people sometimes experience. And the solution to this is to try and talk to yourself positively and stop attacking yourself. And self-hate can and does indeed cause you to feel insecure in a lot of things, relationships included. But not all insecurity is caused by self-hate.
It‚Äôs complicated because if your partner, for example, is neglecting you, you may hate yourself for feeling like you need more time with them. You may talk yourself down and say that you‚Äôre too clingy, too needy and that you need to pull yourself together. But maybe your partner isn‚Äôt actually spending as much time as you as an individual need from them. Maybe your partner missed an important birthday.
So you may feel temporarily better by trying to remind yourself of how much you are loved and how much you matter... but if your partner is neglecting you and not meeting the needs you have, you‚Äôre just going to be stuck in a cycle of just trying to stay afloat. Assuming your problems are all insecurity that needs to be dealt with by you reassuring yourself and not an inherent problem within the relationship of an unmet need or even neglect will just cause you to stay trapped in this cycle forever.
Don‚Äôt assume that your insecurity is always about self-hate. Sometimes it‚Äôs a sign that your needs aren‚Äôt being met. And even though not all people have the same needs and maybe you do in fact need more than others in some situations, if your relationships are going to work, your partners need to be willing to meet those needs if they can.
You may have to come to the conclusion that you‚Äôre not as compatible as you‚Äôd like to be, but it‚Äôs better to come to that conclusion than to perpetuate a relationship where you, at the end of the day, aren‚Äôt getting what you want and instead are just trying to pep talk your way through it.
‚ÄòI don‚Äôt need no stinkin‚Äô rules‚Äô, as you might have heard. Also hierarchies where you have a primary partner reflect non-monogamy and end up giving ‚Äòcouples privilege‚Äô to two people, hurting the secondary. All of this is bad, bad, bad, baaaaaad.
Except not.
It‚Äôs ironic how many people who say they don‚Äôt need rules expect their partners to practice safe sexual practices as a rule, but somehow don‚Äôt seem to see using barriers and getting tested as ‚Äòrule‚Äô, but instead ‚Äòcommon sense‚Äô. And yet an individual‚Äôs idea of what is ‚Äòrisky‚Äô sex can really vary wildly between people.
Especially given how so many people are just uninformed about sexual health risk that they are unaware that STI transmission is STILL possible, even using condoms. One of the reasons sex educators are saying ‚Äòsafer‚Äô sex instead of ‚Äòsafe‚Äô sex is precisely because of that misunderstanding.
I tend to take the Jack Sparrow approach to non-monogamy. The only rules that matter are these: What you can do and what you can‚Äôt do.
I can let my partners date whomever they like, but I can‚Äôt say that if they were to date someone who‚Äôs been abusive and nasty to me it wouldn‚Äôt affect my feelings towards them.
I can let my partners do whatever they‚Äôd like, but I can‚Äôt pretend like missing my birthday or something that‚Äôs important to me wouldn‚Äôt make me upset.
I can let my partners define their own boundaries, but I can‚Äôt, for example, see my partner abuse or hurt someone else and pretend like I‚Äôm fine with that.
Everyone has individual needs within their relationships, and that goes for all things. Any parent would tell you that each kid they have (or even teacher) is different, each individual needing different things. Sometimes you need different things from different people, but those needs become your boundaries and things that you want to deal with.
And part of the reason rules and hierarchies aren‚Äôt inherently bad is because they can help support those needs ‚Äî so long as you aren‚Äôt trying to control the uncontrollable.
So for example, I enjoy doing domestic things with partners. I prefer to have a partner who lives with me and where we establish a life together, maybe by getting a house together. The ideal type of non-monogamy that works for me is one where I have a ‚Äòprimary‚Äô partner I can trust to ask for emotional support and where I have other partners who are more casual and who would give the same amount of emotional support I would expect a friend to give me. This is what works for me and more or less is what works for my primary partner, which is why we have that type of relationship.
My partner does have more of a drive for casual relationships whereas I‚Äôm not as bothered if I don‚Äôt go out on a date for months. This is a situation that works for us both. And we communicate that to other people so we manage expectations. And in many cases, both in my experience as a primary partner and as a secondary who‚Äôs been discarded the moment I became inconvenient, having a clear understanding of expectations is what made things a lot better. Especially as an autistic person who needs clarity.
The problem with rules and hierarchies and why so much of the beginner non-monogamy advice will rail against them is because often people use rules and hierarchies to solve other problems that rules cannot solve.
You‚Äôll often find situations where one person has convinced their partner to do non-monogamy and they create a hierarchy and rules (e.g. you can‚Äôt sleep with someone until I say you can or we can‚Äôt have dates until both of us have one) to try and protect themselves against the fear of the unknown. And that‚Äôs understandable but the problem with rules is that the more you make, the more likely it will be that someone will forget and break one or that situations in life will create problems.
What beginner non-monogamy advice should do instead of unilaterally saying all rules and hierarchies are bad is instead expand on those rules which are likely to blow up in people‚Äôs faces.
For example, creating a rule that your partner has to check with you before sleeping with someone new is something I always advise against. Anything where one person gives ‚Äòpermission‚Äô creates a lot of pressure not only on the person giving permission to say yes to please their partner but also can create resentment if permission isn‚Äôt given.
And sometimes when casual situations arise, you may end up deciding to sleep with someone new at 1 AM in the morning, in which case telling your partner that you‚Äôre going to sleep with someone new could create more problems than it can solve, especially if your partner is having a rough day. Imagine missing your train, spilling your lunch, ruining an outfit, missing your partner, eating dinner alone and then being woken up at 1 AM by your partner calling to tell you they‚Äôre about sleep with someone else.
Yeah. Not so great.
The fear behind making this rule is an attempt to try and make sure that partners check in with each other to make sure they‚Äôre okay. And that doesn‚Äôt need to happen just before and can happen after. Instead of making a rule to enforce this kind of behaviour, what one should do is trying and create an atmosphere where your partner does check in with you, regardless of new partners or not, and makes sure your mental health is okay and where you feel comfortable telling your partner when it isn‚Äôt.
A rule enforced like this will not automatically create that type of atmosphere, so the rule isn‚Äôt going to help and may instead create more problems than it solves. I‚Äôd advise people to think about why they are making the rule and examine the reasoning behind it.
Last but not least, the advice so often not given to newbies is plainly: maybe non-monogamy just isn‚Äôt for you.
A lot of beginner non-monogamy writing is made with rose tinted eye implants, practically. Non-monogamy has a way of defying some of the things that are inherent but not exclusive to monogamy. Sometimes it can be freeing to feel like you can flirt without ‚Äòcheating‚Äô or do what you‚Äôd like. And that in turn makes people feel like non-monogamy is inherently better, inherently more egalitarian, inherently more socially progressive than monogamy.
And it can get to the point where non-monogamous people refer to monogamy derisively, almost blaming it instead of structures like misogyny and heterosexism for the way monogamy has kept them in a box.
That in turn can make people feel like the only egalitarian, ethical and socially progressive choice people can make IS non-monogamy. And like communism, non-monogamy can seem great on paper, but not work in practice for many people ‚Äî AND THAT IS OKAY.
As I said before, accepting non-monogamy means ultimately accepting that any one partner you have will not spend the entirety of their time and resources on you and visa versa. And maybe that‚Äôs not setup you want. Maybe that doesn‚Äôt work for you. Maybe having more people is just too complicated. Or maybe you‚Äôre just too damn tired to date more than one person.
All of this is okay. Choosing monogamy doesn‚Äôt mean you choose everything that society can tack on with it. Choosing monogamy doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll flip out if your partner notices someone else. It doesn‚Äôt mean you have a problem with your partner having sexual feelings or romantic feelings for someone else. Assuming that someone just being monogamous means they endorse society‚Äôs ideas about what monogamy should look like is a huge false equivalency.
That‚Äôs like me assuming as a non-binary person that any binary identified human being, trans or cis, automatically by identifying as a binary gender endorses everything that society tacks onto that gender ‚Äî and it‚Äôs just not true.
You may try non-monogamy and find it isn‚Äôt what you want, and that‚Äôs cool. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre backwards or want to live in the 50s. It may just mean it isn‚Äôt your cup of tea. And you‚Äôd think among ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô people, even that would be tolerated but sometimes it isn‚Äôt.
So that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm sure there will be more when I think about it some more, but for now, if I had known this before I started out, it would have saved me a lot of heartbreak and I‚Äôm hoping that for some beginners out there it helps them too.

Because it‚Äôs mostly shit advice.
Here‚Äôs a small sampling:
This is infatuation.
If someone‚Äôs ‚Äúalways‚Äù on your mind, you‚Äôre not focused on other Really Important Things. And that‚Äôs a problem.
Real love fits into real life, rather than usurping it. It‚Äôs calm, not overwhelming.
See above.
Ditto.
Well, I mean, damn. You fantasize long and hard enough, you can see anything in your future ‚Äî like I could imagine moving to Switzerland to be a goat farmer. That doesn‚Äôt mean I should.
The problem is that we‚Äôve made ‚Äúlove‚Äù into a game of escapism, and measure potential partners by how they fit into that fantasy. That‚Äôs not love.
So, sure, see them in your future ‚Äî but not because they ‚Äúcomplete the picture.‚Äù
See above.
Ha. Hahaha. Clearly you have never been in a (healthy) long-term relationship.
You should usually want to see bae. But love isn‚Äôt always wanting to. Sometimes you need a minute. Sometimes you need to work or do other things. Or, damn, just be.
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs not love just because sometimes you want space.
Well. That‚Äôs scary.
Y u tryin so hard? Loving isn‚Äôt ‚Äúimpressing.‚Äù
Healthy love doesn‚Äôt involve fear of loss. That‚Äôs attachment.
It also doesn‚Äôt involve fear of ‚Äúnever being with another woman.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know what that is. Low self esteem? Lack of conviction?
This is attachment again, not mature love.
This is self-love, not love. (Also: you‚Äôre an idiot.)
Well. Glad you‚Äôre getting your emotional needs met.
But this just means that they are deserving of love. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you are loving them.
Well. Thanks for the most unhelpful advice ever.
To everyone who‚Äôs ever said this: y tho? pls stahp.
Don‚Äôt perpetuate nonsense and call it ‚Äúromance‚Äù just because you don‚Äôt have suitable answers.
The difference here is probably what the rest of your day looks like.
Good: If you‚Äôre happy with your life and your partner adds to it, then congrats. You win.
Bad: If you‚Äôre unhappy and using your partner as an oasis, then you need to get your shit together.
Good: you actually care about their wants and needs, and prioritize them in a way that doesn‚Äôt tear you down
Bad: you compromise your own wants and needs, or base your value on your ability to ‚Äúkeep them happy.‚Äù
Rad for them
Congrats, there may be hope for you yet.
Great. I want happiness for most people.
You found someone with whom you‚Äôre comfortable, and whose company you enjoy. Good on you.
Role models have that effect on us, too. That doesn‚Äôt mean we love them.
You don‚Äôt feel love. You DO it. It‚Äôs an act, not a feeling. It‚Äôs a moment by moment decision and re-commitment. You know because it‚Äôs deliberate and conscious.
You invest. You exert effort.
You don‚Äôt knowingly do harm. You aren‚Äôt vengeful, petty, manipulative, or jealous. Their needs never seem irritating. You aren‚Äôt grabby with them, their time, or their affection in return. You are secure without demanding constant reassurance.
You prioritize their viewpoints. You learn their love language. You think in terms of their interests, not yours, and their needs are your own. You support them. You back them. You care and take care. You accept, and you allow.
Because everyone thinks they‚Äôre in love when it‚Äôs clear skies and calm waters, but watch them when the storm hits.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre pissed. It‚Äôs love if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúfight;‚Äù you disagree.
You love if your objective is reaching an agreement, not picking a winner.
You love if you don‚Äôt get defensive, insecure, or manipulative. If you don‚Äôt keep score. If you don‚Äôt hold grudges. If you don‚Äôt ‚Äútake back your love‚Äù as punishment.
You love if you seek to understand before being understood; listen and honor what they share ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt double down with your own issues. If you act like you‚Äôre on the same team. You listen. You compromise. You apologize. You forgive.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre hurt. Especially honoring and respecting their wants and needs even when they include ‚Äúbreaking up.‚Äù
We like to differentiate between ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù and ‚Äúloving‚Äù someone. But ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù is infatuation, and infatuation means nothing in getting real love.
So if what you want is real love, then ‚Äúhow to‚Äù is all that matters.
You ‚Äúknow‚Äù because you decide. It‚Äôs love when you do it. All the time.

John Gorman|162K|4|https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-3-keys-to-becoming-irresistible-d2f689ea4bf1?source=tag_archive---------3---------------------|The 3 Keys to Becoming Irresistible ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"There‚Äôs a routine question asked in job interviews, first dates, table games and so on: What is the most important thing you look for in other people?
There‚Äôs variations on this format (i.e. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the most attractive quality you look for in a potential partner?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your greatest strength?‚Äù And so on) but, in general, the answer remains the same: The character trait you hold above all. When pressed, I‚Äôve often stumbled and resorted to something trite and probably not true: honesty, humor, confidence, charisma, etc. Those are fine answers but they‚Äôre not in my estimation the correct ones.
And so one day I sat down on my pleather couch, brewed some holy basil tea, queued up some Anderson Paak on the Spotify and really, truly tried to whittle down the essence of what makes truly admirable, special people exactly that. I analyzed people I looked up to, people I was attracted to, and people I just couldn‚Äôt dream to be without. And I found that the answer could never be just one thing, and that many of the things I think I admire are manifestations of other, deeper things I admire more. Here are the three components that, when taken together, create a spellbinding supernova of a person ‚Äî one who can command a room and control their destiny, one who can be both altruistic and intelligent. And so I give them to you and make a case for each.
This trait is the root of all growth, learning and kindness. It‚Äôs the belief that you are not yet so great that your mind cannot be opened, and it‚Äôs the presence of mind to remember that we are all interconnected equals, and that injustice against one is an injustice against all. It is, flatly, an absence of entitlement. People who exhibit humility let their work speak for itself, they remain stoic in the face of their own suffering, and they remind themselves ‚Äî and others ‚Äî that life is fragile and therefore valuable. Humility quells ignorance and cultivates grace. I want this in the people I hold dear.
Without curiosity, you cannot be enthralling or even engaging, nor ‚Äî most rudimentary of all ‚Äî successful. It is frankly impossible. Curiosity drives an insatiable quest for knowledge, culture, novelty, experience, beauty, art and connection. It is the bedrock upon which you can build a life filled with stories, memories, accomplishments and relationships. People who exhibit curiosity can become masters, or polymaths, or auteurs ‚Äî but they must first always have an open mind. They first seek to listen, to absorb, to immerse, to traverse. The world is too large and their time on it too short to ever remain fully satisfied in their pursuit of whatever new ideas pass in front of them. I want people around me to remain curious, routinely examining the world through fresh eyes, and using their eyes to find fresh corners of the world.
This trait is the miracle drug of humanity (and elephants, and dolphins). It is the simplest, sweetest attribute one can possess, and the most worthwhile one worth cultivating for social success. Empathy brings people closer, and makes others feel understood and less alone inside. And if there is one thing we‚Äôre all looking to become a little less of, it‚Äôs alone. When I see truly empathetic people, I see people who genuinely care, but also people who remind us that sometimes it‚Äôs okay to be still with someone else and not invade their space or encroach their boundaries. This unique ability to understand the world through others‚Äô eyes and cut to the heart of what others are feeling and experiencing. Empathy breeds compassion, connection and love. It is an important precursor for honesty.
You may have noticed the three are closely related. This is no mere accident. In fact, when you stack humility, curiosity and empathy, you can easily see how they amplify each other.
Humility is the soul. Curiosity is the mind. Empathy is the heart.
Humility is how you value yourself. Curiosity is how you value your others. Empathy is how you value the bonds between yourself and others.
Humility is the soil of knowledge. Curiosity is the water that helps it grow. Empathy is the sunlight that shows us which way to bend.
And if you take any two without the third, you‚Äôre missing a crucial component: Humble, curious, apathetic people are slothful. Humble, disaffected, empathetic people are sensitive but not very interesting. Brash, curious, empathetic people are exhausting. But when you bring them all together, you create a benevolent triad.
These three traits are the key to becoming warm, smart and memorable. They‚Äôre irrepressible and irresistible. They‚Äôre my favorite qualities in others: the most attractive, the strongest, the most admirable. And whether I‚Äôm hiring them, dating them or learning from them, these are the qualities I look for above all others.

Anthony Moore|43K|8|https://medium.com/the-mission/why-most-people-will-never-have-great-relationships-bffc4152e978?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|Why Most People Will Never Have Great Relationships|"Relationships are perhaps the most important foundation for your life.
If you have great relationships, there‚Äôs virtually nothing that can defeat you, or even discourage you. As prolific author Frank Crane once wrote, having a close friend ‚Äúdoubles every joy and halves every defeat.‚Äù
But if most of your relationships are shallow and superficial, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have the most ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù life imaginable ‚Äî everything still rings hollow if there‚Äôs no one to celebrate with.
As part of a recent study, The National Science Foundation (NSF) asked 1,500 people how many friends they had that they could talk with about their personal troubles or triumphs.
1 in 4 said they had no one to talk with. That number doubled when they took out family members.
Two thirds of Americans say they‚Äôve lost more than 90% of the friends they had 10 years ago. Many Americans can only claim to have 2 close friends ‚Äî maybe less.
Why do most people have mediocre relationships ‚Äî or none at all?
Why are most people on track to never have great relationships?
Because they can‚Äôt be bothered to learn how.
When my wife Kimi and I were in premarital counseling, we read a book called The 5 Love Languages. That little book has made us 1000x closer to each other.
Maybe you‚Äôve read the book before. In a nutshell, the book says every person loves, and wants to be loved, in 5 ways (with 1 or 2 main preferences):
Everyone loves ‚Äî and wants to be loved ‚Äî in these 5 ways. But the reason most people continue to have mediocre relationships is because they just can‚Äôt be bothered to learn how the other person wants to be loved.
Not knowing how your loved ones want to be loved is extremely dangerous. This is where the deepest, most profound disconnects can happen, things like:
Most people can‚Äôt be bothered to learn how to communicate with and love their friends/partner the way they want.
As long as you never learn how you want to receive love ‚Äî and learn how those around you want to receive it ‚Äî you‚Äôll always have mediocre relationships.
Communication is hard. It takes empathy, focus, and conscious effort to give your friend the attention they need.
But isolation and loneliness are far harder.
The reason your relationships are mediocre is because you haven‚Äôt learned enough about communication.
(I wrote this section recently that ended up being highlighted by hundreds of people):
When my wife and I were in premarital counseling, our counselor gave us a piece of advice that would end up changing our lives:
Always make the first move.
The meaning is simple: if you can help the relationship, then do it. Don‚Äôt wait for the other person to act (even if you don‚Äôt want to).
Most people have strained and superficial relationships with family and even with friends. This is because most people always wait for the other person to ‚Äúmake the first move;‚Äù say hello, organize a hangout, or apologize.
This is a pride thing. It‚Äôs one of the main killers of marriages, friendships, and even families.
If you want to have deep, meaningful relationships with your friends, family, and even just the people in your day-to-day life, make the first move ‚Äî even if it should be them. Be the first to:
For a long time, I felt awkward and uncomfortable telling my brothers and sister ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù Three of the people whom I loved most in the entire world, and I couldn‚Äôt say it!
Now, I tell them I love them all the time. I say it over text, over casual phone calls, at crises, celebrations, and over the holidays. I tell my friends, too. Every single important person in my life ‚Äî mentors, family, friends, even coworkers, know how special they are to me.
It feels silly to be afraid to say this to a loved one. Yet, so many people can‚Äôt say a few simple words that would galvanize the entire relationship and deeply touch their soul.
Once you can do this, you can begin enjoying a gem most people never will: close, loving, life-giving relationships with many people.
In his book, No One Wants to Read Your Sh*t, New York Times Best-selling author Stephen Pressfield wrote:
In the same way artists and creatives can only connect with their audience through giving value, you can only truly connect with others when it stops being about you.
If you want deeply fulfilling relationships, you must give from yourself.
Give your time, attention, energy, love, and focus towards building and nurturing that relationship.
The individuals who do this are rare. But anyone who chooses to build their relationships like this are the ones who will have deep, meaningful relationships.
People with several deep, intimate relationships carry themselves differently. They treat their friends differently. They ask themselves specific questions that most people don‚Äôt even think of.
From a speech for alcoholics by marriage experts Dave and Polly P.:
Most people don‚Äôt ask themselves these hard questions. The truth is, if you have mediocre relationships, it‚Äôs likely because you‚Äôre being selfish, self-absorbed, or self-centered.
Can you say you‚Äôve been more selfless than selfish in the past few months?
Many people can‚Äôt.
The good news is, change is readily available.
All that is required is action.
Best-selling author Grant Cardone once wrote:
If you want to upgrade your relationships from mediocre to extraordinary, you must take actions you‚Äôve never taken before. Grant Cardone went on to write, ‚ÄúSuccess is just one of the byproducts of those who take the most action.‚Äù
Want incredible relationships, best friends, and an amazing partner?
Then take more action than you ever have before.
Most people carry severe baggage with them all day.
We‚Äôve all been hurt. We‚Äôve all been laughed at, excluded, beat up, put down, and forgotten.
A main difference between successful people and unsuccessful people is that successful people bring this garbage out in the open to heal it.
I could go on. I‚Äôm sure you could, too.
The reason people with successful, amazing relationships have them is because they‚Äôve chosen to address their own emotional garbage that prevents them from connecting.
If you want amazing relationships, you need to work on yourself first.
I saw my own life going down the toilet ‚Äî I was addicted to porn, had terrible unresolved family issues, and virtually nonexistent self-worth.
I made the choice to go to therapy, 12-step programs, and get all this crap out in the open.
It sucked. It required more of me than I‚Äôve ever had to give.
But my marriage with my wife is incomprehensibly amazing. I haven‚Äôt looked at porn in years. My wife teased me the other day that I have a million ‚Äúbro-mances.‚Äù She‚Äôs right ‚Äî I have a dozen guys that I know intimately, and they know me the same way.
If you want to upgrade your relationships from mediocre to extraordinary, then spend a lot of time, focus, and energy on making yourself better.
The amount of energy, focus, and care you put into making yourself better is proportionate to the level of relationships you‚Äôll have.
If you don‚Äôt invest in yourself...
If you don‚Äôt bother to learn how to communicate...
If you don‚Äôt care enough to learn how your loved ones want to be loved...
You‚Äôll always have mediocre relationships.
If you want amazing, high-quality relationships that will last for decades, you need to take action to learn how to do that. Take care of yourself, and heal what‚Äôs preventing you from connecting.

Kris Gage|24K|7|https://medium.com/@krisgage/signs-they-love-you-b13e65419e8c?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|Signs They Love You ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Most of the things that are listed in these sorts of articles are not love. They are attachment, or infatuation, or flirtation ‚Äî or something just being nice.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it looks across a series of emotions, lukewarm to love.
Here‚Äôs normal stuff that normal people do ‚Äî and should do ‚Äî even with strangers. It doesn‚Äôt even mean they necessarily like you as a person ‚Äî they might just be polite. Especially in the south.
None of these are signs of someone liking you. This is just normal human being stuff, guys.
Congrats, they socialize well and you probably do too.
Again, these aren‚Äôt love. Tiffany Sun just wrote a great post on this ‚Äî ‚Äúthings I wish guys didn‚Äôt take as a mixed signal.‚Äù
But don‚Äôt necessarily love you.
And not only not you, but often in a way that‚Äôs harmful to you, not genuine self-care.
i.e., things people do ‚Äúfor others‚Äù that are really for them.
i.e., a prerequisite to being able to love someone else.
Regardless of any of the above.
Way too many people worry about being ‚Äúfriend-zoned.‚Äù This is a misplaced concern. It‚Äôs a lot easier to transition a friendship into romance than to wring romantic feelings out of not even liking each other as people.
The bigger concern ‚Äî and what‚Äôs really happening for a lot of frustrated daters ‚Äî is that they barely even like you as a person.
They don‚Äôt care about your goals, your values, your fears, or your love language.
The big one is if they have a checklist of qualities they wanted in a partner and you happen to hit them. Or they have a list of stuff they‚Äôve always wanted to do with ‚Äúsomeone,‚Äù and now you‚Äôre working your way through it together. When asked what they like about you, they list different things than how you value yourself (especially if the first one is superficial, like looks.)
They adapted very little to ‚Äúaccommodate‚Äù you into their lives, and if you disappeared tomorrow, they‚Äôd just go on living exactly the same way they always have.
They make you laugh only because they get off on ‚Äúbeing funny.‚Äù They invite you on their trip because they just really want someone to travel with. They share books and music and film and restaurant suggestions because they just get off on sharing or being in the know ‚Äî or they need for you to like the same things ‚Äî not because they care about your opinion. Or they do nice gestures just because they have a deep need to feel ‚Äúappreciated‚Äù and influence over your happiness.
Somehow nothing is ever for them to own ‚Äî and they don‚Äôt want to. Their primary reaction is always to defend themselves, and they‚Äôre never to blame.
I don‚Äôt mean the occasional drifting. I mean a general, persistent feeling of ‚Äúawayness.‚Äù
One day they‚Äôre whispering sweet nothings in your ear, and then they go missing for two weeks.
Like ‚Äúbeautiful.‚Äù
They still make long-term plans without discussing it with you. They still propose weekend plans by saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs where I‚Äôll be if you wanna come.‚Äù
Their ask about your day in a way that‚Äôs half-hearted. They barely care about your struggles, and rarely share your celebrations.
They care about you and your wellbeing separate from themselves and their own.
Nobody can love without self-love. People without self-love will be seemingly ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù and ‚Äúself-less‚Äù but are actually using generosity to mask their deep-seated insecurity and need to build their self esteem around others emotional dependence on them.
They love you if they never check in on you loving them back. They love you if the energy is truly give, not give and ‚Äúnow-where‚Äôs-my-love-or-appreciation-back‚Äù take.
Without strings attached. When they‚Äôre invested in deeply understanding you. And they go out of their way to make you happy.
They rearrange their lives to fit you in.
People love themselves and their own lives, so if they start forgoing any of that to be with you, that‚Äôs a good sign.
It doesn‚Äôt have to be all their free time. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be every day. And it certainly doesn‚Äôt have to be as much as you want, if your idea of ‚Äúenough time‚Äù is higher than theirs. But they do prioritize you.
When you‚Äôre together, you‚Äôre together. They aren‚Äôt zoning out or interrupting while you‚Äôre talking, or eager for a distraction. Their mind is on the moment.
They use words. It may not be the three words you want most to hear, but there will be communication.
They‚Äôre supportive of whatever is most important to you.
Especially their future plans.
Your pain is their pain. Your happiness is their happiness. Your day is their day. Your aspirations are theirs, too.
Theirs as well as your own.

Kris Gage|18.1K|6|https://medium.com/@krisgage/oral-sex-doesnt-matter-c56c14a7afc3?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|Oral Sex Is Not The Measure Of A Partner ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Music artist DJ Khaled recently admitted in a radio interview that he doesn‚Äôt perform oral sex on his wife, and now for some reason The World feels personally victimized by DJ Khaled.
Responses include but are not limited to,
Like, for real, he could‚Äôve said that he likes to leave all the lights on, or can only orgasm while listening to Kenny G, or has a weird, uncontrollable compulsion to constantly go down on his wife, and none of this makes any difference whatsoever to us, as people who do not personally have sex with DJ Khaled.
The only person who needs to like DJ Khaled‚Äôs opinion is DJ Khaled‚Äôs partner.
Somewhere along the way, we seem to have all decided that performing oral was some holy barometer of ‚Äúbeing a worthy partner.‚Äù
User @grownmanishpod polled,
In response to these results, user @JessLuvsDonuts declared,
And in response to that, user @OsamuonameO asked a pretty obvious question:
And yeah, I side with that.
Writer Dalyce Lazaris offered a guide on ‚Äúwhat it actually means to be the ‚Äòchill girl,‚Äô‚Äù (because we‚Äôre all stressin over such a thing, apparently.) She asserts that ‚Äúchill‚Äù can include things like ‚Äúbeing flexible about which movie to watch together‚Äù (oh thank god; at least we‚Äôve got the important shit covered), but draws an ALL CAPS line in the sand on the matter of oral sex by asserting:
Say what now? Says who? You? On what basis?
What if you prefer plain ole P-in-V vanilla? THEN WHAT, DALYCE???
And ‚ÄúSteve, 25‚Äù generously offered up this simple rule of thumb on oral sex as an easy measure of the relationship:
And, wow. I mean, that‚Äôs pure poetry...
Like ‚Äúoh, fuck ‚Äî that stranger on the internet said a dude isn‚Äôt into me if he doesn‚Äôt go down, so now that‚Äôs Another Thing I Have To Have. I can‚Äôt sleep at night until I can rest assured he loves me, as measured by his willingness to perform specific sex acts.‚Äù
GUYS, COME ON.
Not only that, but we‚Äôve made ‚Äúperforms oral‚Äù a barometer of a dude‚Äôs character overall.
I think we all recall Lisbeth Salander assessment of Mikael Blomkvist in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo:
Well, who the hell asked your opinion on his sex life, Girl Who Is Not (Yet) His Sexual Partner?
I mean, she is being asked to share her thoughts on the dude in this scene, but this is the most important thing she needs to share? This is what‚Äôs offered as summary of his character?
Or person.
I‚Äôve dated great partners who perform oral.
I‚Äôve dated dudes who loved performing oral sex (some even more than I cared to receive it, which was fucking weird and, frankly, pretty off-putting) and were fucking terrible partners.
And I‚Äôve dated absolutely amazing human beings who, for whatever reason, just don‚Äôt like doing it. And that‚Äôs fine.
My currently partner doesn‚Äôt go down on me, and I literally do not care. To be fair, it was never my favorite thing to begin with. But that aside, he is the best partner I‚Äôve ever had, and my measurement of satisfaction ‚Äî in bed and in general ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt hinge on a single sexual act.
That, and I respect his boundaries as a human being.
Doing so is just cheap, disrespectful and brimming with insecurity.
Maybe he is sexist. Maybe he is selfish. Maybe he does find it gross.
But forcing him to do it when he doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äî for whatever reason ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt actually resolve the underlying issue. It only covers it up and creates weird, abstracted problems. If you think your partner is selfish or sexist, then address the mindset, not the motions.
You want equality and kindness between genders? Then respect other people‚Äôs boundaries!
Stop and consider the obvious question here:
First of all: wanting or enjoying oral sex is not the same as demanding it. I have never once been with a partner who literally demanded oral sex (or swore he could only orgasm from oral.)
If you ARE with a dude who DOES demand it, then: That‚Äôs a respect problem that should be resolved on its own, not ‚Äúbalanced out‚Äù by you demanding oral as well. (And if he can‚Äôt get over himself, then you should leave.)
Either that is a lie, or you are completely out of tune with your own body.
Because saying that you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt orgasm without oral‚Äù means that you can‚Äôt bring yourself to orgasm during masturbation. Is that true?
Like, every time you‚Äôre aroused you have to beg or plead or hope that some other living person goes down on you? Come on!
If that‚Äôs truly the case, get your shit together, sister, and figure out how to give yourself physical pleasure, damn. Not being able to cum without cunnilingus is literally the opposite of okay. You have to be able to pleasure yourself, not put the responsibility for your pleasure solely in other people‚Äôs hands (or mouths.)
See above. You are out of touch with your own body.
Yes, it‚Äôs true that many women can‚Äôt orgasm from vaginal penetration alone. But ‚ÄúP in V‚Äù and ‚Äúoral‚Äù are not the only two sex acts, and there are other options that don‚Äôt involve coercing our partners.
I‚Äôm not surprised. But that doesn‚Äôt make me wrong.
Girl, no.
People with solid self esteem don‚Äôt need to subjugate their partners or have their status reaffirmed through specific sex acts.
Only cheap, flimsy ‚Äúpower‚Äù comes from shit like this.
‚ÄúGood partner‚Äù is about bigger things.
The real offense that DJ Khaled made was when he got into super sexist jargon like it‚Äôs 1951. But again ‚Äî we are not in his relationship. So whatever.
You do you, boo boo. Stay in your lane, and watch your shit. And when it comes to monitoring for good partners, watch for the right things.
Good partners care about their partner‚Äôs sexual satisfaction, yes. That is true. But good partners also care about their partners enough to treat them with the basic consideration that they expect.

Kris Gage|17.6K|6|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-you-know-it-isnt-love-56939a087080?source=tag_archive---------7---------------------|How You Know It Isn‚Äôt Love ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Here are about a dozen ways to tell:
Don‚Äôt talk to me about peaks. Don‚Äôt talk to anybody about peaks ‚Äî not your partner, not your BFF, and especially not yourself.
Everyone experiences the elation of emotional peaks with their partners, and everybody wants to call these feelings ‚Äúlove,‚Äù especially early on. But these are fools gold, and even if you think ‚Äúthis one‚Äôs different, man,‚Äù I‚Äôll tell you again:love is never in the upside.
It‚Äôs in the valleys. And that‚Äôs where you know for sure.
What‚Äôs your gut reaction when things go south? What‚Äôs your lizard brain say when shit hits the fan? I‚Äôm not saying that you should listen to it ‚Äî lizard brains are notoriously stupid, and often need to be shushed and guided by more mature and developed thinking ‚Äî but I am saying you should notice.Because love is neither fight nor flight; love doubles-down, joins forces, makes it work. If your reaction is to throw punches or throw in the towel, it‚Äôs not love.
Look, just don‚Äôt talk about love in terms of feelings ‚Äî and this definitely includes ‚Äúinfatuation‚Äù or ‚Äúpreoccupation‚Äù or ‚Äúobsession‚Äù or ‚Äúcan‚Äôt live without‚Äù (see above.)
Talk about feelings all you want ‚Äî they are incredibly wonderful parts of the human experience ‚Äî and feel All Of The Feelings for your partner, because those are some of the juiciest. Just also understand that love is a choice, an active decision, and a series of investments and efforts and actions. Theproblem with defining love as ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù is twofold: 1.) it makes for immature relationships, and 2.) leaves us susceptible to one day ‚Äúnot feeling it‚Äù and folding.
Not just for a moment (because that happens to all of us) and also not as the result of depression (look into that to make sure), but rather a pervasivefeeling of not actually connecting.
This is different than feelings ‚Äúfading,‚Äù as mentioned above. You can still care deeply for someone but feel lonely every time you‚Äôre together. If you don‚Äôt actually connect, it will never be the making of a rich relationship.
I dated one dude for a while, when we were young and dumb and didn‚Äôt know what we didn‚Äôt know, and we thought this was well enough how love was supposed to look. But I can pinpoint the exact moment I realized we should break up. We were at the mall, killing time on another empty afternoon, not even walking around or actually shopping but just standing there, leaning on a railing and looking down at a lower level. And all of a sudden I was overcome with this immense loneliness ‚Äî not in the moment, but rather the sudden and undeniable realization that I was always lonely with him. We were never truly together; never really seeing each other eye to eye; instead just rushing around to distract ourselves from it. And once we stopped and stared at nothing long enough for me to see it, I couldn‚Äôt go back to unseeing.
Honestly, I either have no idea what ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù means or I just bundle it into other things (like ‚Äúintellectual companions,‚Äù and ‚Äúfriendship,‚Äù and ‚Äúconversation,‚Äù see below.)
But I guess it‚Äôs worth including because so many people do: if you continually come back to ‚Äúthe way your partner looks on paper‚Äù to defend the relationship to yourself, it‚Äôs probably going south.
This, as I said, is probably just my ‚Äúchemistry,‚Äù but either way it is, in my mind, a very important, stand-alone thing.
I dated a dude for five years who was plenty ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and successful in his own right, but he and I fundamentally operated in very different ways. I never felt as though I had an intellectual companion, and I spent years thinking, ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs fine ‚Äî we all make sacrifices in love. There is no perfect partner.‚Äù
But there‚Äôs a difference between rooting for different sports teams and being able to have the conversations you care most about. When I shared my most cherished thoughts or abstract questions ‚Äî like ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it interesting how people choose to build their lives?‚Äù ‚Äî looking to volley answers or even (dream big!) build a full-blown discussion, he would absentmindedly quell it with, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way things are ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt mean anything.‚Äù Full stop.
When it comes to a ‚Äúlife partner,‚Äù make sure they‚Äôre actually there for the ‚Äúlife stuff.‚Äù
Like if you share big news with your partner (you got promoted, won a deal, quit that job you hated, whatever) they shouldn‚Äôt sound as though you just said you grabbed milk on the way home.
Ditto for death.
They should hug you if you‚Äôre crying, offer to go to the services (and actually go, if you want them to and they can), and refrain from making jokes too soon or demanding brownie points if they order flowers. This is easy stuff, guys. Yet it‚Äôs amazing how many people eff this up.
After my brother died unexpectedly (and then a job offer fell through only after I‚Äôd quit my previous position), I came down with the worst cold (or flu) of my life ‚Äî the kind where your nose simply won‚Äôt stop running and you can‚Äôt manage basic functions and you‚Äôre so physically fatigued you can‚Äôt even go to the grocery to get drugs for it. My boyfriend and I lived together at the time, but he was so oblivious that after a day and a half I dragged myself, zombie-like, to the drug store two blocks away and bought my own meds, and was so exhausted by the time I got back that I crashed on the couch for hours afterwards.
For anybody who‚Äôs sitting there thinking, ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you just ask him?‚Äù Iseriously encourage you to reevaluate your standards of basic human decency and awareness. Normally ‚Äúasking‚Äù is correct. But damn, son.
With the biggest catalyst being ‚Äúmoving.‚Äù
When they move across the country (or the world) and you are in no way inclined to follow (except, perhaps, ‚Äúfor the adventure.‚Äù) Or, vice versa, when you feel compelled to move across the country but only half-care if they come.
If you think you love someone because they‚Äôre ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù or ‚Äúgiving‚Äù or ‚Äúmake you feel good‚Äù or some other self-serving pleasure, then you should realize: that‚Äôs not real love.
That‚Äôs not to say you don‚Äôt (or can‚Äôt) really love them, but ‚Äúthe pleasure they give you‚Äù (or, in codependent cases, the pleasure you give them) can never be the foundation.
Just go re-read the first section, honestly.
Mature love is based on healthy non-attachment
I don‚Äôt understand how anybody could ever think it‚Äôs ‚Äúromantic‚Äù for someone to declare, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to marry you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have kids with you‚Äù shortly after meeting them.
Gross. Get out of here with that grabby shit.
One dude I dated said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make you my wife‚Äù within a couple months of knowing me, and my knee jerk reaction was: ‚Äúwow ‚Äî does he not realize I have a say in this?‚Äù
The most interesting part was: I had come home from our first date feeling the same way. But the fact that he said it so matter of factly, without me ever verbally weighing in on the matter, turned me off so much it couldn‚Äôt be salvaged. It wasn‚Äôt cute and it wasn‚Äôt romantic ‚Äî even though our feelings had once aligned, because I realized that that fact didn‚Äôt actually matter to him.
It was presumptuous and off-putting and poor form. If you find this romantic, you really need to check your idea of personal agency and emotionalboundaries.
And that realization is, on the one hand, weird ‚Äî because I make decisions like this all the time with my partners (love is, after all, choice and commitment) so I‚Äôm not sure where the line is in whether ‚Äúdeciding‚Äù is love or ownership. Maybe it has to do with actually knowing the other person (as discerned by them, not you.) Either way, all I know is that when it aligns in the right way, it feels really good. And when it doesn‚Äôt, and they claim more of you than you offered or chose, it‚Äôs heart-wrenching. And it‚Äôs only worse if youdid choose or offer, only differently or less, because they don‚Äôt care and your left standing there with your heart in your hand.
Fear and love can‚Äôt coexist. If your primary anxiety around the idea of breaking up is ‚Äúfear of being alone,‚Äù it isn‚Äôt love.
Embracing each other as individual human beings with individual human being lives, who just happen to get along enough to bump down the road alongside one another.
Then, mutual investment and support in each other‚Äôs growth, especially when things get rough or scary. But always complementary, never to complete one another. And always with care and compassion.
Or clap or follow!

Tracy Moore|4.1K|6|https://medium.com/mel-magazine/men-get-sad-after-sex-now-we-have-a-concrete-answer-why-ae4fc490613b?source=tag_archive---------8---------------------|Men Get Sad After Sex. Now We Have a Concrete Answer Why|"The universe doesn‚Äôt always make sense. Good things don‚Äôt always feel great. Case in point: For some men, getting laid makes them really sad. But there‚Äôs good news, or at least a better understanding of what‚Äôs behind this phenomenon called postcoital dysphoria, or PCD. It‚Äôs proof that dudes are generally far more complicated that anyone gives them credit for.
It‚Äôs been a long time coming. Last year, we told you that psychology professor Robert Schweitzer of Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, was trying to find out why men get PCD, which he was aware of anecdotally but which hadn‚Äôt been properly investigated in men. Schweitzer had already researched and identified PCD in women, some 46 percent of whom say they‚Äôve experienced it in their lifetime. Their reasons vary but are related to anything from a history of sexual trauma to fear of abandonment to not getting off.
Ahead of Schweitzer‚Äôs call for answers last year, we asked men to tell us why they might get bummed out after sex. Their reasons:
There were other theories out there about why men might be inclined to get the post-sex blues. Largely, it was presumed that men, hardwired to fuck strong, must feel some essence of their maleness has been lost once they‚Äôre spent, and that this realization creates a natural sadness.
But Schweitzer‚Äôs research, which came out this week, is enlightening: Some 41 percent of men have experienced PCD in their lifetime, almost as many as women. And the reasons are typically one or more of the following: psychological distress, past sexual trauma or sexual dysfunction.
There‚Äôs no evolutionary-psychology bullshit here: Men who are stressed out, have been abused or have trouble getting it up can very well feel bummed out after fucking. That‚Äôs not shocking. But hey, we can never get enough reminders that men are human, too.
To conduct the research, Schweitzer ultimately surveyed about 1,200 dudes from 18 to 81 years of age from 78 different countries who said they were sexually active. The majority were not religious. Most had been in a relationship for at least a year, and considered themselves sexually satisfied with said relationship. They answered a 30-minute online survey of 14 questions about their sexual orientation, length of and satisfaction with their current relationship, and history of sexual dysfunction (including history of premature or delayed ejaculation, hypoactive sexual desire disorder and erectile dysfunction).
They also answered questions determining depression or anxiety levels, as well as history of sexual abuse or childhood trauma. Then they were asked whether they‚Äôd ever experienced ‚Äúinexplicable tearfulness, sadness or irritability following consensual sexual activity‚Äù either in the last four weeks, or ever.
The results: Some 41 percent of men had experienced PCD in their lifetime. About 20 percent had experienced it in the last four weeks. Around 4 percent said they experienced it ‚Äúmost or all of the time.‚Äù That‚Äôs interesting enough ‚Äî as noted before, around 46 percent of women have felt PCD, and around 4 percent also say they experience it all the time.
But the men who do so often had a history of sexual or emotional abuse in childhood, depression or anxiety, and more often, hypoactive sexual desire disorder ‚Äî or a general lack of sexual desire. (It used to be called ‚Äúbeing frigid,‚Äù and is mostly something you hear about related to women, who make up 33 percent of the reports of the disorder, compared with only 20 percent of men.) They were also more likely to experience premature or delayed ejaculation.
Participants described their own feelings in greater depth, and those who did wrote the following:
Schweitzer notes that the results show that the male experience in the resolution phase of sex are not always positive, and ‚Äúmay be far more varied, complex and nuanced than previously thought.‚Äù
He tells MEL that this sort of research is important, not just because it helps us understand that it can happen to men and women, but also because it helps undo the biases we have about how men relate to sex.
Even though the research doesn‚Äôt connect all the whats with the corresponding whys ‚Äî when asked why gay men were at a greater predisposition for PCD, he couldn‚Äôt answer that from the research itself ‚Äî it turns out that generally, this supports the notion that all men are not, in fact, prowling horn-dogs who will do anything to get laid and who put little other thought into the act than simply scoring another notch.
‚ÄúMen are not considered to be as interested in intimacy, are responsible for initiating, some would say, don‚Äôt discriminate, and are interested in ‚Äòconquest,‚Äô‚Äù Schweitzer writes. ‚ÄúNo doubt there are many other prejudices we have. There may well be support for some of these assumptions, but more importantly, we would argue, these are all generalizations, and in actual fact, the sexual experience for both women and for men is more varied than commonly acknowledged.‚Äù
While this research is only the beginning, Schweitzer says it‚Äôs a start to understanding what will help men have better sexual experiences, and how we might manage PCD when it comes up.
Schweitzer says at least one woman who experienced PCD benefited from psychotropics to manage the sadness. And awareness alone is always the first step on the path to normalizing any experience. But more than anything, it‚Äôs proof that in the end, talking about how we feel and our experiences is the first step toward solving them.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably most important to be able to have open discussions about experiences, free of embarrassment or shame,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúThe very act of open discussion around the experience may be helpful. This has been our experience in relation to feedback in response to PCD in females.‚Äù

John Gorman|20K|7|https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-art-of-intimacy-75bd969f6b4b?source=tag_archive---------9---------------------|The Art of Intimacy ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"Some time ago, I read ‚ÄúThe Opposite of Loneliness,‚Äù by Marina Keegan, a 22 year-old writing prodigy, killed in a car accident upon graduation from Yale University. She opened her award-winning essay, which spawned an extraordinary, posthumous bestselling book of the same name, with perhaps the most succinct distillation of human suffering ever articulated in print.
There are two profound tragedies of the human condition: Loneliness is one. Impermanence is the other. Loneliness is a tragedy of space. Impermanence is a tragedy of time. Humans are felled by their bodies ‚Äî prisons that confine us to only where and when we exist. Today, we‚Äôll focus exclusively on trying to subvert loneliness. We‚Äôll explore loneliness in an attempt to find its ‚Äúopposite.‚Äù
To find the word for the opposite of loneliness, we first need to define the word itself. Loneliness is commonly articulated as the sensational byproduct of being physically, mentally or emotionally alone. For example, if you had moved to a new city, or started a new job, and maybe the others would initially look at you like you‚Äôd grown a second head, as a curious interloper from another planet thrust into a foreign culture. That‚Äôs almost loneliness, but still not quite right. Real loneliness runs deeper than that. It‚Äôs feeling alone even when you aren‚Äôt actually alone.
Have you ever had the overwhelming sense of being alone, despite a venerable cornucopia of people you could call to knock back a cocktail or 12? Do you, perhaps, go out, and then stumble home at 3 a.m. and choke half to death on your own self-loathing? Each early morning ending exactly as the day began, no closer to those you‚Äôd gallivanted around with, and your cat silently judging you, while your friends text you and say ‚ÄúMan, that shit was epic?‚Äù Yet you still feel apart? Grand loneliness can arrive cloaked in a long con of community. Succinctly: Loneliness isn‚Äôt feeling like you don‚Äôt really know anybody. It‚Äôs feeling like nobody could ever really know you. How does this manifest itself?
When you‚Äôre with people, you speak and receive faint nods of approval, off-hand laughter, and pithy responses to zingers or outside-the-box thoughts. You might share a common ground, a common goal or a common interest. You disperse to bond another day. And yet you‚Äôre still left wondering why it isn‚Äôt clicking. You may describe your relationship with the world as a car in second gear, a fire-hose bulging and bursting from the inside-out, yet a mere mist when sprayed at its target. Loneliness is an unfulfilled desire for connection with others, a loathing and resignation that‚Äôs directed inward ... the electrical voltage that sparks connection reversed and turned upon itself, paralyzing you the way a Taser would. You‚Äôve watched your authentic self wall itself off from others; the communication with the outside world is tense and terse.
Guarded sharing is risk mitigation applied to social settings. It‚Äôs a series of quick-win verbal habits that are designed to be snackable content IRL. Everyone loves a biting wit, a compliment or good news. Bring enough of it to enough people and you‚Äôll make them feel warm and fuzzy all over. These are oral slap-singles, and they‚Äôre nearly a bulletproof way to be likable. Maybe you‚Äôve done this. I‚Äôve done this often. In fact ... it is my default setting. Make people smile and laugh and then vanish into the ether.
I don‚Äôt suppose I need to tell you this makes me a hit at parties, and also, surprisingly awkward. And here‚Äôs the stinging truth: A lot of likable people are completely lonely. Picture a homeless man who smiles, says ‚ÄúI love that shirt,‚Äù and wishes you ‚Äúa blessed day‚Äù before retreating to the solace of his overpass shelter. And you can also see examples of this scrolling through your your apps.
Let‚Äôs talk about social media for a minute. We craft these burgeoning social networks, and (supposedly) gleefully over-share in the hopes that somebody, anybody, will relate to us. Perhaps you‚Äôve widened your network to one, two, three thousand people that you consider friends, or sought out an avalanche of hearts and likes on a professionally candid photo, or a status that doubles as an epic depiction of your success, or a meme articulating distrust of the government. Perhaps you‚Äôve occasionally received that validation and it momentarily made you feel less lonely inside. Perhaps the words and pictures were so good and rang so true that they could not, nor shall not, be ignored.
But when all reaction is currency, and all reaction is cursory, self-loathing and self-doubt and the other two horsemen of the self-pocalypse ride into our virtual town. What your writing and posting and taste in YouTube videos say about you is, ultimately, that you‚Äôre worth listening to. I‚Äôve experienced this on Facebook, in response to cross-posting my many Medium pieces. But is that a precursor for becoming less lonely?
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so vulnerable,‚Äù my friends would tell me. ‚ÄúIt takes so much strength, courage and guts to bleed onto the keyboard for all to see.‚Äù
Ahhh ... but the masses have been duped. For what I share with anyone isn‚Äôt indicative of any sort of emotional vulnerability. I am broadcasting ‚Äî a far less personal or emotionally risky endeavor than conversation. Broadcasting things may make you someone worth listening to, but only conversation can confirm to people that you‚Äôre someone worth truly knowing. Those two ideas, and those two classes of people, are poles apart. Becoming someone worth knowing requires reciprocity and vulnerability. It requires actual investment of emotional capital into people you wish to know. And there‚Äôs only a fixed amount allotted for distribution, in a deeper way than taking 15 seconds to ‚Äúlike‚Äù and comment, anyway.
Keeping up an actual friendship requires resources. To be someone worth knowing requires real human interaction: conversing beyond quips and quick-hits, seeing and sharing activities beyond Buzzfeed links, expressing differences, changing minds, passionately defending the points that define our character, coming through when it matters, asking for (and offering) favors. This is what makes this life worth living. When we‚Äôre lonely, what we‚Äôre really craving is more connecting, not more connections. Stumbling home after 3 a.m. exhausting every truth we have in our arsenal, armor laid at the feet of our social sparring partners. And that leads us back to the opposite of loneliness.
The opposite of loneliness is intimacy ‚Äî the act of revealing your whole self to someone else and having them reciprocate. It is something you can only do one-on-one, face-to-face, soul-to-soul. When we stop taking hacks at softball pitches and start swinging for the fences, our acts and ideas first clear, then crumble, the walls we‚Äôve built to protect ourselves. Intimacy is an act of love, an act of self-love, and an act of defiance all in one. It‚Äôs gritty, emotional, raw, unfiltered, unabashed, unpretentious and unguarded. It‚Äôs more than talking about things together. It‚Äôs being and becoming about things together.
For what are we in this world if not connectable, interlocking parts? What is this joy, suffering, talent and wisdom, if not to be shared and imparted? How much has gone wasted or unremedied due to our inability for intimacy, our own tight-lipped, tightly-wound tendencies? A soul is not a silo, a mind is not a mine. We worship, learn, aid, sing, watch, call, visit, fuck, create, talk, love, try, read and write to bring ourselves closer. To make whole what we lack in the emptiness of loneliness. Each deeper connection creates deeper character, with more room to grow, more to lose and more to become. A heart unbroken is a life unwagered. A dream undashed is a life unlived. To play safe, to play solo, is to play a fool‚Äôs game ‚Äî we may find success in rising above the rest, but we may only win by lifting up others. This requires intimacy. There are no workarounds.
Indeed, we‚Äôre only unburdened when we let our heart hang out the window to dry ‚Äî when we let it be warmed, broken, run over by a semi, lifted, toyed with, and embraced. Intimacy requires the courage to make enemies as easily as we make friends, and watch the world dare to stand with us.
This is how we beat back the gray twilight of loneliness and find ourselves in the company of those we‚Äôve challenged to truly see and accept us for who we are. It‚Äôs that feeling of two (or more!) human vessels for unchecked, unabashed, unmitigated joy reciprocating that truth, love and splendor between each other, a game of emotional and intellectual catch where neither drops the ball. It is the transcendence of body as prison, and it is the momentary defeat of our uniquely human tragedy.
We don‚Äôt have a word for that feeling yet, but if we did, I could say that‚Äôs what I want in life.

Lola Phoenix|7.6K|28|https://medium.com/@thelolaphoenix/thirteen-things-i-wish-id-learned-before-choosing-non-monogamy-ce3533cbd525?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|Thirteen things I wish I‚Äôd learned before choosing non-monogamy|"When you first learn about polyamory or non-monogamy, what most people call ‚Äòopen relationships‚Äô, you‚Äôll likely be directed to several publications: The Ethical Slut, Opening Up, and the website More Than Two. And these were things I read when I started my journey into non-monogamy.
Quickly I found though that there were several lessons I had to learn the hard way that these sources either didn‚Äôt teach me clearly enough or actually got in my way of learning these lessons.
So here are the 13 things I wish I‚Äôd learnt earlier about non-monogamy:
When you first start reading about non-monogamy, the emphasis on the unhealthiness of jealousy is drilled into you to the point where, at least for me, not being one of those jealous people you hear about that implode their own relationships by trying to control their partners‚Äô every move becomes your personal mission.
Beginner reading on non-monogamy over-hypes jealousy to the point where people go into non-monogamy assuming any negative feeling they have about a person their partner is dating is inherently jealousy and any attempt to express that feeling is automatically controlling, abusive behaviour.
In my first non-monogamous ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô, I had spoken to this guy for a year (I lived in the US, he in the UK and I was moving to the UK within a few months) when he suddenly began dating a person he‚Äôd never mentioned before. This person seemed relatively cool and similar to me so I offered to friend them on Facebook to get to know them. The guy immediately banned me from speaking to them on the grounds that he felt more comfortable with us talking in person first.
Given I was about to be in the UK in 6 months and I didn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòcontrolling‚Äô, I obliged. He said he‚Äôd told this person about me, even that they wanted to have a threesome with all of us. But unsurprisingly, he hadn‚Äôt so much as breathed a word to this person about me.
In hindsight, I never would have agreed to not speak to his new partner. That would have been a red flag. But I was so anxious to be seen as ‚Äòjealous‚Äô, I ignored my own feelings assuming they were monogamous baggage.
But they weren‚Äôt. Negative feelings are sometimes a result of your needs not being met. If your partner refuses to take you to your favourite restaurant and then takes someone new out on a date to that same restaurant, any rational human being is going to feel not so happy about that. Negative feelings and yes, even the scary green eyed monster of jealousy, can be justified and understandable.
What beginner sources of non-monogamy fail to communicate is that it‚Äôs not so much jealousy or negative feelings that are the problem ‚Äî it‚Äôs what we do with them that can make things implode.
When I started out in polyamorous communities, I was immediately drawn to those ‚Äòexperienced‚Äô people who seemed confident in what they were doing. Those people were not only attractive to me but seemed like the best bet. Obviously confident people communicate clearly, right? Obviously when you‚Äôre just starting out in something, someone who has. had loads of relationships and many partners is a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô bet, right?
Wrong.
Unfortunately, I found that confident people made me feel like I was being heard and listened to but that was rarely actually the case. Confident people can make you feel special and looked after, but when it actually comes time to devote emotional energy and resources to you, these people, in my experience, are rarely up for the task. Their ability to make you feel special is part of that confidence, but it isn‚Äôt actual human compassion you‚Äôre seeing.
Not to mention, just because someone has had many relationships, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre better at them. Relationships aren‚Äôt a game where playing gives you more experience. It‚Äôs about an individual exchange and if they have always come up a little short handed, it might be what is showing.
Another thing that beginner non-monogamous sources fail to really discuss is the fact that non-monogamous setups where an individual doesn‚Äôt spend a long time with any one individual but sees them rarely can allow for people who would normally be toxic and difficult to be around to have plenty of ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô relationships. If you only see someone once every two weeks and your time with them is great, you don‚Äôt necessarily see or have to deal with some of the more dubious aspects of their personality.
So sometimes having more partners than you know what to do with isn‚Äôt inherently a sign that you‚Äôre amazing at non-monogamy and beginners shouldn‚Äôt assume so.
Most relationship advice for anyone regardless of relationship style often boils down to this: Talk to your partner.
Like most advice, it‚Äôs much easier to give than it is to follow. And what non-monogamous beginner resources fail to really take into account is that communication is actually really really hard, but not for the reasons they assume.
As an autistic person, recognising my own emotions and understanding them can be really difficult. As a person with an anxiety disorder, my immediate response to my own fear is to not take it seriously or examine it with a fine toothed comb. And when embarking on something that you‚Äôre completely new to, sometimes you don‚Äôt really know or understand what you need until you‚Äôre not getting it and it hurts.
Pain is the body‚Äôs way of telling us something is wrong. And sometimes you have to experience emotional pain before you really understand that you have a boundary or you have a need that isn‚Äôt being met.
But admitting to your partner that you have a need can be an extremely emotionally vulnerable place. Most beginner non-monogamous resources are written, usually, by white people who more likely than not come from a specific socio-economic background. It‚Äôs not to say that white middle class people never have any problems, but I usually find that if you‚Äôve been treated poorly systemically by society or have a history of being abused, it can be really difficult to feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable with anyone.
I found myself in my relationships trying to manipulate situations so that I got what I really wanted without having to ask for it because asking directly for something you need and being told by someone you care for greatly that they refuse to do it is absolutely gut-wrenchingly horrifying. And the greater my need for any one thing, the less likely I was to ask directly for it.
Imagine if you were heading to a funeral at the same time your partner wanted to go to an event that they were excited about. Imagine asking directly for your partner to be there for you at the funeral and having your partner either say no to you or seeing them huff at the idea of supporting you in a vulnerable place in your life. Even if it‚Äôs not directly a cause for breakup, having such an important need be either not met or complained about by your partner can damage the intimacy you feel with them. If you can‚Äôt be vulnerable and ask for help from them... then it begs the question of what your partnership is.
Talking to your partner is scary. Asking for something you need is scary. And especially because we live in a society that encourages us all to be independent beings that don‚Äôt need anybody, especially if you‚Äôve been encouraged by society to see yourself as ‚Äòclingy‚Äô or worry about being so, and especially because non-monogamous resources reinforce the idea that you shouldn‚Äôt need anyone too much, it can be that much harder to want anything from anybody.
I wrote about how a relationship is not a skill in great detail, but to summarise, I often believed, like many monogamous people even do, that breaking up or not having a good relationship was a bad reflection on myself.
The reason I said above that having loads of relationships isn‚Äôt inherently a sign of someone good at relationships is because likewise having a bunch of exes isn‚Äôt necessarily a sign of being ‚Äòbad‚Äô at relationships either. It feels like non-monogamous communities especially encourage the idea that un-amicable breakups and ‚Äòdrama‚Äô are a sign of people just being bad at relationships. And therefore some of the confident people I mention might have loads of relationships, but a lot of quiet exes.
The aforementioned guy who suddenly ended up dating someone new and forbade me to speak to them ended up being a jerk outside of this and when I confronted him on it, blocked me on all forms of social media. I was tempted after this to tell his other partner about him blocking me on everything when confronted because I had come out of my haze and also had the sneaking suspicion that they knew nothing about me ‚Äî but avoided doing so for fear of looking like the ‚Äòjealous and crazy ex‚Äô.
And I think many people who have poor experiences with people are so ashamed that their relationship has ‚Äòfailed‚Äô they think it‚Äôs due to their lack of skill, or they are worried it will appear so, that they keep mum even when they think the person they dated is particularly toxic or abusive. No one wants to start ‚Äòdrama‚Äô or be seen as ‚Äòbad at relationships‚Äô.
But relationships are not skills. They are partnerships and co-ops. And just like getting in a car accident doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre inherently a bad driver, ending a relationship or having to end it doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre bad at relationships. There are relationship skills you can certainly improve like communication and compassion.
You can be really good at knowing your own boundaries or not so good. But ultimately sometimes you can‚Äôt be good enough for two people and sometimes two people, as nice and as great at they are at communicating, just don‚Äôt fit that well together.
Maybe if people saw breaking up less as a sign that someone is ‚Äòbad‚Äô at something, people would be less worried about looking like a ‚Äòbad ex‚Äô.
I‚Äôd read so much information about non-monogamy before I started that I felt like I knew exactly how to handle things. And my first experience being negative, I approached things with a sense that I‚Äôd even learned well from that. One of the things I insisted on after my first experience was trying to be friends with my partner‚Äôs partners.
You will often hear ‚Äòthere is no one right way to do polyamory‚Äô as a beginner and yet you will hear about ‚Äòcompersion‚Äô, which is meant to be the opposite of jealousy, whereby you hear about your partner having a good date or a good time with someone and you‚Äôre filled with happiness and feel glad for them.
Although people say there is no one right way, an ideal is communicated through this and many attitudes. The ‚Äòbest‚Äô way to do non-monogamy is clearly one where you experience ‚Äòcompersion‚Äô, no jealousy, no negative emotions, and never have any problems.
And this level of happiness is not expected within monogamy. In fact, in monogamy an unhappy marriage is almost expected. Countless male identified comedians have made entire careers over the idea that marriage and sexual monogamy is the end of their ‚Äòfun‚Äô and although monogamy (read: heterosexual, white monogamy) is a standard encouraged by this society, the idea that it‚Äôs not a picnic and not always fun and happy is also something that‚Äôs widely accepted.
And yet, non-monogamous people, because people so often blame a failed open relationship on opening it up in the first place and assume that it fails because non-monogamous relationships don‚Äôt work, are often so encouraged to be good PR for the non-monogamy community that they are expected to attain a level of relationship happiness monogamous people never have to match up to.
And this is an expectation reinforced within communities without monogamous people present. I‚Äôve seen countless people in polyamorous communities feel so anxious by the idea that their forum is filled with people confused and asking for help that they post positive and happy stories to almost reassure the outside world. Monogamous people are allowed to be unhappy and that not reflect badly on monogamy necessarily, but non-monogamous people, not so.
This pressure on me to be happy with my partner‚Äôs other relationships and to be friends with metamours (the people your partner dates) made me anxious and unhappy. I forced myself to socially interact with people beyond my personal means.
I forced myself to be friends with people I had nothing in common with and it made me sarcastic towards them. Instead of just accepting that maybe I don‚Äôt really need to be friends with metamours, I forced myself into it which inevitably made the situation tense and difficult anyways.
Furthermore, I felt like my indifference to my partner‚Äôs romantic exploits made me heartless and even somehow ‚Äòjealous‚Äô. And in fact, listening to details of my partner‚Äôs exploits stood my hair on end ‚Äî not because I was jealous or bothered ‚Äî but because the fear that I would become jealous was so intense it made me just as uncomfortable as jealousy would ‚Äî maybe even MORE uncomfortable. I would only realise later that my discomfort in being a voyeur had a lot to do with the sexual abuse I‚Äôd survived and nothing to do with feeling jealous at all.
I had to accept that compersion just might not be something I felt and hearing the details just made me anxious about being jealous ‚Äî and that was okay. I didn‚Äôt have to feel compersion to be happy for my partner on a wider scale. And I didn‚Äôt have to get along with or even like my metamours for things to be okay between any partner I had. Obviously, yeah, if we were to be friendly and when I am friendly with a metamor it is nice... but forcing myself to be friends with anyone in any situation is never comfortable and that‚Äôs just fine.
Compersion isn‚Äôt compulsory.
Non-monogamous beginners hear multiple times a day that ‚Äòlove is infinite‚Äô and it‚Äôs not necessarily wrong. While you may be able to love an infinite number of people, you only have so much energy in a day. As a person with a disability that affects my energy levels and social anxiety, I quickly realised that going out on a new date every night wasn‚Äôt something that I could physically do, and that‚Äôs okay.
I also found that a lot of people who espoused a ‚Äòlove is infinite‚Äô philosophy had many privileges they took for granted that I didn‚Äôt have. They had careers (or the ability to live fine without one) with flexible time options, the money to spend on activities, the mental and physical energy to socially interact with people without going to a breaking point.
One time I can recall, I went to an open relationships event in a new city and the conference involved a lot of intense interpersonal social interaction. After being invited to a party, I accepted, despite being exhausted. I ended up in a very loud, strange, unfamiliar house without any proper place to sit away from the huge crowds of people and became so sensory overloaded, I ended up crying. I felt ridiculous, un-fun, ashamed of my inability to go with the flow of everyone else until I eventually realised that my resourses just weren‚Äôt where others were.
You can love however many people you want, but there are only 24 hours in a day. Not all of us can afford to live within walking distance of all of our partners or afford a job that doesn‚Äôt run us ragged most of the week. It would be great if time and resources were as infinite as love, but they just aren‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs helpful to realise that.
As I mentioned before, there is an unhealthy expectation on non-monogamous people to be happy about everything going on within their relationships. You‚Äôre put under this expectation, especially due to some of the beginner material you read, to enjoy every aspect of non-monogamy, to be fine with all of the activities your partners have with others, and to be fine on your own.
But sometimes, you can be lonely ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay. Sometimes when my partner who lives with me is out visiting someone else I may in theory be very happy for them, but I am alone at present. And sure, I have found out the best way to resolve this issue is to try and make plans at the same time so I have company, but that‚Äôs not always possible.
Time isn‚Äôt infinite, as I said before, and ultimately agreeing to a non-monogamous relationship means agreeing to a relationship structure where any individual you partner with does not and cannot reasonably spend all of their time with you.
Monogamy also has this type of setup when one partner has a time consuming job like being a lawyer or doctor. But within non-monogamy it‚Äôs guarantee that part and parcel of what you‚Äôre agreeing to is for your partner to not devote all of their time and energies towards you.
And this can get lonely. Especially if you‚Äôre in the very likely scenario that one person has loads of dates and the other doesn‚Äôt. It can get sad. And I think we spend so much time trying to stay happy for our partner that we shove this loneliness down, don‚Äôt talk about it, and then it ends up blowing up in our faces. Especially given the polyamorous community crab bucket mentality of, ‚Äòoh no, there‚Äôs to many stories about people struggling with non-monogamy, let‚Äôs talk about how awesome it is‚Äô.
Statistically, the more relationships you have the more likely it is for you to encounter heartbreak. And although that is a hazard of the trade, it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to pretend like you‚Äôre not heartbroken if and when you are or that you‚Äôre not scared of it.
Sometimes it‚Äôs not awesome. Sometimes you‚Äôre lonely. The important thing to remember in this case is the benefits you ultimately get out of non-monogamy as a choice and to take steps to try and handle that loneliness. Steps that acknowledge and recognise your feelings rather than shoving a grin on your face and trying to feel okay with it all. Because eventually, if our partners aren‚Äôt spending enough time with us for us to be happy, we won‚Äôt actually be able to realise that if we‚Äôre trying our best to not be unhappy and lying to ourselves about it.
Monogamy, specifically heterosexual monogamy, is encouraged by the society we live in. And when you‚Äôre just starting out having open relationships, you can feel a bit isolated. You will have experiences where people will judge you for it (specifically if you‚Äôre read as female) and a lot of times people can feel this combination where they are shunned by society, admired by some while simultaneously feeling that what they are doing is ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô.
You get a lot of mixed messages as a beginner in non-monogamous communities: It‚Äôs more natural than monogamy and yet it‚Äôs scorned and hated and yet it‚Äôs seen as ‚Äòcool‚Äô and ‚Äòhip‚Äô. And that in turn can make things somewhat confusing, especially when the same sorts of conventions you see in monogamy seem to be still at play within non-monogamy.
For example, in a lot of non-monogamous settings I know, I see a lot of self-identified women in polyamorous families doing the majority of the child rearing or sharing child rearing between women partners while the men go out and do what they‚Äôd like. I see a lot of women stretching themselves providing emotional support for multiple people and getting nothing for themselves. I see a lot of situations where older men are using non-monogamy as an example of their ‚Äòfeminism‚Äô, dating multiple people who are much younger than they are and no one in their actual age bracket. You‚Äôll find a lot of convention within unconventionality.
Also, I find that people tend to have selective memories about history. Even within monogamous people, you have this concept that 50s era 2.5 kids with picket fences zeitgeist family is ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô and has been happening for years and years ‚Äî but this just isn‚Äôt true.
Romantic love and the idea that it‚Äôs not a sickness that needs to be cured is a relatively new idea in human history. Marriage being a symbol of love and not an exchange of property between families is a relatively new idea. Partnerships in life in decades past were not usually about love and sex, they were about wealth and power.
And in some cases even today people practice arranged marriage situations which aren‚Äôt necessarily problematic whereby a marriage is secured and a partnership forms out of a common need rather than what we would consider ‚Äòtypical‚Äô now of two individuals meeting and falling in love.
And ‚Äòaffairs‚Äô have not historically been a problem. Having multiple ‚Äòpartners‚Äô within socially sanctioned monogamy has been possible for wealthy men for hundreds of years. Maybe someone had a ‚Äòmarriage‚Äô, but that has never always meant sexual exclusivity. Or even if it has, that sexual exclusivity has purely been imposed on the person read as a woman within that exchange ‚Äî but very rarely for the men.
Not to mention, so many beginner non-monogmous guides are written from the perspective that the nuclear family was a reality for all of the individuals reading it while many poor and immigrant individuals may have never had that experience or expectation. Living jointly with family members, especially elders, is a common practice for a lot of people. So this idea that non-monogamy is defying all of the traditional conventions... well, it just isn‚Äôt.
Which is not to say feelings of loneliness aren‚Äôt valid or that there aren‚Äôt people who genuinely will dislike you for being non-monogamous. I will say though that ‚Äòopen relationships‚Äô aren‚Äôt necessarily completely unknown to mainstream culture and although there may be many misconceptions about them, there is yet to be a slur developed specifically for non-monogamous people.
And in my experience the vast majority of individuals who experience negative consequences for dating multiple people tend to be experiencing those consequences because they are read as women. People read as men can be judged by other men for ‚Äúallowing‚Äù their wives to sleep with other men, but this isn‚Äôt an anti-male consequence as the roots of this judgement stem from the idea that men need to be sexually dominant of the women they date and that women are subduing men by owning their own sexuality ‚Äî which is misogyny and ultimately about putting women back in their place, not about hating men or open relationships.
So the point of this is that, even while non-monogamy may be ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô, there are still plenty old conventional habits that pop up within it.
Eurocentric/white societies in general reinforce the idea of the individual as more important. We are encouraged in many ways to shine on our own, pull ourselves up by our ‚Äòbootstraps‚Äô, and not rely on others for help. Within non-monogamy, the reinforcement of the idea of being independent and allowing your partners to have independence means you often have this concept re-ingrained into you.
The advice so often given to beginners about jealousy is that they have to work it out themselves. In many cases, I find myself trying to handle everything on my own because I am worried about not only being a burden to my partners but also worried about making them feel I rely on them too much. I‚Äôve been encouraged to be self-sufficient to the point where asking for help becomes really difficult.
Sometimes it feels like it‚Äôs so not okay to have needs of your own, especially emotional ones, that it becomes another obstacle in asking for what you need. Because you don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòclingy‚Äô or be seen in a negative light within non-monogamy. Where monogamy is often characterised as unhealthy co-dependence, anything that seems to echo or reflect that can often be seen as just as negative. And when your relationships aren‚Äôt following an already culturally defined script of boundaries and what means what, you‚Äôre often left wondering who you can really ask for emotional support.
No one is actually an island though. We‚Äôre social creatures, even me who‚Äôs about as un-social as you can get. Sometimes we need help. And the people we feel comfortable enough to be romantic with are sometimes the people we feel safe asking for help from, moreso than others. And that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not clingy to have needs. And while your partners may not be your therapists and relying on any one individual for all of your emotional support may not be fair, ultimately you can‚Äôt help the things that you need. And pretending like you can take care of yourself all alone isn‚Äôt actually going to work.
When I first started out within non-monogamous communities, I was, like most people, nervous and hopeful I would make a good impression. I also had a bit of rose tinted glasses, hoping to be around people who understood me and the choices I wanted to make. I barely recognised until it was a little too late that the communities that I particularly entered were full of people who had completely different life experiences than me.
Some communities of non-monogamous people, and indeed many other communities you‚Äôll find, aren‚Äôt always the most diverse places and that can often leave you comparing yourself and your life to people who just don‚Äôt share the same experiences and understanding as you.
In my experience, feeling like I was the only non-binary person for example, was harsh. My feelings about being misgendered were often dismissed and glossed over. I‚Äôve heard within a meeting of non-monogamous people that polyamorous people just don‚Äôt have the time to concern themselves about transphobia and transmisogyny because they‚Äôre too busy with other things.
Diverse non-monogamous communities exist, but you have to sometimes go looking for them. If you find yourself feeling a bit isolated in yours, that may be for a reason. Take a look around and ask yourself if the only thing you really have in common is non-monogamy and if that‚Äôs actually going to hinder you instead of helping you.
If jealousy is the scarlet ‚ÄòJ‚Äô of non-monogamy, then insecurity is definitely its horrible cousin. People often will advise newcomers to work on their insecurities, to challenge them and to reassure themselves that they are worthy and worthwhile.
And this approach... might work. But what so many non-monogamy beginner guides leave out is the idea that being insecure can be a completely logical reaction to a given scenario and they very often assume insecurity is self-hate, when the two are not one in the same.
Insecurity is just that ‚Äî a lack of feeling secure. And when you‚Äôre starting a new relationship with someone, you may feel very insecure about the relationship and what you mean to each other. That makes a lot of sense. Feeling insecure in that situation doesn‚Äôt mean you assume that the person you‚Äôre starting the relationship with doesn‚Äôt like you, but that you‚Äôre not feeling secure about your relationship.
Likewise, I‚Äôve seen so many situations where people are kicking themselves for feeling insecure in a relationship (and ‚Äòjealous‚Äô) when it‚Äôs totally rational for them to feel insecure.
For example, say one partner has repeatedly broken promises to the other and then found a new hookup and the other partner is insecure about the new hookup. And the entire reason for that is because their relationship isn‚Äôt stable. If you have a partner who is not doing anything to make you feel valued and wanted or is in fact proving that you aren‚Äôt valued through action, you can tell yourself how awesome you are all you‚Äôd like ‚Äî it still won‚Äôt solve the actual problem or insecurity.
Insecurity isn‚Äôt something that happens always because you hate yourself or you think you‚Äôre unworthy. An Olympic athlete could feel insecure about their performance but still understand that their athletic performance is above average. Someone can have 50 Oscars for their acting work but still feel insecure when they go to an audition. We fear the unknown. We fear bad things happening. And that fear can cause insecurity. And we often mistake fear and insecurity for jealousy when it isn‚Äôt.
Self-hate is when you tell yourself that you‚Äôre not good enough, that your partners secretly hate you, and all of the other negative things that people sometimes experience. And the solution to this is to try and talk to yourself positively and stop attacking yourself. And self-hate can and does indeed cause you to feel insecure in a lot of things, relationships included. But not all insecurity is caused by self-hate.
It‚Äôs complicated because if your partner, for example, is neglecting you, you may hate yourself for feeling like you need more time with them. You may talk yourself down and say that you‚Äôre too clingy, too needy and that you need to pull yourself together. But maybe your partner isn‚Äôt actually spending as much time as you as an individual need from them. Maybe your partner missed an important birthday.
So you may feel temporarily better by trying to remind yourself of how much you are loved and how much you matter... but if your partner is neglecting you and not meeting the needs you have, you‚Äôre just going to be stuck in a cycle of just trying to stay afloat. Assuming your problems are all insecurity that needs to be dealt with by you reassuring yourself and not an inherent problem within the relationship of an unmet need or even neglect will just cause you to stay trapped in this cycle forever.
Don‚Äôt assume that your insecurity is always about self-hate. Sometimes it‚Äôs a sign that your needs aren‚Äôt being met. And even though not all people have the same needs and maybe you do in fact need more than others in some situations, if your relationships are going to work, your partners need to be willing to meet those needs if they can.
You may have to come to the conclusion that you‚Äôre not as compatible as you‚Äôd like to be, but it‚Äôs better to come to that conclusion than to perpetuate a relationship where you, at the end of the day, aren‚Äôt getting what you want and instead are just trying to pep talk your way through it.
‚ÄòI don‚Äôt need no stinkin‚Äô rules‚Äô, as you might have heard. Also hierarchies where you have a primary partner reflect non-monogamy and end up giving ‚Äòcouples privilege‚Äô to two people, hurting the secondary. All of this is bad, bad, bad, baaaaaad.
Except not.
It‚Äôs ironic how many people who say they don‚Äôt need rules expect their partners to practice safe sexual practices as a rule, but somehow don‚Äôt seem to see using barriers and getting tested as ‚Äòrule‚Äô, but instead ‚Äòcommon sense‚Äô. And yet an individual‚Äôs idea of what is ‚Äòrisky‚Äô sex can really vary wildly between people.
Especially given how so many people are just uninformed about sexual health risk that they are unaware that STI transmission is STILL possible, even using condoms. One of the reasons sex educators are saying ‚Äòsafer‚Äô sex instead of ‚Äòsafe‚Äô sex is precisely because of that misunderstanding.
I tend to take the Jack Sparrow approach to non-monogamy. The only rules that matter are these: What you can do and what you can‚Äôt do.
I can let my partners date whomever they like, but I can‚Äôt say that if they were to date someone who‚Äôs been abusive and nasty to me it wouldn‚Äôt affect my feelings towards them.
I can let my partners do whatever they‚Äôd like, but I can‚Äôt pretend like missing my birthday or something that‚Äôs important to me wouldn‚Äôt make me upset.
I can let my partners define their own boundaries, but I can‚Äôt, for example, see my partner abuse or hurt someone else and pretend like I‚Äôm fine with that.
Everyone has individual needs within their relationships, and that goes for all things. Any parent would tell you that each kid they have (or even teacher) is different, each individual needing different things. Sometimes you need different things from different people, but those needs become your boundaries and things that you want to deal with.
And part of the reason rules and hierarchies aren‚Äôt inherently bad is because they can help support those needs ‚Äî so long as you aren‚Äôt trying to control the uncontrollable.
So for example, I enjoy doing domestic things with partners. I prefer to have a partner who lives with me and where we establish a life together, maybe by getting a house together. The ideal type of non-monogamy that works for me is one where I have a ‚Äòprimary‚Äô partner I can trust to ask for emotional support and where I have other partners who are more casual and who would give the same amount of emotional support I would expect a friend to give me. This is what works for me and more or less is what works for my primary partner, which is why we have that type of relationship.
My partner does have more of a drive for casual relationships whereas I‚Äôm not as bothered if I don‚Äôt go out on a date for months. This is a situation that works for us both. And we communicate that to other people so we manage expectations. And in many cases, both in my experience as a primary partner and as a secondary who‚Äôs been discarded the moment I became inconvenient, having a clear understanding of expectations is what made things a lot better. Especially as an autistic person who needs clarity.
The problem with rules and hierarchies and why so much of the beginner non-monogamy advice will rail against them is because often people use rules and hierarchies to solve other problems that rules cannot solve.
You‚Äôll often find situations where one person has convinced their partner to do non-monogamy and they create a hierarchy and rules (e.g. you can‚Äôt sleep with someone until I say you can or we can‚Äôt have dates until both of us have one) to try and protect themselves against the fear of the unknown. And that‚Äôs understandable but the problem with rules is that the more you make, the more likely it will be that someone will forget and break one or that situations in life will create problems.
What beginner non-monogamy advice should do instead of unilaterally saying all rules and hierarchies are bad is instead expand on those rules which are likely to blow up in people‚Äôs faces.
For example, creating a rule that your partner has to check with you before sleeping with someone new is something I always advise against. Anything where one person gives ‚Äòpermission‚Äô creates a lot of pressure not only on the person giving permission to say yes to please their partner but also can create resentment if permission isn‚Äôt given.
And sometimes when casual situations arise, you may end up deciding to sleep with someone new at 1 AM in the morning, in which case telling your partner that you‚Äôre going to sleep with someone new could create more problems than it can solve, especially if your partner is having a rough day. Imagine missing your train, spilling your lunch, ruining an outfit, missing your partner, eating dinner alone and then being woken up at 1 AM by your partner calling to tell you they‚Äôre about sleep with someone else.
Yeah. Not so great.
The fear behind making this rule is an attempt to try and make sure that partners check in with each other to make sure they‚Äôre okay. And that doesn‚Äôt need to happen just before and can happen after. Instead of making a rule to enforce this kind of behaviour, what one should do is trying and create an atmosphere where your partner does check in with you, regardless of new partners or not, and makes sure your mental health is okay and where you feel comfortable telling your partner when it isn‚Äôt.
A rule enforced like this will not automatically create that type of atmosphere, so the rule isn‚Äôt going to help and may instead create more problems than it solves. I‚Äôd advise people to think about why they are making the rule and examine the reasoning behind it.
Last but not least, the advice so often not given to newbies is plainly: maybe non-monogamy just isn‚Äôt for you.
A lot of beginner non-monogamy writing is made with rose tinted eye implants, practically. Non-monogamy has a way of defying some of the things that are inherent but not exclusive to monogamy. Sometimes it can be freeing to feel like you can flirt without ‚Äòcheating‚Äô or do what you‚Äôd like. And that in turn makes people feel like non-monogamy is inherently better, inherently more egalitarian, inherently more socially progressive than monogamy.
And it can get to the point where non-monogamous people refer to monogamy derisively, almost blaming it instead of structures like misogyny and heterosexism for the way monogamy has kept them in a box.
That in turn can make people feel like the only egalitarian, ethical and socially progressive choice people can make IS non-monogamy. And like communism, non-monogamy can seem great on paper, but not work in practice for many people ‚Äî AND THAT IS OKAY.
As I said before, accepting non-monogamy means ultimately accepting that any one partner you have will not spend the entirety of their time and resources on you and visa versa. And maybe that‚Äôs not setup you want. Maybe that doesn‚Äôt work for you. Maybe having more people is just too complicated. Or maybe you‚Äôre just too damn tired to date more than one person.
All of this is okay. Choosing monogamy doesn‚Äôt mean you choose everything that society can tack on with it. Choosing monogamy doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll flip out if your partner notices someone else. It doesn‚Äôt mean you have a problem with your partner having sexual feelings or romantic feelings for someone else. Assuming that someone just being monogamous means they endorse society‚Äôs ideas about what monogamy should look like is a huge false equivalency.
That‚Äôs like me assuming as a non-binary person that any binary identified human being, trans or cis, automatically by identifying as a binary gender endorses everything that society tacks onto that gender ‚Äî and it‚Äôs just not true.
You may try non-monogamy and find it isn‚Äôt what you want, and that‚Äôs cool. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre backwards or want to live in the 50s. It may just mean it isn‚Äôt your cup of tea. And you‚Äôd think among ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô people, even that would be tolerated but sometimes it isn‚Äôt.
So that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm sure there will be more when I think about it some more, but for now, if I had known this before I started out, it would have saved me a lot of heartbreak and I‚Äôm hoping that for some beginners out there it helps them too.

Sunny Alphonsus Akpan|4|4|https://medium.com/@sunnyalphonsusakpan/grace-to-be-a-lady-3bc454dced0d?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|Grace to be a Lady ‚Äì Sunny Alphonsus Akpan ‚Äì Medium|"It seems she is missing. It was announced over the radio and a TV commercial break ran the Ad.
Some say she might be holed up somewhere uninterested in modern activities. Maybe she is disguised. Disguised for her security. Hidden from the undiscerning eyes.
So the search begins in earnest. It is an ultimate search. The challenge is thrown. Capable men are dared to pick up the gauntlet and go for the search. It‚Äôs a journey to the unknown.
‚ÄúWho can find...?‚Äù Sounds like a dare. Is our ability to find her questioned? What do we do to prove that we can find her? It is germane that we build the needed muscles and get fit for this exercise. Time to get going, the clock is ticking.
The onus is on the man. He must be strong to find her. Equipped to handle her. Mature to lead her. Stable to steady her. Secure to cheer her.
‚ÄúWho can find a virtuous woman?‚Äù Okay, a little description will suffice. She had been described. But pray! The question seems to depict a scarcity of the original. But they are all around us, in different colours, shapes and sizes.
It is probable that a dubious mutation traverse our planet. Who caused the mutation? What pressures and circumstantial fires created the disjointed molds? What molestations numbed their souls? What violence hardened their hearts? What betrayals caused the distrust? Questions and more questions, still the issues persist.
Who pushed her, Who chased her away? Why is she in hiding? Why did we stop celebrating her virtue? Why did we downplay her tenderness and fragility?
Her femininity is undermined on the platform of solipsism. Her personality reduced to an object to be toyed with and abused.
So she stays hidden to protect her sanctity. She runs to self, drugs, sex and abusive relationships in an effort to escape the horrid couch of unacceptance. These and the likes are insidious nostrums that flatter to deceive. Forceful subjection to a purblind stewardship does her no good.
If only she knows. In God she finds her identity and revels in her purpose.
The real lady is not only to be described as a perfect ten (10) or a figure eight (8). Her hips, lips, fingertips and curves may spark fires in a man. Yet, ‚Äúthe fear of the Lord‚Äù is her most important asset. For when her beauty expires with age and her charms disappear after a season, her ‚Äúinward man‚Äù will bring her praise and keep her in the news. Though her gait is graceful and her disposition classy, her grace is a gift from her God.
9 And I want women to get in there with the men in humility before God, not primping before a mirror or chasing the latest fashions
10 but doing something beautiful for God and becoming beautiful doing it. 1 Timothy 2 (MSG)
The most beautiful women are those who are out there serving God and blessing lives!
So where is the lady, where is her dwelling?
In God! She can only be found in Him. This is her place of rest and renewal.
In Him she finds stability and stamina. That is her centre. From there she gains her balance and navigates the befuddling bundle of changes that characterises her person. The God position is where her real identity emanates from. For only her God can heal the scars and traumas of the sordid and sombre events of the past. Then she is liberated to play her roles with tenderness in her hands and fight in her heart.
She is classy, disciplined and dignified. She is beautiful on the inside, charming on the outside. She is influential and dependable. She possesses rectitude and is talented on different fronts. Her presence is comforting and her price is PRICELESS.
He gives grace that breeds graceful ladies.
So let God‚Äôs leading ladies stand up to be counted. Let them stand on the hills and shine the light of feminine dignity and grace. Let their sense of history and purpose lift them above the mundane considerations that drown ordinary people. Let what the blood of Jesus did be bigger than all that anybody has done to them.
You are a pristine beauty. You are a gracious lady.
You will soar!

Kris Gage|45K|4|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-to-really-know-youre-in-love-d8d433a0f0bf?source=tag_archive---------0---------------------|How to *really* know you‚Äôre in love ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Because most of ‚Äúthe signs‚Äù they tell you are garbage
Because it‚Äôs mostly shit advice.
Here‚Äôs a small sampling:
This is infatuation.
If someone‚Äôs ‚Äúalways‚Äù on your mind, you‚Äôre not focused on other Really Important Things. And that‚Äôs a problem.
Real love fits into real life, rather than usurping it. It‚Äôs calm, not overwhelming.
See above.
Ditto.
Well, I mean, damn. You fantasize long and hard enough, you can see anything in your future ‚Äî like I could imagine moving to Switzerland to be a goat farmer. That doesn‚Äôt mean I should.
The problem is that we‚Äôve made ‚Äúlove‚Äù into a game of escapism, and measure potential partners by how they fit into that fantasy. That‚Äôs not love.
So, sure, see them in your future ‚Äî but not because they ‚Äúcomplete the picture.‚Äù
See above.
Ha. Hahaha. Clearly you have never been in a (healthy) long-term relationship.
You should usually want to see bae. But love isn‚Äôt always wanting to. Sometimes you need a minute. Sometimes you need to work or do other things. Or, damn, just be.
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs not love just because sometimes you want space.
Well. That‚Äôs scary.
Y u tryin so hard? Loving isn‚Äôt ‚Äúimpressing.‚Äù
Healthy love doesn‚Äôt involve fear of loss. That‚Äôs attachment.
It also doesn‚Äôt involve fear of ‚Äúnever being with another woman.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know what that is. Low self esteem? Lack of conviction?
This is attachment again, not mature love.
This is self-love, not love. (Also: you‚Äôre an idiot.)
Well. Glad you‚Äôre getting your emotional needs met.
But this just means that they are deserving of love. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you are loving them.
Well. Thanks for the most unhelpful advice ever.
To everyone who‚Äôs ever said this: y tho? pls stahp.
Don‚Äôt perpetuate nonsense and call it ‚Äúromance‚Äù just because you don‚Äôt have suitable answers.
The difference here is probably what the rest of your day looks like.
Good: If you‚Äôre happy with your life and your partner adds to it, then congrats. You win.
Bad: If you‚Äôre unhappy and using your partner as an oasis, then you need to get your shit together.
Good: you actually care about their wants and needs, and prioritize them in a way that doesn‚Äôt tear you down
Bad: you compromise your own wants and needs, or base your value on your ability to ‚Äúkeep them happy.‚Äù
Rad for them
Congrats, there may be hope for you yet.
Great. I want happiness for most people.
You found someone with whom you‚Äôre comfortable, and whose company you enjoy. Good on you.
Role models have that effect on us, too. That doesn‚Äôt mean we love them.
You don‚Äôt feel love. You DO it. It‚Äôs an act, not a feeling. It‚Äôs a moment by moment decision and re-commitment. You know because it‚Äôs deliberate and conscious.
You invest. You exert effort.
You don‚Äôt knowingly do harm. You aren‚Äôt vengeful, petty, manipulative, or jealous. Their needs never seem irritating. You aren‚Äôt grabby with them, their time, or their affection in return. You are secure without demanding constant reassurance.
You prioritize their viewpoints. You learn their love language. You think in terms of their interests, not yours, and their needs are your own. You support them. You back them. You care and take care. You accept, and you allow.
Because everyone thinks they‚Äôre in love when it‚Äôs clear skies and calm waters, but watch them when the storm hits.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre pissed. It‚Äôs love if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúfight;‚Äù you disagree.
You love if your objective is reaching an agreement, not picking a winner.
You love if you don‚Äôt get defensive, insecure, or manipulative. If you don‚Äôt keep score. If you don‚Äôt hold grudges. If you don‚Äôt ‚Äútake back your love‚Äù as punishment.
You love if you seek to understand before being understood; listen and honor what they share ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt double down with your own issues. If you act like you‚Äôre on the same team. You listen. You compromise. You apologize. You forgive.
You know because you love even when you‚Äôre hurt. Especially honoring and respecting their wants and needs even when they include ‚Äúbreaking up.‚Äù
We like to differentiate between ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù and ‚Äúloving‚Äù someone. But ‚Äúbeing in love with‚Äù is infatuation, and infatuation means nothing in getting real love.
So if what you want is real love, then ‚Äúhow to‚Äù is all that matters.
You ‚Äúknow‚Äù because you decide. It‚Äôs love when you do it. All the time.

Jessica Wildfire|8.5K|5|https://medium.com/@JessicaLexicus/my-first-orgasm-at-age-30-b81210a6c0ed?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|My first orgasm at age 30+ ‚Äì Jessica Wildfire ‚Äì Medium|"Orgasms don‚Äôt come easily to everyone. My first one happened last weekend, after years of fucking the same person. Before that, I fucked different people with disappointing results. Maybe this one‚Äôs magic, or maybe there‚Äôs a better explanation.
It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve dated beneath me, either. I‚Äôve shared beds with super seriously attractive, smart, cultured, and successful people. This fact may shock you, but I‚Äôve learned something from loads of breakups. The overall attractiveness of your partner may not play the key role in your sexual health, or the strength of your relationship.
You might date plenty of smart, attractive, successful people you get along with. Sadly, for some reason maybe you just can‚Äôt open up to them. You date them and date them, and you just can‚Äôt let yourself go when they‚Äôre around. It actually isn‚Äôt them. Or you. It‚Äôs somewhere in the middle.
The essential ingredients to my orgasm include mutual respect, trust, honesty, comfort, and acceptance. I‚Äôve learned that if you can‚Äôt let your guard down, then your sex will remain an illusion. Maybe a fun illusion. But still a work of imagination. A fantasy without substance.
The person who can make you orgasm is the person who doesn‚Äôt run away after seeing your nightmare self. For me, that didn‚Äôt happen until a few years ago. In truth, I‚Äôve got a lot of inner twisted. He‚Äôs seen it, and chosen to stay. The person who runs? That person can‚Äôt give you an orgasm. Unless you‚Äôve had a different experience. If so, let me know.
I‚Äôm over 30. I‚Äôve had plenty of sex, just a late bloomer in terms of the petite mort. What changed? I had to let out all my ugly insides. That took a little while. For some people, it takes a long time to open everything up.
Before you ask, yes. I‚Äôve been dumped for my lack of bedroom sass. So I watched some porn and learned how to act like I was enjoying sex. But you can only keep that up for so long.
It‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt enjoy sex. I mean, I‚Äôve always liked the idea. I‚Äôm liberal, not prudish. But your biochemistry lies at a less conscious level. Sometimes, I‚Äôve felt like my brain didn‚Äôt even have access to my desires. As much as I‚Äôd like it to be true, sex is not an intellectual process. It‚Äôs the opposite.
Some people equate sex and dancing. No, not even close. Trust me, you can fake good dancing. You can take dance lessons. Sex lessons? Harder to come by. But simulating sex was never my problem.
Feeling it? Completely different.
Sex always felt nice, and sometimes I could even fool my partners into thinking I‚Äôd lost myself in the moment. Maybe normal people don‚Äôt have to teach themselves how to enjoy sex, to lose themselves.
Most animals just slide right into the nasty. But I‚Äôm fucked up. So I had to figure myself out first.
Vulnerability. I‚Äôve spent my entire life hiding my feelings. In high school, I lied to my friends all the time about my mom‚Äôs mental health. Let‚Äôs say she was having an especially bad week, and decided on a whim that I couldn‚Äôt go to a friend‚Äôs party. She would smash glasses all night long, spewing nonsense about rape and venereal diseases. My dad would pull me into another room and beg. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you hang out at home?‚Äù He just wanted my mom to stop screaming, so we could sleep.
So I‚Äôd call my friends and make up a story. My parents had grounded me over bad grades. They were going to make me study all weekend.
Every week, I made up stories and excuses for my mom‚Äôs behavior. The better I got at lying, the better my friends got at believing me.
I even learned how to lie to adults. Teachers. Social workers. Myself. Someone should‚Äôve given me an award.
Sex and lies. Years later, I saw the connection. All of my problems in relationships, especially sex, lay there. You can‚Äôt enjoy intimacy in the bedroom, if you can‚Äôt even tell your friends the truth about simple things. My skills at lying transferred easily into adulthood. Instead of talking about my feelings, or sharing details about myself, I just lied. I made up a different me with no baggage.
That different me could charm anyone. I made a great date. But fake me sucked in the bedroom. You can pretend to be anyone you want on a date. When it comes to sex, you have to be yourself. For a long time, I refused to admit that.
Throughout my 20s, I had pretend sex. I‚Äôd kiss and moan for my partner. Even when my actions felt fake, I went through the motions. But pretend sex only leads to pretend orgasms.
Pretend friends. Pretend romance. Pretend sex. Pretend orgasms.
That‚Äôs how life works.
Funny how long it took me to learn. In the end, I just got lucky. I found someone who accepted me, with all my flaws.
What flaws, you ask? Picture it, a year ago I let out a visceral scream and threw a glass against the wall. He came into the room thinking we were under a home invasion.
I looked up and pouted. ‚ÄúMy computer‚Äôs frozen.‚Äù
That‚Äôs it, I thought. Another relationship bites the blade. But instead we had this tender moment, before the neighbors came to check on us. ‚ÄúWe heard this blood curdling scream,‚Äù one of them said. ‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù
We convinced them nobody had died, and watched a comedy special. An hour later, I realized I hadn‚Äôt broken the glass because my computer had frozen. I‚Äôd been on edge all day after listening to my dad narrate his frustrations with the state‚Äôs mental health system. My mom‚Äôs problems were draining his retirement fund. Ah, how the mind works.
At first, I couldn‚Äôt believe someone could actually love all the bad shit about me ‚Äî all the baggage, all the misdirected rage. But it happened. And for some of us, you can‚Äôt reach happiness in bed until you find someone who can help you take out all your garbage.
Either that, or a really great vibrator.
Or a shower head with advanced settings.
Plus, we developed unprecedented levels of honesty. I‚Äôm talking about my spouse now, not the shower head.
We actually had conversations about things we did and didn‚Äôt like in bed. Nobody had ever done that before. We read articles and watched videos. In some ways, it was like DIY sex therapy.
Each time got better, easier, more natural. Despite momentary setbacks, we leveled up over time, and began to edge closer to climax.
Finally, the hard work and patience paid off. My first real orgasm didn‚Äôt end with fireworks. But we felt good. I laughed out loud. Laughter from relief, that I was alive after all. Only small things changed in terms of our choreography. What mattered was the intimacy. After that, I resisted the initial urge to text all my friends and post on Facebook. No, that was the old Jessica ‚Äî the one who simply wanted to prove an illusion. The new me simply reveled in the moment. Everyone has their own path to ecstasy. I‚Äôve found mine. Hopefully, you‚Äôll find yours. (If you haven‚Äôt.)

I Love You|"There is not a woman in existence who doesn‚Äôt shit test. It‚Äôs part of our make up. We are rarely aware, in the midst of a shit test, that we are doing it. It‚Äôs organic. I believe this comes from a woman‚Äôs deep need for security. Due to our natural and biological vulnerabilities we seek protection and security. Shit tests come out of this chronic insecurity. They serve a purpose for us as we use them to ‚Äútest the waters‚Äù to make sure that what existed before still exists. More secure women will test their reality, the solidity of the walls, the availability of resources, the protection and comfort of her man less frequently than a more insecure woman. An insecure woman might test constantly. But all women will test. It will never end. It‚Äôs best to learn how to deal with it instead of fighting it or fighting with the women you love over it.
Sometimes, if we are self-aware and open to thinking critically about ourselves and our actions we can recognize that the fight we picked or the probing question we asked served no purpose at all except as a shit test.
I shit test, sometimes intentionally, but mostly as a reaction or to fill an emotional need that I don‚Äôt quite understand yet. Shit tests are always meant to provoke a response in a man but the source of the problem is always an inner conflict that I haven‚Äôt acknowledged yet. Yeah, life is unfair.
Very often, women do not know what we are feeling in the moment. Our emotions can be intense and even conflicting. Especially now that we have a culture that tries to tell us we are certain ways or are supposed to reject certain things, we feel inadequate or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù when we feel something different. That creates an inner conflict between what we are experiencing and what we think we should be experiencing. That conflict creates a sense of instability as well as a layer of doubt, fear and shame that we are not what we are ‚Äúsupposed to be.‚Äù
Many of these feelings are buried and they come out in surprising, often unproductive ways. One of these ways is the shit test in part because we‚Äôve been told that the origin of our suffering is men (a newer phenomenon) and also because we look to the men in our lives to resolve our problems, even our emotional problems (likely a tendency since the beginning of time).
So, when we are attached to a man we admire or need, we see him as both the cause and solution to our problems. But our problems are not tangible. Our biggest problem is our internal conflict of wanting to feel safe and secure but being biologically insecure on some level.
The shit test is an emotional outburst to gauge if our problem is caused by or can be resolved by the man. However, the shit test is not the problem. It is a symptom of the problem. And like the symptoms of a disease, you can treat the symptoms for temporary relief but if you never address the underlying cause, you will eventually die. Further, fixing the shit test is a red herring; it is a trap. If you respond to the shit test in any way, if you attempt to answer or repair the shit test in any way, you have failed. Because the shit test is a trap to say, ‚ÄúCan I count on you?‚Äù
A woman‚Äôs insecurity and a man‚Äôs ability to tend to it appropriately is the foundation of a relationship‚Äôs success. If you get a woman with a stronger foundation, you will have less work, but there is no foundation that doesn‚Äôt require any maintenance at all. All foundations require reinforcement.
The only appropriate response to a shit test is to dismiss it. You can not take the question seriously. You should not taking responsibility in any way (the cause or the solution) for her inner conflict.
When you ‚Äúanswer‚Äù her shit test, you are acknowledging that there is a crack in the foundation. If you acknowledge the crack then you are liable to be responsible for it. You will be blamed for causing it and you will be made responsible for repairing it.
‚ÄúDo I look fat?‚Äù Classic shit test. A no answer opens possibility that you are lying. If she feels fat enough to ask then your answer is contradicting her feeling. And if your ‚Äúno‚Äù is not convincing enough to obliterate her feeling, she will be angry at you for lying.
A yes answer won‚Äôt help either.
The only way to respond to a shit test is to dismiss it or make a joke as if it‚Äôs ridiculous, but not to answer it either way. Teasing is always effective. Followed by escalating sexually to get her turned on. This also shows her the attention and confirmation of affection she is likely seeking more than an answer.
It is truly not the man‚Äôs problem that she has these inner conflicts. They are a result of our biology clashing with culture, the misinformation spread to women and it is foremost a result of our personal hormonal cocktail.
The solution, of course, is for her to understand her body chemistry better, her moods, her feelings and take personal responsibility for handling them. But even still, our emotions sometimes are several leaps ahead of our minds. So, understanding each other helps a lot too.
Women need to reject the current cultural teachings that tell us that men are the cause of all our problems, that tell us to reject our femininity and suppress our quirks. We must reject the notion that we are supposed to be always strong, steady and in control (aka masculine). In the meantime, helping men understand these shit tests, good ways to respond to them, maybe a little sympathy/empathy for her inner conflicts, is the best we can do.

Person 2: I can‚Äôt do this. I am not ready
Person 1: I love you
Person 2: Too late. I waited for too long to hear these words.
Person 1:I love you
Person 2: Oh my god me too!
Person 1: Let‚Äôs get married.
Person 2: Hold your horses. I love you but getting married is different.
These three words carry weight and meaning especially in romantic situations. Arguably, they mean different things to different people.
I: Me, my body, my mind, my soul, my heart, my ego, who I think I am. Wait who am I? Who knows?
Love: Impossible to define, but something around caring, attaching, addiction, accepting someone, can be healthy or unhealthy. Who knows?
You: Your body, what I project on you, the fantasies I have about you, how you make me feel, your personality, your being, your presence, your values. Who knows?
Confusing right?
To simplify my life, I thought of 10 alternatives to I love you, that feel more real. Feel free to share yours:
1- When I am with you, my body feels at peace
2- You meet my needs [insert needs]
3- I feel intense emotions for you, I am still figuring out what they are
4- The way you treat me, makes me feel accepted and cared for
5- Your presence makes me feel grateful about my life
6- The way you write / think / work / paint etc. inspire me to create / do / act
7- Being with you, helps me get to know myself better
8- My mind goes often into fantasy about you
9- I feel an urge to care for you, and provide you with affection both physical and emotional
10- We have a lot in common, including similar values, and it makes me wonder if we would make a good long term team

But you‚Äôre also thinking about moving on. You know that person has faults but your heart still tells you to go back, thinking about how good they are sometimes. You just want to be with that person again, for better or for worse. And guess what? More than 80% of us think of that when we break up.
Then you cry, and maybe even look up to the sky, maybe even pray and think, ‚ÄòPlease... Just let me get back with my ex. I hope my ex is just making a mistake and he/she wasn‚Äôt thinking it through. I know we are perfect for each other. I want to just call my ex up and say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù.‚Äô Then you look at your phone every half an hour, check your messenger, facebook, instagram, twitter, and heck... email inbox, to see if your ex would want to talk to you, all ready to get back together.
STOP. IT‚ÄôS ALL IN YOUR HEAD.
Guess what? Your ex wanted to break up with you because he/she thinks that something is wrong in your relationship. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs not going to work out.
Well, at least, your ex thinks that you‚Äôre not worth the effort.
Sorry to break it to you, honey, that‚Äôs the hard truth.
Remember my other post? Everyone has faults and problems. If your partner wants to breakup with you, it means that they don‚Äôt love you enough and don‚Äôt want to work things out with you.
So how can you get your ex back if they think you‚Äôre not worth it?
You need to make them feel you are worth it.
You need to increase your value.
You need to make them feel you‚Äôre too busy for them because (a) your life is wonderful (b) you have many people who would want to be with you.
As an example, imagine there‚Äôs a pair of shoes you could have got for $50. You quite like it, but you thought it was too expensive so you left. The next day, you passed by again and people started lining up in front of the store, just for those pair of shoes. The price of those shoes became $150. Would you feel like you‚Äôve missed out?
That‚Äôs exactly how we want your ex to feel.
That he/she missed out.
You need to make your ex feel that you love yourself. If you love yourself, people will love you, including your ex.
So here‚Äôs what you have to do:
While you are doing all these, don‚Äôt even try to think about your ex or what he/she would like. Do what YOU like. Be the best version of yourself.
I won‚Äôt be surprised if your ex starts contacting you again in whichever way. Most of them do.
And when he/she contacts you again, just treat them like an acquaintance, never treat them like an ex. Be nice. If you don‚Äôt feel that you‚Äôre ready to speak to him/her, then just ignore it. If they ask to meet, don‚Äôt do that because although you look all healed, I know it will still hurt when you meet again.
Don‚Äôt just start the relationship again after only a few calls/contact.
Afterall, your value is much higher now. Your ex is just another pursurer. Let them wait a while and take as much time as you want to evaluate the person again before you get back. You might even find someone who loves you more that your ex!
If you have any relationship questions, email me at tsevivien@gmail.com. I‚Äôll make your questions anonymous and reply in a new post.
P.S. Here‚Äôs my other post: How you can get over a breakup: 9 things to do

John Gorman|1.3K|5|https://medium.com/indian-thoughts/i-am-trying-to-break-your-heart-a4ecb9f7d466?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|I Am Trying To Break Your Heart. ‚Äì Thoughts And Ideas ‚Äì Medium|"I once knew this woman ... I believe her name was Camille.
She was a radiant presence in a room, a boundless fireball of beauty and brilliance, who shined the way the new phone does once you peel the plastic off the screen and start it up for the first time.
Anyway, Camille was a singer-songwriter who would just levitate on stage ‚Äî all humility and grace ‚Äî and belt out these sun-soaked melodies with earnest lyrics of longing, lust and chocolate. We liked her just fine.
She‚Äôd heard I‚Äôd traveled down the road that inevitably leads the ego in all of us to the stage. And we ping-ponged some forgettable dialogue before she asked me, sort of in context but sort of shoehorned, ‚ÄúHow can I get better?‚Äù
Now, listen, I‚Äôm not about to tell people to follow my path in music. For that career, I‚Äôm still trying to fight with family members on reconsidering the ‚ÄúDo Not Resuscitate‚Äù checkbox. But, there‚Äôs a common current underneath all art, and under the overlap in the Venn diagram where it intersects with the path your life takes.
I want to talk for a minute about Karma, and the backwards way we interpret it. Karma doesn‚Äôt mean what we think it does.
It‚Äôs often theorized by amateur philosophers, faux-woke bros and remedial artists that Karma is ‚Äúwhatever you put into the universe comes back to you.‚Äù That is Karma only with the lower-case k. It‚Äôs too micro. It‚Äôs too myopic. It‚Äôs wholly inaccurate. It‚Äôs the zero-sum mindset.
Life is not zero-sum. Life is an investment, not a transaction. When we think of karma (lower-case), we believe that our inputs will equal our returns. That is the selfish end of the Just World Hypothesis, and I don‚Äôt think you have to look too far into the abyss to understand the fallacy in that ‚Äî this world is not just. It is unjust. It is imbalanced. Ask anyone who‚Äôs been dealt a bad hand disproportionate to the cards they‚Äôve dealt others. And so, rather than interpret Karma as a system of debits and credits, we must realize that it is merely the inputs themselves, and the way they wash over the rest of the world.
For when we truly behave in Karmic fashion, we invest not expecting a return, but, rather, we give to foster a ripple effect: to bring about more love in the rest of the world, independently of whether we expect it to return. One good deed begets another. One good word starts a wave. One love-quake sparks a Tsunami. This is true Karma. We may be in the path of the oncoming storm, but we yet still shelter others ‚Äî winds and rain be damned. By giving, by loving, by acting, we restore balance to an ultimately tragic world where we all die and end up alone, no matter the progress we‚Äôve made.
Now let‚Äôs talk about Love. I don‚Äôt mean love in the sense of being in a relationship, I mean love in the sense of an unconditional and unrelenting compulsion to give the whole of yourself to others.
There are people on this planet who‚Äôve never had their hearts truly broken. They‚Äôve never held love in the palm of their hands, only to realize it is more liquid than solid, and never watched it helplessly drip out of their grip until it spills and seeps back into the ground from which it came. They‚Äôve merely bonded, they‚Äôve cautiously entered into a transaction: a transaction into which each gave something up, with the expectation of returns ‚Äî a partnership. Perhaps they formed it over an awkward first few dinners, or a spark-filled sojourn in the Maldives. This is lower-case love. The love that keeps you comfortable. The love that brings you fleeting joy. The love that doesn‚Äôt last so much as endure.
I know people who‚Äôve only loved once. I know people who married because they felt they were supposed to. I know people who work to pay the electric bill. I know people who make a living instead of live a life. I know people who are more data points than human. They‚Äôve never had their hearts broken: I envy them. And, more than that, I pity them.
When you break your heart, you cause the forest fire that springs the growth in the underbrush. When you break your heart, you scar the earth upon which you walk, and you allow the ivy to grow around it. When you break your heart, you begin to understand the decidedly un-transactional nature of the world we live in. You realize it doesn‚Äôt come back ‚Äî that it merely comes undone. We drift in and out, but the marks we leave are as real as the air we breathe.
The beauty around you, the impermanence and injustice of it all, closes in. It becomes clear that the twinge of tragic sadness that pockmarks existence is the one thing that makes you want to wake with the crows and listen to every chirp, feel every breeze. Everything you love will die. Everything you see will fade from memory. But holding the liquid of love in your hand, letting it flow to the level it needs, watching as it spills from your grasp and seeks its own level ‚Äî that is all that we have. It is the science and the art, the gift and the curse, the bug and the windshield.
I looked Camille square in the eye, her eyes still as earnest as the day she graduated high school with all the hope and dreams in the world. I watched her intently hang on my next breath. I thought back to the way she levitated as she sang about a man‚Äôs smile looking so much better with her lips upon it, and the way that a kiss is not a reciprocation so much as it is an attempt to reach into another‚Äôs soul and pull out what‚Äôs left of them to give back more of it, and that you‚Äôll never get it as good as you give it, you‚Äôll never give it as good as you feel it, and you‚Äôll never feel it as much as you want it.
I looked at Camille. I smiled. I gently touched her arm.
‚ÄúGet your fucking heart broken,‚Äù I told her.
‚ÄúThen, do it again.‚Äù
She left to grab another gin-and-tonic. And a part of me left with her.

John Gorman|162K|4|https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-3-keys-to-becoming-irresistible-d2f689ea4bf1?source=tag_archive---------1---------------------|The 3 Keys to Becoming Irresistible ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"There‚Äôs a routine question asked in job interviews, first dates, table games and so on: What is the most important thing you look for in other people?
There‚Äôs variations on this format (i.e. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the most attractive quality you look for in a potential partner?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your greatest strength?‚Äù And so on) but, in general, the answer remains the same: The character trait you hold above all. When pressed, I‚Äôve often stumbled and resorted to something trite and probably not true: honesty, humor, confidence, charisma, etc. Those are fine answers but they‚Äôre not in my estimation the correct ones.
And so one day I sat down on my pleather couch, brewed some holy basil tea, queued up some Anderson Paak on the Spotify and really, truly tried to whittle down the essence of what makes truly admirable, special people exactly that. I analyzed people I looked up to, people I was attracted to, and people I just couldn‚Äôt dream to be without. And I found that the answer could never be just one thing, and that many of the things I think I admire are manifestations of other, deeper things I admire more. Here are the three components that, when taken together, create a spellbinding supernova of a person ‚Äî one who can command a room and control their destiny, one who can be both altruistic and intelligent. And so I give them to you and make a case for each.
This trait is the root of all growth, learning and kindness. It‚Äôs the belief that you are not yet so great that your mind cannot be opened, and it‚Äôs the presence of mind to remember that we are all interconnected equals, and that injustice against one is an injustice against all. It is, flatly, an absence of entitlement. People who exhibit humility let their work speak for itself, they remain stoic in the face of their own suffering, and they remind themselves ‚Äî and others ‚Äî that life is fragile and therefore valuable. Humility quells ignorance and cultivates grace. I want this in the people I hold dear.
Without curiosity, you cannot be enthralling or even engaging, nor ‚Äî most rudimentary of all ‚Äî successful. It is frankly impossible. Curiosity drives an insatiable quest for knowledge, culture, novelty, experience, beauty, art and connection. It is the bedrock upon which you can build a life filled with stories, memories, accomplishments and relationships. People who exhibit curiosity can become masters, or polymaths, or auteurs ‚Äî but they must first always have an open mind. They first seek to listen, to absorb, to immerse, to traverse. The world is too large and their time on it too short to ever remain fully satisfied in their pursuit of whatever new ideas pass in front of them. I want people around me to remain curious, routinely examining the world through fresh eyes, and using their eyes to find fresh corners of the world.
This trait is the miracle drug of humanity (and elephants, and dolphins). It is the simplest, sweetest attribute one can possess, and the most worthwhile one worth cultivating for social success. Empathy brings people closer, and makes others feel understood and less alone inside. And if there is one thing we‚Äôre all looking to become a little less of, it‚Äôs alone. When I see truly empathetic people, I see people who genuinely care, but also people who remind us that sometimes it‚Äôs okay to be still with someone else and not invade their space or encroach their boundaries. This unique ability to understand the world through others‚Äô eyes and cut to the heart of what others are feeling and experiencing. Empathy breeds compassion, connection and love. It is an important precursor for honesty.
You may have noticed the three are closely related. This is no mere accident. In fact, when you stack humility, curiosity and empathy, you can easily see how they amplify each other.
Humility is the soul. Curiosity is the mind. Empathy is the heart.
Humility is how you value yourself. Curiosity is how you value your others. Empathy is how you value the bonds between yourself and others.
Humility is the soil of knowledge. Curiosity is the water that helps it grow. Empathy is the sunlight that shows us which way to bend.
And if you take any two without the third, you‚Äôre missing a crucial component: Humble, curious, apathetic people are slothful. Humble, disaffected, empathetic people are sensitive but not very interesting. Brash, curious, empathetic people are exhausting. But when you bring them all together, you create a benevolent triad.
These three traits are the key to becoming warm, smart and memorable. They‚Äôre irrepressible and irresistible. They‚Äôre my favorite qualities in others: the most attractive, the strongest, the most admirable. And whether I‚Äôm hiring them, dating them or learning from them, these are the qualities I look for above all others.

Anthony Moore|43K|8|https://medium.com/the-mission/why-most-people-will-never-have-great-relationships-bffc4152e978?source=tag_archive---------2---------------------|Why Most People Will Never Have Great Relationships|"Relationships are perhaps the most important foundation for your life.
If you have great relationships, there‚Äôs virtually nothing that can defeat you, or even discourage you. As prolific author Frank Crane once wrote, having a close friend ‚Äúdoubles every joy and halves every defeat.‚Äù
But if most of your relationships are shallow and superficial, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have the most ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù life imaginable ‚Äî everything still rings hollow if there‚Äôs no one to celebrate with.
As part of a recent study, The National Science Foundation (NSF) asked 1,500 people how many friends they had that they could talk with about their personal troubles or triumphs.
1 in 4 said they had no one to talk with. That number doubled when they took out family members.
Two thirds of Americans say they‚Äôve lost more than 90% of the friends they had 10 years ago. Many Americans can only claim to have 2 close friends ‚Äî maybe less.
Why do most people have mediocre relationships ‚Äî or none at all?
Why are most people on track to never have great relationships?
Because they can‚Äôt be bothered to learn how.
When my wife Kimi and I were in premarital counseling, we read a book called The 5 Love Languages. That little book has made us 1000x closer to each other.
Maybe you‚Äôve read the book before. In a nutshell, the book says every person loves, and wants to be loved, in 5 ways (with 1 or 2 main preferences):
Everyone loves ‚Äî and wants to be loved ‚Äî in these 5 ways. But the reason most people continue to have mediocre relationships is because they just can‚Äôt be bothered to learn how the other person wants to be loved.
Not knowing how your loved ones want to be loved is extremely dangerous. This is where the deepest, most profound disconnects can happen, things like:
Most people can‚Äôt be bothered to learn how to communicate with and love their friends/partner the way they want.
As long as you never learn how you want to receive love ‚Äî and learn how those around you want to receive it ‚Äî you‚Äôll always have mediocre relationships.
Communication is hard. It takes empathy, focus, and conscious effort to give your friend the attention they need.
But isolation and loneliness are far harder.
The reason your relationships are mediocre is because you haven‚Äôt learned enough about communication.
(I wrote this section recently that ended up being highlighted by hundreds of people):
When my wife and I were in premarital counseling, our counselor gave us a piece of advice that would end up changing our lives:
Always make the first move.
The meaning is simple: if you can help the relationship, then do it. Don‚Äôt wait for the other person to act (even if you don‚Äôt want to).
Most people have strained and superficial relationships with family and even with friends. This is because most people always wait for the other person to ‚Äúmake the first move;‚Äù say hello, organize a hangout, or apologize.
This is a pride thing. It‚Äôs one of the main killers of marriages, friendships, and even families.
If you want to have deep, meaningful relationships with your friends, family, and even just the people in your day-to-day life, make the first move ‚Äî even if it should be them. Be the first to:
For a long time, I felt awkward and uncomfortable telling my brothers and sister ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù Three of the people whom I loved most in the entire world, and I couldn‚Äôt say it!
Now, I tell them I love them all the time. I say it over text, over casual phone calls, at crises, celebrations, and over the holidays. I tell my friends, too. Every single important person in my life ‚Äî mentors, family, friends, even coworkers, know how special they are to me.
It feels silly to be afraid to say this to a loved one. Yet, so many people can‚Äôt say a few simple words that would galvanize the entire relationship and deeply touch their soul.
Once you can do this, you can begin enjoying a gem most people never will: close, loving, life-giving relationships with many people.
In his book, No One Wants to Read Your Sh*t, New York Times Best-selling author Stephen Pressfield wrote:
In the same way artists and creatives can only connect with their audience through giving value, you can only truly connect with others when it stops being about you.
If you want deeply fulfilling relationships, you must give from yourself.
Give your time, attention, energy, love, and focus towards building and nurturing that relationship.
The individuals who do this are rare. But anyone who chooses to build their relationships like this are the ones who will have deep, meaningful relationships.
People with several deep, intimate relationships carry themselves differently. They treat their friends differently. They ask themselves specific questions that most people don‚Äôt even think of.
From a speech for alcoholics by marriage experts Dave and Polly P.:
Most people don‚Äôt ask themselves these hard questions. The truth is, if you have mediocre relationships, it‚Äôs likely because you‚Äôre being selfish, self-absorbed, or self-centered.
Can you say you‚Äôve been more selfless than selfish in the past few months?
Many people can‚Äôt.
The good news is, change is readily available.
All that is required is action.
Best-selling author Grant Cardone once wrote:
If you want to upgrade your relationships from mediocre to extraordinary, you must take actions you‚Äôve never taken before. Grant Cardone went on to write, ‚ÄúSuccess is just one of the byproducts of those who take the most action.‚Äù
Want incredible relationships, best friends, and an amazing partner?
Then take more action than you ever have before.
Most people carry severe baggage with them all day.
We‚Äôve all been hurt. We‚Äôve all been laughed at, excluded, beat up, put down, and forgotten.
A main difference between successful people and unsuccessful people is that successful people bring this garbage out in the open to heal it.
I could go on. I‚Äôm sure you could, too.
The reason people with successful, amazing relationships have them is because they‚Äôve chosen to address their own emotional garbage that prevents them from connecting.
If you want amazing relationships, you need to work on yourself first.
I saw my own life going down the toilet ‚Äî I was addicted to porn, had terrible unresolved family issues, and virtually nonexistent self-worth.
I made the choice to go to therapy, 12-step programs, and get all this crap out in the open.
It sucked. It required more of me than I‚Äôve ever had to give.
But my marriage with my wife is incomprehensibly amazing. I haven‚Äôt looked at porn in years. My wife teased me the other day that I have a million ‚Äúbro-mances.‚Äù She‚Äôs right ‚Äî I have a dozen guys that I know intimately, and they know me the same way.
If you want to upgrade your relationships from mediocre to extraordinary, then spend a lot of time, focus, and energy on making yourself better.
The amount of energy, focus, and care you put into making yourself better is proportionate to the level of relationships you‚Äôll have.
If you don‚Äôt invest in yourself...
If you don‚Äôt bother to learn how to communicate...
If you don‚Äôt care enough to learn how your loved ones want to be loved...
You‚Äôll always have mediocre relationships.
If you want amazing, high-quality relationships that will last for decades, you need to take action to learn how to do that. Take care of yourself, and heal what‚Äôs preventing you from connecting.

And not only not you, but often in a way that‚Äôs harmful to you, not genuine self-care.
i.e., things people do ‚Äúfor others‚Äù that are really for them.
i.e., a prerequisite to being able to love someone else.
Regardless of any of the above.
Way too many people worry about being ‚Äúfriend-zoned.‚Äù This is a misplaced concern. It‚Äôs a lot easier to transition a friendship into romance than to wring romantic feelings out of not even liking each other as people.
The bigger concern ‚Äî and what‚Äôs really happening for a lot of frustrated daters ‚Äî is that they barely even like you as a person.
They don‚Äôt care about your goals, your values, your fears, or your love language.
The big one is if they have a checklist of qualities they wanted in a partner and you happen to hit them. Or they have a list of stuff they‚Äôve always wanted to do with ‚Äúsomeone,‚Äù and now you‚Äôre working your way through it together. When asked what they like about you, they list different things than how you value yourself (especially if the first one is superficial, like looks.)
They adapted very little to ‚Äúaccommodate‚Äù you into their lives, and if you disappeared tomorrow, they‚Äôd just go on living exactly the same way they always have.
They make you laugh only because they get off on ‚Äúbeing funny.‚Äù They invite you on their trip because they just really want someone to travel with. They share books and music and film and restaurant suggestions because they just get off on sharing or being in the know ‚Äî or they need for you to like the same things ‚Äî not because they care about your opinion. Or they do nice gestures just because they have a deep need to feel ‚Äúappreciated‚Äù and influence over your happiness.
Somehow nothing is ever for them to own ‚Äî and they don‚Äôt want to. Their primary reaction is always to defend themselves, and they‚Äôre never to blame.
I don‚Äôt mean the occasional drifting. I mean a general, persistent feeling of ‚Äúawayness.‚Äù
One day they‚Äôre whispering sweet nothings in your ear, and then they go missing for two weeks.
Like ‚Äúbeautiful.‚Äù
They still make long-term plans without discussing it with you. They still propose weekend plans by saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs where I‚Äôll be if you wanna come.‚Äù
Their ask about your day in a way that‚Äôs half-hearted. They barely care about your struggles, and rarely share your celebrations.
They care about you and your wellbeing separate from themselves and their own.
Nobody can love without self-love. People without self-love will be seemingly ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù and ‚Äúself-less‚Äù but are actually using generosity to mask their deep-seated insecurity and need to build their self esteem around others emotional dependence on them.
They love you if they never check in on you loving them back. They love you if the energy is truly give, not give and ‚Äúnow-where‚Äôs-my-love-or-appreciation-back‚Äù take.
Without strings attached. When they‚Äôre invested in deeply understanding you. And they go out of their way to make you happy.
They rearrange their lives to fit you in.
People love themselves and their own lives, so if they start forgoing any of that to be with you, that‚Äôs a good sign.
It doesn‚Äôt have to be all their free time. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be every day. And it certainly doesn‚Äôt have to be as much as you want, if your idea of ‚Äúenough time‚Äù is higher than theirs. But they do prioritize you.
When you‚Äôre together, you‚Äôre together. They aren‚Äôt zoning out or interrupting while you‚Äôre talking, or eager for a distraction. Their mind is on the moment.
They use words. It may not be the three words you want most to hear, but there will be communication.
They‚Äôre supportive of whatever is most important to you.
Especially their future plans.
Your pain is their pain. Your happiness is their happiness. Your day is their day. Your aspirations are theirs, too.
Theirs as well as your own.

Kris Gage|18.1K|6|https://medium.com/@krisgage/oral-sex-doesnt-matter-c56c14a7afc3?source=tag_archive---------4---------------------|Oral Sex Is Not The Measure Of A Partner ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Music artist DJ Khaled recently admitted in a radio interview that he doesn‚Äôt perform oral sex on his wife, and now for some reason The World feels personally victimized by DJ Khaled.
Responses include but are not limited to,
Like, for real, he could‚Äôve said that he likes to leave all the lights on, or can only orgasm while listening to Kenny G, or has a weird, uncontrollable compulsion to constantly go down on his wife, and none of this makes any difference whatsoever to us, as people who do not personally have sex with DJ Khaled.
The only person who needs to like DJ Khaled‚Äôs opinion is DJ Khaled‚Äôs partner.
Somewhere along the way, we seem to have all decided that performing oral was some holy barometer of ‚Äúbeing a worthy partner.‚Äù
User @grownmanishpod polled,
In response to these results, user @JessLuvsDonuts declared,
And in response to that, user @OsamuonameO asked a pretty obvious question:
And yeah, I side with that.
Writer Dalyce Lazaris offered a guide on ‚Äúwhat it actually means to be the ‚Äòchill girl,‚Äô‚Äù (because we‚Äôre all stressin over such a thing, apparently.) She asserts that ‚Äúchill‚Äù can include things like ‚Äúbeing flexible about which movie to watch together‚Äù (oh thank god; at least we‚Äôve got the important shit covered), but draws an ALL CAPS line in the sand on the matter of oral sex by asserting:
Say what now? Says who? You? On what basis?
What if you prefer plain ole P-in-V vanilla? THEN WHAT, DALYCE???
And ‚ÄúSteve, 25‚Äù generously offered up this simple rule of thumb on oral sex as an easy measure of the relationship:
And, wow. I mean, that‚Äôs pure poetry...
Like ‚Äúoh, fuck ‚Äî that stranger on the internet said a dude isn‚Äôt into me if he doesn‚Äôt go down, so now that‚Äôs Another Thing I Have To Have. I can‚Äôt sleep at night until I can rest assured he loves me, as measured by his willingness to perform specific sex acts.‚Äù
GUYS, COME ON.
Not only that, but we‚Äôve made ‚Äúperforms oral‚Äù a barometer of a dude‚Äôs character overall.
I think we all recall Lisbeth Salander assessment of Mikael Blomkvist in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo:
Well, who the hell asked your opinion on his sex life, Girl Who Is Not (Yet) His Sexual Partner?
I mean, she is being asked to share her thoughts on the dude in this scene, but this is the most important thing she needs to share? This is what‚Äôs offered as summary of his character?
Or person.
I‚Äôve dated great partners who perform oral.
I‚Äôve dated dudes who loved performing oral sex (some even more than I cared to receive it, which was fucking weird and, frankly, pretty off-putting) and were fucking terrible partners.
And I‚Äôve dated absolutely amazing human beings who, for whatever reason, just don‚Äôt like doing it. And that‚Äôs fine.
My currently partner doesn‚Äôt go down on me, and I literally do not care. To be fair, it was never my favorite thing to begin with. But that aside, he is the best partner I‚Äôve ever had, and my measurement of satisfaction ‚Äî in bed and in general ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt hinge on a single sexual act.
That, and I respect his boundaries as a human being.
Doing so is just cheap, disrespectful and brimming with insecurity.
Maybe he is sexist. Maybe he is selfish. Maybe he does find it gross.
But forcing him to do it when he doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äî for whatever reason ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt actually resolve the underlying issue. It only covers it up and creates weird, abstracted problems. If you think your partner is selfish or sexist, then address the mindset, not the motions.
You want equality and kindness between genders? Then respect other people‚Äôs boundaries!
Stop and consider the obvious question here:
First of all: wanting or enjoying oral sex is not the same as demanding it. I have never once been with a partner who literally demanded oral sex (or swore he could only orgasm from oral.)
If you ARE with a dude who DOES demand it, then: That‚Äôs a respect problem that should be resolved on its own, not ‚Äúbalanced out‚Äù by you demanding oral as well. (And if he can‚Äôt get over himself, then you should leave.)
Either that is a lie, or you are completely out of tune with your own body.
Because saying that you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt orgasm without oral‚Äù means that you can‚Äôt bring yourself to orgasm during masturbation. Is that true?
Like, every time you‚Äôre aroused you have to beg or plead or hope that some other living person goes down on you? Come on!
If that‚Äôs truly the case, get your shit together, sister, and figure out how to give yourself physical pleasure, damn. Not being able to cum without cunnilingus is literally the opposite of okay. You have to be able to pleasure yourself, not put the responsibility for your pleasure solely in other people‚Äôs hands (or mouths.)
See above. You are out of touch with your own body.
Yes, it‚Äôs true that many women can‚Äôt orgasm from vaginal penetration alone. But ‚ÄúP in V‚Äù and ‚Äúoral‚Äù are not the only two sex acts, and there are other options that don‚Äôt involve coercing our partners.
I‚Äôm not surprised. But that doesn‚Äôt make me wrong.
Girl, no.
People with solid self esteem don‚Äôt need to subjugate their partners or have their status reaffirmed through specific sex acts.
Only cheap, flimsy ‚Äúpower‚Äù comes from shit like this.
‚ÄúGood partner‚Äù is about bigger things.
The real offense that DJ Khaled made was when he got into super sexist jargon like it‚Äôs 1951. But again ‚Äî we are not in his relationship. So whatever.
You do you, boo boo. Stay in your lane, and watch your shit. And when it comes to monitoring for good partners, watch for the right things.
Good partners care about their partner‚Äôs sexual satisfaction, yes. That is true. But good partners also care about their partners enough to treat them with the basic consideration that they expect.

Kris Gage|17.6K|6|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-you-know-it-isnt-love-56939a087080?source=tag_archive---------5---------------------|How You Know It Isn‚Äôt Love ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"Here are about a dozen ways to tell:
Don‚Äôt talk to me about peaks. Don‚Äôt talk to anybody about peaks ‚Äî not your partner, not your BFF, and especially not yourself.
Everyone experiences the elation of emotional peaks with their partners, and everybody wants to call these feelings ‚Äúlove,‚Äù especially early on. But these are fools gold, and even if you think ‚Äúthis one‚Äôs different, man,‚Äù I‚Äôll tell you again:love is never in the upside.
It‚Äôs in the valleys. And that‚Äôs where you know for sure.
What‚Äôs your gut reaction when things go south? What‚Äôs your lizard brain say when shit hits the fan? I‚Äôm not saying that you should listen to it ‚Äî lizard brains are notoriously stupid, and often need to be shushed and guided by more mature and developed thinking ‚Äî but I am saying you should notice.Because love is neither fight nor flight; love doubles-down, joins forces, makes it work. If your reaction is to throw punches or throw in the towel, it‚Äôs not love.
Look, just don‚Äôt talk about love in terms of feelings ‚Äî and this definitely includes ‚Äúinfatuation‚Äù or ‚Äúpreoccupation‚Äù or ‚Äúobsession‚Äù or ‚Äúcan‚Äôt live without‚Äù (see above.)
Talk about feelings all you want ‚Äî they are incredibly wonderful parts of the human experience ‚Äî and feel All Of The Feelings for your partner, because those are some of the juiciest. Just also understand that love is a choice, an active decision, and a series of investments and efforts and actions. Theproblem with defining love as ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù is twofold: 1.) it makes for immature relationships, and 2.) leaves us susceptible to one day ‚Äúnot feeling it‚Äù and folding.
Not just for a moment (because that happens to all of us) and also not as the result of depression (look into that to make sure), but rather a pervasivefeeling of not actually connecting.
This is different than feelings ‚Äúfading,‚Äù as mentioned above. You can still care deeply for someone but feel lonely every time you‚Äôre together. If you don‚Äôt actually connect, it will never be the making of a rich relationship.
I dated one dude for a while, when we were young and dumb and didn‚Äôt know what we didn‚Äôt know, and we thought this was well enough how love was supposed to look. But I can pinpoint the exact moment I realized we should break up. We were at the mall, killing time on another empty afternoon, not even walking around or actually shopping but just standing there, leaning on a railing and looking down at a lower level. And all of a sudden I was overcome with this immense loneliness ‚Äî not in the moment, but rather the sudden and undeniable realization that I was always lonely with him. We were never truly together; never really seeing each other eye to eye; instead just rushing around to distract ourselves from it. And once we stopped and stared at nothing long enough for me to see it, I couldn‚Äôt go back to unseeing.
Honestly, I either have no idea what ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù means or I just bundle it into other things (like ‚Äúintellectual companions,‚Äù and ‚Äúfriendship,‚Äù and ‚Äúconversation,‚Äù see below.)
But I guess it‚Äôs worth including because so many people do: if you continually come back to ‚Äúthe way your partner looks on paper‚Äù to defend the relationship to yourself, it‚Äôs probably going south.
This, as I said, is probably just my ‚Äúchemistry,‚Äù but either way it is, in my mind, a very important, stand-alone thing.
I dated a dude for five years who was plenty ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and successful in his own right, but he and I fundamentally operated in very different ways. I never felt as though I had an intellectual companion, and I spent years thinking, ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs fine ‚Äî we all make sacrifices in love. There is no perfect partner.‚Äù
But there‚Äôs a difference between rooting for different sports teams and being able to have the conversations you care most about. When I shared my most cherished thoughts or abstract questions ‚Äî like ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it interesting how people choose to build their lives?‚Äù ‚Äî looking to volley answers or even (dream big!) build a full-blown discussion, he would absentmindedly quell it with, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way things are ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt mean anything.‚Äù Full stop.
When it comes to a ‚Äúlife partner,‚Äù make sure they‚Äôre actually there for the ‚Äúlife stuff.‚Äù
Like if you share big news with your partner (you got promoted, won a deal, quit that job you hated, whatever) they shouldn‚Äôt sound as though you just said you grabbed milk on the way home.
Ditto for death.
They should hug you if you‚Äôre crying, offer to go to the services (and actually go, if you want them to and they can), and refrain from making jokes too soon or demanding brownie points if they order flowers. This is easy stuff, guys. Yet it‚Äôs amazing how many people eff this up.
After my brother died unexpectedly (and then a job offer fell through only after I‚Äôd quit my previous position), I came down with the worst cold (or flu) of my life ‚Äî the kind where your nose simply won‚Äôt stop running and you can‚Äôt manage basic functions and you‚Äôre so physically fatigued you can‚Äôt even go to the grocery to get drugs for it. My boyfriend and I lived together at the time, but he was so oblivious that after a day and a half I dragged myself, zombie-like, to the drug store two blocks away and bought my own meds, and was so exhausted by the time I got back that I crashed on the couch for hours afterwards.
For anybody who‚Äôs sitting there thinking, ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you just ask him?‚Äù Iseriously encourage you to reevaluate your standards of basic human decency and awareness. Normally ‚Äúasking‚Äù is correct. But damn, son.
With the biggest catalyst being ‚Äúmoving.‚Äù
When they move across the country (or the world) and you are in no way inclined to follow (except, perhaps, ‚Äúfor the adventure.‚Äù) Or, vice versa, when you feel compelled to move across the country but only half-care if they come.
If you think you love someone because they‚Äôre ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù or ‚Äúgiving‚Äù or ‚Äúmake you feel good‚Äù or some other self-serving pleasure, then you should realize: that‚Äôs not real love.
That‚Äôs not to say you don‚Äôt (or can‚Äôt) really love them, but ‚Äúthe pleasure they give you‚Äù (or, in codependent cases, the pleasure you give them) can never be the foundation.
Just go re-read the first section, honestly.
Mature love is based on healthy non-attachment
I don‚Äôt understand how anybody could ever think it‚Äôs ‚Äúromantic‚Äù for someone to declare, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to marry you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have kids with you‚Äù shortly after meeting them.
Gross. Get out of here with that grabby shit.
One dude I dated said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make you my wife‚Äù within a couple months of knowing me, and my knee jerk reaction was: ‚Äúwow ‚Äî does he not realize I have a say in this?‚Äù
The most interesting part was: I had come home from our first date feeling the same way. But the fact that he said it so matter of factly, without me ever verbally weighing in on the matter, turned me off so much it couldn‚Äôt be salvaged. It wasn‚Äôt cute and it wasn‚Äôt romantic ‚Äî even though our feelings had once aligned, because I realized that that fact didn‚Äôt actually matter to him.
It was presumptuous and off-putting and poor form. If you find this romantic, you really need to check your idea of personal agency and emotionalboundaries.
And that realization is, on the one hand, weird ‚Äî because I make decisions like this all the time with my partners (love is, after all, choice and commitment) so I‚Äôm not sure where the line is in whether ‚Äúdeciding‚Äù is love or ownership. Maybe it has to do with actually knowing the other person (as discerned by them, not you.) Either way, all I know is that when it aligns in the right way, it feels really good. And when it doesn‚Äôt, and they claim more of you than you offered or chose, it‚Äôs heart-wrenching. And it‚Äôs only worse if youdid choose or offer, only differently or less, because they don‚Äôt care and your left standing there with your heart in your hand.
Fear and love can‚Äôt coexist. If your primary anxiety around the idea of breaking up is ‚Äúfear of being alone,‚Äù it isn‚Äôt love.
Embracing each other as individual human beings with individual human being lives, who just happen to get along enough to bump down the road alongside one another.
Then, mutual investment and support in each other‚Äôs growth, especially when things get rough or scary. But always complementary, never to complete one another. And always with care and compassion.
Or clap or follow!

Tracy Moore|4.1K|6|https://medium.com/mel-magazine/men-get-sad-after-sex-now-we-have-a-concrete-answer-why-ae4fc490613b?source=tag_archive---------6---------------------|Men Get Sad After Sex. Now We Have a Concrete Answer Why|"The universe doesn‚Äôt always make sense. Good things don‚Äôt always feel great. Case in point: For some men, getting laid makes them really sad. But there‚Äôs good news, or at least a better understanding of what‚Äôs behind this phenomenon called postcoital dysphoria, or PCD. It‚Äôs proof that dudes are generally far more complicated that anyone gives them credit for.
It‚Äôs been a long time coming. Last year, we told you that psychology professor Robert Schweitzer of Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, was trying to find out why men get PCD, which he was aware of anecdotally but which hadn‚Äôt been properly investigated in men. Schweitzer had already researched and identified PCD in women, some 46 percent of whom say they‚Äôve experienced it in their lifetime. Their reasons vary but are related to anything from a history of sexual trauma to fear of abandonment to not getting off.
Ahead of Schweitzer‚Äôs call for answers last year, we asked men to tell us why they might get bummed out after sex. Their reasons:
There were other theories out there about why men might be inclined to get the post-sex blues. Largely, it was presumed that men, hardwired to fuck strong, must feel some essence of their maleness has been lost once they‚Äôre spent, and that this realization creates a natural sadness.
But Schweitzer‚Äôs research, which came out this week, is enlightening: Some 41 percent of men have experienced PCD in their lifetime, almost as many as women. And the reasons are typically one or more of the following: psychological distress, past sexual trauma or sexual dysfunction.
There‚Äôs no evolutionary-psychology bullshit here: Men who are stressed out, have been abused or have trouble getting it up can very well feel bummed out after fucking. That‚Äôs not shocking. But hey, we can never get enough reminders that men are human, too.
To conduct the research, Schweitzer ultimately surveyed about 1,200 dudes from 18 to 81 years of age from 78 different countries who said they were sexually active. The majority were not religious. Most had been in a relationship for at least a year, and considered themselves sexually satisfied with said relationship. They answered a 30-minute online survey of 14 questions about their sexual orientation, length of and satisfaction with their current relationship, and history of sexual dysfunction (including history of premature or delayed ejaculation, hypoactive sexual desire disorder and erectile dysfunction).
They also answered questions determining depression or anxiety levels, as well as history of sexual abuse or childhood trauma. Then they were asked whether they‚Äôd ever experienced ‚Äúinexplicable tearfulness, sadness or irritability following consensual sexual activity‚Äù either in the last four weeks, or ever.
The results: Some 41 percent of men had experienced PCD in their lifetime. About 20 percent had experienced it in the last four weeks. Around 4 percent said they experienced it ‚Äúmost or all of the time.‚Äù That‚Äôs interesting enough ‚Äî as noted before, around 46 percent of women have felt PCD, and around 4 percent also say they experience it all the time.
But the men who do so often had a history of sexual or emotional abuse in childhood, depression or anxiety, and more often, hypoactive sexual desire disorder ‚Äî or a general lack of sexual desire. (It used to be called ‚Äúbeing frigid,‚Äù and is mostly something you hear about related to women, who make up 33 percent of the reports of the disorder, compared with only 20 percent of men.) They were also more likely to experience premature or delayed ejaculation.
Participants described their own feelings in greater depth, and those who did wrote the following:
Schweitzer notes that the results show that the male experience in the resolution phase of sex are not always positive, and ‚Äúmay be far more varied, complex and nuanced than previously thought.‚Äù
He tells MEL that this sort of research is important, not just because it helps us understand that it can happen to men and women, but also because it helps undo the biases we have about how men relate to sex.
Even though the research doesn‚Äôt connect all the whats with the corresponding whys ‚Äî when asked why gay men were at a greater predisposition for PCD, he couldn‚Äôt answer that from the research itself ‚Äî it turns out that generally, this supports the notion that all men are not, in fact, prowling horn-dogs who will do anything to get laid and who put little other thought into the act than simply scoring another notch.
‚ÄúMen are not considered to be as interested in intimacy, are responsible for initiating, some would say, don‚Äôt discriminate, and are interested in ‚Äòconquest,‚Äô‚Äù Schweitzer writes. ‚ÄúNo doubt there are many other prejudices we have. There may well be support for some of these assumptions, but more importantly, we would argue, these are all generalizations, and in actual fact, the sexual experience for both women and for men is more varied than commonly acknowledged.‚Äù
While this research is only the beginning, Schweitzer says it‚Äôs a start to understanding what will help men have better sexual experiences, and how we might manage PCD when it comes up.
Schweitzer says at least one woman who experienced PCD benefited from psychotropics to manage the sadness. And awareness alone is always the first step on the path to normalizing any experience. But more than anything, it‚Äôs proof that in the end, talking about how we feel and our experiences is the first step toward solving them.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably most important to be able to have open discussions about experiences, free of embarrassment or shame,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúThe very act of open discussion around the experience may be helpful. This has been our experience in relation to feedback in response to PCD in females.‚Äù

John Gorman|20K|7|https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-art-of-intimacy-75bd969f6b4b?source=tag_archive---------7---------------------|The Art of Intimacy ‚Äì Personal Growth ‚Äì Medium|"Some time ago, I read ‚ÄúThe Opposite of Loneliness,‚Äù by Marina Keegan, a 22 year-old writing prodigy, killed in a car accident upon graduation from Yale University. She opened her award-winning essay, which spawned an extraordinary, posthumous bestselling book of the same name, with perhaps the most succinct distillation of human suffering ever articulated in print.
There are two profound tragedies of the human condition: Loneliness is one. Impermanence is the other. Loneliness is a tragedy of space. Impermanence is a tragedy of time. Humans are felled by their bodies ‚Äî prisons that confine us to only where and when we exist. Today, we‚Äôll focus exclusively on trying to subvert loneliness. We‚Äôll explore loneliness in an attempt to find its ‚Äúopposite.‚Äù
To find the word for the opposite of loneliness, we first need to define the word itself. Loneliness is commonly articulated as the sensational byproduct of being physically, mentally or emotionally alone. For example, if you had moved to a new city, or started a new job, and maybe the others would initially look at you like you‚Äôd grown a second head, as a curious interloper from another planet thrust into a foreign culture. That‚Äôs almost loneliness, but still not quite right. Real loneliness runs deeper than that. It‚Äôs feeling alone even when you aren‚Äôt actually alone.
Have you ever had the overwhelming sense of being alone, despite a venerable cornucopia of people you could call to knock back a cocktail or 12? Do you, perhaps, go out, and then stumble home at 3 a.m. and choke half to death on your own self-loathing? Each early morning ending exactly as the day began, no closer to those you‚Äôd gallivanted around with, and your cat silently judging you, while your friends text you and say ‚ÄúMan, that shit was epic?‚Äù Yet you still feel apart? Grand loneliness can arrive cloaked in a long con of community. Succinctly: Loneliness isn‚Äôt feeling like you don‚Äôt really know anybody. It‚Äôs feeling like nobody could ever really know you. How does this manifest itself?
When you‚Äôre with people, you speak and receive faint nods of approval, off-hand laughter, and pithy responses to zingers or outside-the-box thoughts. You might share a common ground, a common goal or a common interest. You disperse to bond another day. And yet you‚Äôre still left wondering why it isn‚Äôt clicking. You may describe your relationship with the world as a car in second gear, a fire-hose bulging and bursting from the inside-out, yet a mere mist when sprayed at its target. Loneliness is an unfulfilled desire for connection with others, a loathing and resignation that‚Äôs directed inward ... the electrical voltage that sparks connection reversed and turned upon itself, paralyzing you the way a Taser would. You‚Äôve watched your authentic self wall itself off from others; the communication with the outside world is tense and terse.
Guarded sharing is risk mitigation applied to social settings. It‚Äôs a series of quick-win verbal habits that are designed to be snackable content IRL. Everyone loves a biting wit, a compliment or good news. Bring enough of it to enough people and you‚Äôll make them feel warm and fuzzy all over. These are oral slap-singles, and they‚Äôre nearly a bulletproof way to be likable. Maybe you‚Äôve done this. I‚Äôve done this often. In fact ... it is my default setting. Make people smile and laugh and then vanish into the ether.
I don‚Äôt suppose I need to tell you this makes me a hit at parties, and also, surprisingly awkward. And here‚Äôs the stinging truth: A lot of likable people are completely lonely. Picture a homeless man who smiles, says ‚ÄúI love that shirt,‚Äù and wishes you ‚Äúa blessed day‚Äù before retreating to the solace of his overpass shelter. And you can also see examples of this scrolling through your your apps.
Let‚Äôs talk about social media for a minute. We craft these burgeoning social networks, and (supposedly) gleefully over-share in the hopes that somebody, anybody, will relate to us. Perhaps you‚Äôve widened your network to one, two, three thousand people that you consider friends, or sought out an avalanche of hearts and likes on a professionally candid photo, or a status that doubles as an epic depiction of your success, or a meme articulating distrust of the government. Perhaps you‚Äôve occasionally received that validation and it momentarily made you feel less lonely inside. Perhaps the words and pictures were so good and rang so true that they could not, nor shall not, be ignored.
But when all reaction is currency, and all reaction is cursory, self-loathing and self-doubt and the other two horsemen of the self-pocalypse ride into our virtual town. What your writing and posting and taste in YouTube videos say about you is, ultimately, that you‚Äôre worth listening to. I‚Äôve experienced this on Facebook, in response to cross-posting my many Medium pieces. But is that a precursor for becoming less lonely?
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so vulnerable,‚Äù my friends would tell me. ‚ÄúIt takes so much strength, courage and guts to bleed onto the keyboard for all to see.‚Äù
Ahhh ... but the masses have been duped. For what I share with anyone isn‚Äôt indicative of any sort of emotional vulnerability. I am broadcasting ‚Äî a far less personal or emotionally risky endeavor than conversation. Broadcasting things may make you someone worth listening to, but only conversation can confirm to people that you‚Äôre someone worth truly knowing. Those two ideas, and those two classes of people, are poles apart. Becoming someone worth knowing requires reciprocity and vulnerability. It requires actual investment of emotional capital into people you wish to know. And there‚Äôs only a fixed amount allotted for distribution, in a deeper way than taking 15 seconds to ‚Äúlike‚Äù and comment, anyway.
Keeping up an actual friendship requires resources. To be someone worth knowing requires real human interaction: conversing beyond quips and quick-hits, seeing and sharing activities beyond Buzzfeed links, expressing differences, changing minds, passionately defending the points that define our character, coming through when it matters, asking for (and offering) favors. This is what makes this life worth living. When we‚Äôre lonely, what we‚Äôre really craving is more connecting, not more connections. Stumbling home after 3 a.m. exhausting every truth we have in our arsenal, armor laid at the feet of our social sparring partners. And that leads us back to the opposite of loneliness.
The opposite of loneliness is intimacy ‚Äî the act of revealing your whole self to someone else and having them reciprocate. It is something you can only do one-on-one, face-to-face, soul-to-soul. When we stop taking hacks at softball pitches and start swinging for the fences, our acts and ideas first clear, then crumble, the walls we‚Äôve built to protect ourselves. Intimacy is an act of love, an act of self-love, and an act of defiance all in one. It‚Äôs gritty, emotional, raw, unfiltered, unabashed, unpretentious and unguarded. It‚Äôs more than talking about things together. It‚Äôs being and becoming about things together.
For what are we in this world if not connectable, interlocking parts? What is this joy, suffering, talent and wisdom, if not to be shared and imparted? How much has gone wasted or unremedied due to our inability for intimacy, our own tight-lipped, tightly-wound tendencies? A soul is not a silo, a mind is not a mine. We worship, learn, aid, sing, watch, call, visit, fuck, create, talk, love, try, read and write to bring ourselves closer. To make whole what we lack in the emptiness of loneliness. Each deeper connection creates deeper character, with more room to grow, more to lose and more to become. A heart unbroken is a life unwagered. A dream undashed is a life unlived. To play safe, to play solo, is to play a fool‚Äôs game ‚Äî we may find success in rising above the rest, but we may only win by lifting up others. This requires intimacy. There are no workarounds.
Indeed, we‚Äôre only unburdened when we let our heart hang out the window to dry ‚Äî when we let it be warmed, broken, run over by a semi, lifted, toyed with, and embraced. Intimacy requires the courage to make enemies as easily as we make friends, and watch the world dare to stand with us.
This is how we beat back the gray twilight of loneliness and find ourselves in the company of those we‚Äôve challenged to truly see and accept us for who we are. It‚Äôs that feeling of two (or more!) human vessels for unchecked, unabashed, unmitigated joy reciprocating that truth, love and splendor between each other, a game of emotional and intellectual catch where neither drops the ball. It is the transcendence of body as prison, and it is the momentary defeat of our uniquely human tragedy.
We don‚Äôt have a word for that feeling yet, but if we did, I could say that‚Äôs what I want in life.

Kris Gage|10.1K|7|https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-much-to-give-and-take-in-relationships-ccbdf31e2f4e?source=tag_archive---------8---------------------|How Much To Give And Take In Relationships ‚Äì Kris Gage ‚Äì Medium|"I always have a big question in my head, and it‚Äôs always about love ‚Äî and life.
After I broke up with my boyfriend of five years in 2014, my question was around ‚Äúpersonal agency‚Äù and ‚Äúreal love‚Äù ‚Äî specifically, whether someone can really love us if they see us differently (lesser and more superficially) than we see ourselves; if there is no ‚Äútrue‚Äù reality, then which version of ‚Äúus‚Äù is real? Do we get final say in who we are and how we want to be seen (and loved?) (Side note: after 3 years and countless books, Emma Lindsay‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúFish Love‚Äù is the closest and best answer I found.)
Last year, it was around emotional abuse ‚Äî and what constitutes it ‚Äî which lead to healthy vs. toxic love. (bell hooks had the best answers here.)
And that evolved into my big question this year, which is around ‚Äúemotional boundaries.‚Äù
If you don‚Äôt agree, it‚Äôs almost certainly because you don‚Äôt (yet) realize you struggle with them. Because pretty much the only people with healthy emotional boundaries are the ones who have conscientiously and deliberately put in the emotion work to build them.
We don‚Äôt learn them from our family. (In fact, if anything, we learn the opposite from our families, most of whom are either too invasive, too dependent, or too enabling and end up encouraging our dependency on them.)
We can‚Äôt learn them from media, which is so ill with bad relationship and love models it should all be regarded as satire at best.
And we don‚Äôt learn them from others, because everyone struggles with them (see above) and some even see ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù as being ‚Äúclosed off.‚Äù These people have a lot of emotion work to do, and should get their hands on some codependence reading.
This leaves the internet and books, but most of the advice there is equally bad.
A lot of relationship books don‚Äôt even address the concept of emotional boundaries (or emotional health) ‚Äî or worse, they actively encourage people to develop unhealthy ones, which sets everyone up for suffering.
Even books on boundaries beat around the bush, instead covering ‚Äúhow important they are‚Äù (great; duh) or ‚Äúhow to stand up for yourself‚Äù and ‚Äúsay no.‚Äù But those aren‚Äôt the real issue we have, evidenced by the fact that most of us sway erratically from one end of the spectrum to the other in attempt to find balance. We first find ourselves feeling ‚Äúwalked on‚Äù and then pick a fight over stupid shit to get even.
So far most books fail to address the real issue in emotional boundaries:
We all understand the logistics of how to not eat a cookie. (You say ‚Äúno thank you,‚Äù you don‚Äôt pick it up, you don‚Äôt take a bite. Done.) That‚Äôs not the hard part.
The hard part is discerning whether or not we really want to eat the cookie.
If we don‚Äôt eat the cookie, are we avoiding it from a position of peace, or self-punishment ‚Äî or pride? If we eat the cookie, is it with pleasure or lack of self-love? Do we actually want it? Will we regret it tomorrow? Do we want it because we‚Äôre bored, or we‚Äôve had a beer, or a stressful day, or our host is extending it to us on a plate and smiling at us with those eyes that plead, ‚Äúplease ‚Äî I spent an hour baking these.‚Äù Are any of those real desires? Should any of those be regarded as real desires? Is a cookie ever an appropriate vehicle for satisfying them? Is it ever appropriate to just say ‚Äúah, fuck it‚Äù and eat the cookie without identifying our real, underlying needs?
This is the hard part with boundaries ‚Äî understanding what we truly want, beneath the surface, and what‚Äôs healthy.
And a simple, innocent cookie bears like 1/1000th the weight of a person.
And if you think I‚Äôm maybe overthinking the cookie thing, I‚Äôll remind you: the cookie was a metaphor, bud. For boundaries. And if anything, we‚Äôre under-thinking those.
Before anybody gets pissy over that, let me clarify: you are entitled to feel your feelings. But that doesn‚Äôt mean your feelings are always reasonable or anybody else‚Äôs problem. And without emotion work, they can‚Äôt define emotional boundaries.
Resources on emotional boundaries often advise the reader to simply ‚Äúunderstand what upsets, hurts, or offends‚Äù us. One article said, ‚ÄúWhen you feel anger or resentment or find yourself whining or complaining, you probably need to set a boundary. Listen to yourself, determine what you need to do or say, then communicate assertively.‚Äù
What horrible advice.
I mean, maybe, sometimes that‚Äôs valid. But maybe (most times) you need to deal with your own emotions before putting them back on others. Maybe your reason for feeling anger or resentment or jealousy or insecurity is your own problem.
If everyone followed bad advice like the above, we‚Äôd all be running around with the emotional development of children, believing every whimper that crossed our tiny brains had to be validated and honored.
Guys, no. Part of being an adult (and developing emotional boundaries) is also about being able to discern which emotions are yours alone to deal with, and not project on others.
Sometimes people struggle to stand up for their feelings. Sometimes people struggle to understand the world isn‚Äôt responsible for soothing everything they feel. Most people struggle with discerning the difference, and bounce back and forth between the two.
So: the question here is on emotion work, really. How to manage our own emotions, and being able to appropriately discern what‚Äôs ours to fix (hint: most of it), and what‚Äôs valid / for other people.
Often these resources brush people off with advice like: ‚Äúknow your boundary and then say no.‚Äù And to that shit I‚Äôm like, thanks Barbara.
The problem is we‚Äôre all so bad at it, so we don‚Äôt have the privilege of trusting our own judgment yet. So who decides? Or, better yet: how do we know when we can? What if we don‚Äôt care? Should we?
I grab fries off my partner‚Äôs plate and borrow his clothes all the time without asking. I moved across the country for him. I listen when he jumps straight to ‚Äúproblem solving‚Äù when I share something.
Are those poor boundaries?? Even if neither of us cares, should we? Hell, even if we think we‚Äôre happy, should we be?
We are subconsciously socialized to empathize with other people‚Äôs feelings, but then we‚Äôre told not to take on other people‚Äôs feelings.
We‚Äôre told to ‚Äústand up for ourselves‚Äù but also ‚Äúsurrender to love.‚Äù We‚Äôre told to ‚Äúsay no‚Äù but never ‚Äúshut down.‚Äù
We‚Äôre warned against becoming ‚Äúemotionally exhausted‚Äù after talking to others, but we‚Äôre also warned against ‚Äúwithdrawing‚Äù or ‚Äúwalling others out.‚Äù
We‚Äôre told ‚Äúthe opposite of love is not ‚Äòhate‚Äô but ‚Äòapathy‚Äô‚Äù (or maybe ‚Äúfear?‚Äù), which means loving is caring ‚Äî but what‚Äôs too much?
We‚Äôre not supposed to sacrifice our dreams for relationships, but most dreams are fantasies anyway. (Would you reeaally move to a cabin in Vermont??)
When it comes to others‚Äô emotions, it makes sense: be open to others but don‚Äôt take on their emotions as your own. Fine. It‚Äôs not actually as clear it sounds, in practice, but it‚Äôs fine enough on paper. (Eat the cookie without becoming it. Eat the cookie without needing to identify as ‚Äúcookie eater.‚Äù Fine.)
But what about our own emotions, thoughts, preferences, ideas? And how should those two come together? How do we make this all work? How do we discern and compromise?
Like: it‚Äôs always bad when people try to change their partners. Except it‚Äôs not always bad, because there are caveats like: if their habit is objectively bad, like smoking. But what if it‚Äôs subjectively bad, or just sort of bad? Who gets to decide? Do they compromise? Should both have to give 50% if the habit is only regarding one person‚Äôs body or life? How much agency do we have over one another? And how does their agency affect our own?
It all comes down to better understanding of ‚Äî and responsibility for ‚Äî our own feelings and thoughts and what we truly want most, and expecting the same of people in our life.

It can be tempting to settle for second best. To settle for what‚Äôs here, in front of us, especially when it looks a whole lot better than loneliness.
It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm telling you that you have to wait around for someone who sees you as their Dream Partner. I‚Äôm not saying to wait around for your Dream Partner. In fact, I‚Äôm saying the opposite. I‚Äôm saying that we should have good values ‚Äî and we should find partners that have good values. And good values means not holding out for some idealized image of perfection ‚Äî or settling for someone who‚Äôs measuring us the same way.
I‚Äôm saying you deserve someone who‚Äôs got their head on straight and their values in the right place and wakes up each morning, looks at you ‚Äî in your utterly imperfect human-being-ness ‚Äî and still thinks to themselves, ‚Äúaww yeah.‚Äù
Maybe you care for each other. Or maybe you just want to care for each other. Maybe you want them, but you‚Äôd want them even more if only.
Don‚Äôt live your life that way. Don‚Äôt treat other human beings that way. And don‚Äôt let other human beings regard you that way. Don‚Äôt settle for a partner who looks at you across the table and internally sighs, ‚Äúnot perfect, but they‚Äôll do.‚Äù
Look for someone who smiles, ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî I want them.‚Äù And, equally important, be that person back.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if everything is there if they always hold ‚Äúperfection‚Äù over your head. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre their favorite person to talk to, or they‚Äôre secure with you, or they spend all their free time with you, and ‚Äúevery moment together feels as natural as anything you‚Äôve ever known.‚Äù
If they‚Äôre holding out for something ‚Äúslightly better,‚Äù run. That‚Äôs not to say that ‚Äúbetter‚Äù isn‚Äôt out there ‚Äî it‚Äôs to say that we shouldn‚Äôt settle for people who enter into relationships like they‚Äôre something to maximize.
Because there will always be someone more attractive, younger, smarter, more novel (obvs), more fun, whatever.
If they want to chase phantoms, fucking let them. Don‚Äôt settle for that shit.
Imagine how heartbroken you‚Äôd feel if you met someone absolutely incredible ‚Äî only to meet their partner and realize they regarded them as ‚Äújust okay.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs how someone out there will feel meeting you and your partner if you settle for someone who does this.
You deserve better. We all do.
If they are holding out for something, leave. If they aren‚Äôt sure, leave. If they have reasons ‚Äî timing, not being ready, busy, doesn‚Äôt want to ruin it, etc. ‚Äî then bounce. If they cared, they wouldn‚Äôt want to risk it. So leave if they do.
You deserve more than someone who isn‚Äôt sure.
Writer Lacey Ramburger wrote,
You are a person, not a throw pillow. You add value as a complex and imperfect human being.
Wait for someone who sees you as special, not a chore or checkbox. Let someone else step up and do exactly what you‚Äôve been hoping for ‚Äî choose you, right now. With whatever they have to offer.
